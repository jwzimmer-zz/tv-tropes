In any event, some people we haven't seen much of or in a while are taking center stage... but what's this? Why are some of the <em>main</em> characters completely absent?

They don't even get a non-speaking cameo even though they should be involved with the plot at hand, or at least present in the location. It stretches belief for Bob and Alice to have a long chat in Mary's Bar and there be no Mary in sight (especially since it turns out she and Alice were just revealed to be fraternal twins separated at birth last episode).
</p><p>The reason usually has something to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Maybe the actor <em>is</em> sick or otherwise unavailable  but not <em>so</em> unavailable that the writers have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">drop a bridge on them</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put them on a round trip bus</a>. Maybe the producers need to save money and can't afford to pay them for the episode (hey, every dollar saved goes to pay for that big grand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>!)  in fact, some actors' contracts restrict them to appearing in only a certain number of episodes each season. After all, <em>you</em> get days off work  sometimes actors do, too! Maybe there was just nothing for the character to do that episode. If it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode">Lower-Deck Episode</a> then it could easily be said the character was just doing something else that day, but usually explanations for the absence given in show are way too flimsy to explain a total absence  just how unavailable can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Picard</a> be if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome">he's at the hair salon</a> for this week's crisis?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> can be pretty bad at this at times. Especially with Beelzebumon, who despite stating that he'll <em>always</em> be somewhere near Taiki to help out if he ever needs him, still has a tendency to be completely absent for several episodes straight with no explaination given. Gets even weirder when one considers that his voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaisukeKishio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaisukeKishio">Daisuke Kishio</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">voiced at least two other recurring characters in the show</a>, and even in episodes where Beelzebumon didn't appear, one of his other roles would often be there anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> does this, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">written-in absences</a>, every few episodes (and to varying degrees). Milfeulle, Forte, Ranpha, Mint, and Vanilla, all take turns disappearing from episodes, giving the audience a chance to focus on specific groupings and pairings such as Milfeulle/Forte/Ranpha only, or Mint/Vanilla. Taken to this trope's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalExtreme">logical extreme</a> in that over the run of all seasons collectively, every girl has at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">one episode</a> that <em>solely</em> depicts them with the absence of all four other girls. This all said, there's just as many episodes in which this trope isn't used at all, and all five Brigade members are present and active.
</li><li> An important plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>, all of the main characters are never seen together, not even in the openings, when they stand side by side. And if you pay attention, you'll notice that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">optimistic, enthusiastic and energetic protagonist, Kafuka Fuura</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">albeit, one whose smile is probably covering up her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">traumatic past</a>, is almost never present during them, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">full openings, or specials</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's because she died long before the series began, and began to inhabit her classmates' bodies after they each got her donor organs, in order to stop the entire class - and probably even the whole of Japan - from committing suicide. In the end, her entire class forget that she even existed, except from the teacher, Itoshiki Nozomu, who ends up marrying and divorcing his entire class - including Jun Kudou, the only male to be possesed by Kafuka - in order to find her. A very odd and sad end to a long running and darkly comic Gag Series.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>: In several later episodes, Koyuki just disappears. When she doesn't have a speaking role, she often isn't even drawn among the students in Natsumi's class.
</li><li> Since the main character actually is two separate people in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, this happens a few times during the series VERY long run. But most notably, during one and a half of the Scarlet return episodes (Episode 779-783), Conan/Shinichi succeeds to be almost completely absent AND contribute to the plot at the same time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Liar.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Prior to the Best Wishes series, in which they started to appear less frequently, Team Rocket trio was absent only in a couple of episodes: "Pokémon - I Choose You!" (the very first episode) and "Ash and May! Heated Battles of Hoenn!!" (a clip show which recapped Ash's Gym Battles and May's Contests in the Hoenn region <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">that was never dubbed</a>).
</li><li> There were a couple of <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl</em> series episodes where Dawn's Piplup and/or Jessie's Wobbuffet don't appear such as "The Keystone Pops!".
</li><li> A number of episodes in the <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> series have only one of Ash's classmates appear alongside him, for example Sophocles is the only one appearing in "A Shocking Grocery Run!".
</li><li> The thirty-second episode of <em>Pokémon Journeys</em> is the first in the entire series to not feature Ash or Pikachu.

<ul><li> Chapter 61 is the only one to completely lack Kobayashi, Tohru, Kanna, and Ilulu.
</li><li> There are chapters taking place in Kobayashi's apartment in <em>Kanna's Daily Life</em> where Ilulu is completely absent, even when she should logically be present (or at least mentioned). This is lampshaded during her first appearance, with a caption that says "sometimes she's here, sometimes she isn't."

However, Himespetchi, the space princess character who is known for her crush on main character Mametchi, doesn't even appear as one of the background cameos, which seems strange as she's a notable character in the modern incarnations of the franchise and serves a major role in several episodes of the TV show.
</li><li> Max is inexplicably absent in episode 22 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> when he should normally be seen training with the others.

This is because of a framing device where Simon is making a video essay in order to get admitted into a college.

The character was still around and at Grace Brothers, issuing orders via telephone or memo, but he was never seen nor heard.

<ul><li> During the first season, there were a number of episodes in which Buster or Tobias were absent (fortunately, they've never been both been absent in one episode). Curiously, this may be why Tony Hale and David Cross were credited last aside from the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">And Starring</a>" credits for Jeffrey Tambor and Jessica Walter. In fact had he had perfect attendance Cross might have been put right before Will Arnett or even Portia de Rossi, as he, aside from Jason Bateman, Tambor and Walter, was arguably the most established star going into the show.
</li><li> For the next two seasons, Buster and Tobias would have perfect attendance, as would the rest of the cast, even if only for a small part (i.e. Lindsay only appearing in one scene in "Queen for a Day"), or not coming in until the episode is past the halfway point (i.e. Lucille in "Righteous Brothers"). There was one exception: "For British Eyes Only" did not feature Maeby. Given that George Michael appeared in only a single scene that episode, it is assumed that there was a subplot involving the two that was scrapped because Alia Shawkat was unable to make it to the episode, and the episode was rewritten at the last minute with George Michael's scene only serving to squeeze him into the episode.
</li><li> For season 4, this was much more common. Michael was the only character to appear in every episode of the season. This was somewhat understandable, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsTheEnd">actors</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">were</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpAllNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpAllNight">busy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Veep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Veep">with</a> other projects.

It wasn't until a couple of seasons in that a normal episode featured every regular. On a more serious note, Michael O'Hare and his character Jeffrey Sinclair went AWOL after season one, and only appeared in tiny guest appearances, even when it would be appropriate to have him return. After O'Hare's death, it was revealed that the reason O'Hare left was an increasingly severe case of paranoid schizophrenia. O'Hare was offered to seek treatment before season one wrapped, but declined, saying that getting rid of the lead character mid-season one would kill the franchise before it got off the ground and that he would not be responsible for putting the rest of the cast and crew out of work, and chose to grit his teeth and bear it.

The only characters who are likely to be in every episode are Earn, Alfred or Darius, and it's not a guarantee that they'll be in the episode all together. In season 2 this is even more common, with several episodes only starring one of the main characters. The episode "FUBU" takes this to the extreme and contains none of the lead actors, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a> to Earn and Al's childhood with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeShiftedActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeShiftedActor">time shifted actors</a>.

</li><li> Sixes and Eights are the norm, since both actresses are stars and get paid the same regardless of how much they appear on screen. Doral seems to be the go-to "third Cylon" for most of the series, especially the early seasons.
</li><li> Another BSG example: the "webisodes" that were produced during several of the hiatuses primarily focused on supporting/minor characters.

Jennie Garth (Kelly) and Ian Ziering (Steve) miss three, while Brian Austin Green (David) is absent in four.
</li><li> In the reboot, Annie, Silver, and Naomi appear in every episode. Adrianna misses one episode, while Dixon doesn't show up in three. Liam appears in every episode from his introduction towards the end of the first season. Navid tends to miss between one and five episodes per season, while the teacher Ryan missed episodes regularly for his three-season run on the show (appearing in just half of season 3). Ethan appeared in every episode in season 1, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> at the start of season 2.

</li><li> The western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em> theoretically centered on a father and his three sons. However, Pernell Roberts, who played the oldest son Adam, left the show in 1965 and Dan Blocker - the middle son Hoss - died in 1972 (his passing is widely considered a factor in the series' cancellation the following year). Therefore, there are entire seasons in which Adam is "away;" in his absence, various ranch hands, long-lost nephews, and adoptive sons join the family. Hoss is implied to have died offscreen: the father looks at a picture of him while trying to console another grieving character. However, the family does not visibly mourn for Hoss or refer to any of his past adventures, nor do they write to, visit, or talk about Adam.

</li><li> Season 7: Both Xander and Anya do not appear in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E7ConversationsWithDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E7ConversationsWithDeadPeople">Conversations With Dead People</a>", with Anya also missing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E4Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E4Help">Help</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E18DirtyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E18DirtyGirls">Dirty Girls</a>".

From waaay back in the first two episodes?</a>), but they did not pan out. This is the only episode where Xander doesn't appear, leaving only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> (Buffy) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a> (Willow) with perfect attendance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, unlike the parent show, tended to explain any absences among the main cast.
<ul><li> Season 1: Doyle is in the opening of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E10PartingGifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E10PartingGifts">Parting Gifts</a>" despite having died in the previous episode. This was to avoid spoiling that Wesley becomes a regular from this point forward.
</li><li> Season 3: Cordelia misses "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E15Loyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E15Loyalty">Loyalty</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E16SleepTight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E16SleepTight">Sleep Tight</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E17Forgiving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E17Forgiving">Forgiving</a>", as she is on vacation with Groo. From this season, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBoreanaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBoreanaz">David Boreanaz</a> (Angel) appears in every episode.
</li><li> Season 4: Lorne, though technically not a regular at that point, appears in every episode except "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E02GroundState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E02GroundState">Ground State</a>". Also in "Ground State", Connor appears but doesn't speak.
</li><li> Season 5: Wesley did not appear in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E08Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E08Destiny">Destiny</a>", having taken time off due to the events of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E07Lineage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E07Lineage">Lineage</a>". This is because Alexis Denisof was on his honeymoon (with the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>) during filming.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> had this occur during the tumultuous Season Eight due to budgetary constraints. Brian Krause's episode count was drastically slashed, leading to Leo Wyatt appearing in only the first ten episodes and returning for the final two episodes. The void in-between was explained by a convoluted plot where Leo was supposed to die, but (via a deal the sisters make with an Angel of Destiny) is instead simply frozen in a block of ice. Bad as that might've been, Dorian Gregory fared worse: being cut altogether and it being stated that Darryl Morris moved back east with his family. Curiously, this trope is not invoked in the first few episodes of the season where the sisters cast a spell to make themselves and Leo look like different people. Other characters see them that way, but viewers see their true selves. This also happened during the previous seven seasons, though not for the exact same budgetary constraints. During their respective tenures, Cole, Andy, Chris and Dan missed a handful of episodes. Even after being promoted to main cast halfway through Season 2, Leo missed a few episodes over the next five years. Darryl had it even worse, though. He doesn't appear in half the episodes of seasons 3-7. Andy is an interesting example. While Ted King appears in all but one episode of the first season, his character technically does when the Charmed Ones encounter his younger self in the past.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anna is increasingly absent from episodes she has no large role in, culminating in her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in season 3.
</li><li> Due to budget cuts for season 3, the only characters that appear in all episodes are Chuck, Sarah and Casey. So there are episodes where Awesome, Ellie, Morgan, Buymorians and even the special guest star played by Brandon Routh are conspicuously absent. The one that disappeared the most seems to be Big Mike, who would sometimes vanish even when lots of action took place in the Buy More or all the other Buy More people appeared.
</li></ul></li><li> For the first three seasons, every member of the study group appeared in every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>. However, non-study-group series regulars Ken Jeong and (as of season three) Jim Rash were frequently absent, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a> does not appear in season four's "Intro To Knots" and "Heroic Origins." And then, of course, he left the show.
</li><li> The later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> frequently had multiple cast members absent. Technically this started as early in the second season, when Sabrina LeBeauf was added to the opening credits, but it really became noticeable later on. In fact, some recurring characters (not in the opening credits) made more appearances in certain seasons than some regulars did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 7th season had Gil Grissom go on a four-week sabbatical because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamPetersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamPetersen">William Petersen</a> took some time off to do theater. He was "replaced" by Michael Keppler (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LievSchreiber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LievSchreiber">Liev Schreiber</a>) during his absence.
</li><li> There was also "Gum Drops" a bit earlier, which had Grissom absent due to William Petersen attending a funeral, with his absence explained by a throwaway line about him teaching a class at the body farm. That said, many eps have had missing characters without much explanation.
</li><li> Jorja Fox is the Absentee Actor quite a bit, counted as a regular but not appearing in every single ep.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em> is pretty good about avoiding this regarding its three leads. That is until season 3 episode 10 "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Daredevil2015S3E10Karen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Daredevil2015S3E10Karen">Karen</a>", which is the only episode of the show in which Foggy does not appear, which means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox">Charlie Cox</a> (Matt) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll">Deborah Ann Woll</a> (Karen) are the only actors who have been in all 39 episodes.

He is missing from season five's "Four Scary Stories" and "Downtown Crossing" and a few season six episodes. In fact the only credited regular who does appear in every episode is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieHolmes">Katie Holmes</a>, who plays Joey Potter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em> had Bree and Orson abruptly leave for a honeymoon in Switzerland in the middle of Season 3 - apparently months after the two were married - in order to explain away Marcia Cross's maternity leave.
</li><li> Pushed to extremes in season 8 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em> when either Jesse, Amanda or both were absent from nearly every episode.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the 1960s, filming was nearly year-round, so characters  including the Doctor  were often written out of episodes to give the actors a holiday.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E6TheAztecs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E6TheAztecs">"The Aztecs"</a>, Susan has very little to do in the whole story (she's around for the setup, the ending, and a couple of scenes in a seminary) because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleAnnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleAnnFord">Carole Ann Ford</a> was having time off.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth">"The Dalek Invasion of Earth"</a> has one episode where the Doctor is unconscious for the whole time (he only appears briefly at the start, shot from behind).
</li><li> In the one-episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E2MissionToTheUnknown">"Mission to the Unknown"</a>, the Doctor and his companions are completely missing. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a> is still credited, because of the terms of his contract.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E7TheCelestialToymaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E7TheCelestialToymaker">"The Celestial Toymaker"</a> pits the Doctor against a villain who turns him first invisible and intangible, and then mute, except for his hand. This meant he could be portrayed with a spot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADR">ADR</a> and a hand double for the effects shots, and get some much-needed time off.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E2TheTenthPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E2TheTenthPlanet">"The Tenth Planet"</a> has a whole episode where the Doctor is unconscious due to Hartnell being ill. This has the lucky effect of foreshadowing his regeneration at the end of the story.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld">"The Enemy of the World"</a>, both Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling had vacations during the filming of episode 4, so Jamie and Victoria were unmasked as spies and arrested at the end of episode 3.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">Patrick Troughton</a>'s vacation came a few weeks later, and so for all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear">"The Web of Fear"</a> episode 2 the Doctor is missing, presumed [by the characters] dead.
</li><li> During the filming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber">"The Mind Robber"</a>, Frazer Hines took ill and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">replaced by his cousin</a>. Since Hamish Wilson looked nothing like Hines, and because the story had such a surreal nature, Jamie <em>lost his face</em> twice, and the first time it was reconstructed wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> Jamie spends most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase">"The Moonbase"</a> unconscious because the script was written before his last-minute addition to the regular cast and it was hastily altered to fit him in. He gets one good scene about his clan history and is involved in a solid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a> scare but is mostly just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">Distressed Dude</a> and shuffled off to the side while Ben and Polly manage the plot.
</li><li> During the Third Doctor's era, the semi-regular UNIT characters were often left out. The most blatant example is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors">"The Three Doctors"</a>, where, despite a massive attack on UNIT HQ, Captain Yates is nowhere to be seen (and a guest character, Corporal Palmer, takes charge when the Brigadier and Benton are indisposed).
</li><li> The Whomobile isn't in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot">"Robot"</a> because it was personally owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>, and his absence meant the car's absence. The result is that the Doctor is forced to confront a giant robot in Bessie even though his <em>flying</em> car would be a lot more useful for dogfighting a giant robot with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasCourtney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasCourtney">Nicholas Courtney</a> was unavailable due to prior commitments for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion">"The Android Invasion"</a>, and so the Brigadier is replaced with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> with a hilariously identical personality in the final two episodes. It ends up giving the impression that UNIT middle-management is made up of virtually identical Brigadier clones.
</li><li> K9 would frequently be left out of stories in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> era due to lack of anything for him to do (and the cast and crew disliking the character). K9's absence in one story in particular was because the writer of the script, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation">Terry Nation</a> (who was also the creator of the Daleks), didn't want the robot dog to go up against his most famous creations. So K9 was given "laryngitis" for an episode, and was forced to stay behind in the TARDIS. K9 was also left out sometimes because they were filming in a location where K9 prop would have difficulty moving  e.g. a swamp, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry">rock quarry</a> etc. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E5ThePowerOfKroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E5ThePowerOfKroll">"The Power of Kroll"</a>, set mostly in a marsh, K9's voice actor was cast as a side character to give him something to do.
</li><li> Similarly to the Whomobile example above, it's often mocked that the Doctor's shoes turn from boots to brogue shoes upon the Fourth Doctor's regeneration into the Fifth Doctor. This is because the brogues were part of the original costume design, but Tom Baker disliked the look (they were paired with plus-fours and long argyle socks) and bought a pair of his own boots to wear with the outfit instead. No Baker, no boots.
</li><li> Nyssa was left out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda">"Kinda"</a> because originally she wasn't written into it and the writer did not want to change the plot to include her. She does appear briefly in the first and last episodes; her absence from the rest of the story is explained as being due to "mild mental disorientation" which means she needs forty-eight hours of undisturbed rest.
</li><li> This became premeditated for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> eras. To economize on both financial and actor resources, every series after the first was written to have a "Doctor-lite" and a "companion-lite" episode. These could be filmed simultaneously to shorten the overall production schedule.
</li><li> For an example where a character should logically have been there but wasn't, the Doctor's army in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar">"A Good Man Goes to War"</a> was supposed to include Captain Jack Harkness, but John Barrowman was unavailable. Madame Vastra was created to take his place and proved a compelling enough character that she ended up being a minor character in the next couple of series.
</li></ul></li><li> Every character, apart from Carl Winslow, has been absent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> at least once. Laura and Harriette didn't appear in "A-Camping We Will Go". Harriette was also absent from a few Season 9 episodes, due to Jo Marie Payton leaving the show shortly before its cancellation. Estelle and Richie don't appear in most episodes of the final two seasons. Eddie doesn't appear in "Fight the Good Fight," "Par for the Course" and a few other episodes. Steve Urkel is a downplayed example, because while he didn't appear in the show's first 11 episodes, he appeared in every episode since his introduction in the 12th episode "Laura's First Date", due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> status, and was later even added to the cold opening in 4 of the first 11 episodes.
</li><li> This happened with Meredith Baxter-Birney on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em>, but not with Phylicia Rashad on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em>. Because an obstetrician/gynecologist and a lawyer who live in a two-story Manhattan brownstone and already have several children can't possibly afford another kid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>:
<ul><li> For most of Season 3, the cast was split into two groups with alternating episodes focusing on each group with Crichton being the only character that was in both sets of episodes.
</li><li> Season 4 experimented a little with this. For example, after the characters are largely separated at the end of Season 3, the first five episodes focus on the crew coming back together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ron Glass does not appear in one episode.

</li><li> The TV series <em>The Four Just Men</em> starred Dan Dailey, Richard Conte, Jack Hawkins and Vittorio de Sica as four soldiers in WWII who following the war made a pact to fight for truth and justice. Except for the premiere, every episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">concentrates on one of the four</a>, usually with one or more of the others making brief appearances; the only episodes in which all four leads appear are "The Battle of the Bridge" (the first episode) and "The Night of the Precious Stones" (a de Sica episode, with cameos by the other three).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, which ran for 262 episodes over 11 years. Kelsey Grammer (Frasier), David Hyde Pierce (Niles) and John Mahoney (Martin) appeared in every episode.
<ul><li> When Grammer missed taping in order to attend rehab, the main action was taken over by Hyde-Pierce but framing scenes were taped later and added to the episode.
</li><li> Jane Leeves (Daphne) missed a couple in Season 8 due to her pregnancy (Daphne was said to be a fat camp after piling on the weight due to worrying about Niles saw her) and only appeared in a non-speaking cameo in a Season 11 due to her second real life pregnancy.
</li><li> Peri Gilpin (Roz) missed the second and fourth episodes of Season 11 but otherwise appeared in all episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, which may well be the crowning example. All six main characters appear in every single episode. Keep in mind this is a 236 episode show, that ran for <em>ten years</em> and no new cast members were added. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a> moments were worked around, such as Lisa Kudrow's pregnancy which meant she couldn't film in London (Phoebe carried on the plot over the phone), and Matthew Perry's drug addiction (Chandler worked in Tulsa for several episodes, so his scenes could be shot separately).
</li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, no one makes it into every episode, but of particular note is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacHempsteadWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacHempsteadWright">Isaac Hempstead-Wright</a> (Bran) who appears in barely half of the first 50 episodes and is the only surviving member of the original main cast to be completely absent from Season 5.

<ul><li> Taylor is also missing from season one's "Bad News Blair", "School Lies" and "Woman on the Verge", and in the first half of season four she only appears in four episodes - "Gaslit" was her final episode before leaving - although she remains listed in the credits for the entire season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and like Jessica Szohr and Connor Paolo (and several other performers), she comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">Back for the Finale</a></span>.
</li><li> Kelly, meanwhile is the only regular cast member to miss at least one episode of <em>every</em> season, including the premieres of seasons two, three as mentioned above (due to maternity leave and personal issues) and five.
</li></ul></li><li> Matthew Settle (Rufus), on the other hand, is only absent from two episodes in the entire run - season five's "The Fugitives" and season six's "High Infidelity".

ZBZ member (and main character) Rebecca Logan did not appear in the episode. Nor did a few other extra ZBZ members that would've been seen in such a ceremony. (This might have been justified if it excused pledges if other recurring <em>pledge</em> characters weren't also seen in the ceremony.) Also, not surprisingly in a show about fraternities and sororities, there are many episodes without Rusty's non- and anti-Greek roommate Dale.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The actress who played Lexie was absent a lot, having taking time off to spend time with family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She was eventually killed off.</span> Arizona broke up with Callie and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">went to Africa for a bit</a> because of the actress's pregnancy. She came back soon. Meredith had surgery that required her to miss work for weeks because of the actress's pregnancy; she did make appearances, but was always shown in bed. Derek misses six consecutive episodes in season 11; he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dies later in the same season</span>.
</li><li> Even Meredith (the show's titular character) isn't above this; she is only heard in a voiceover in season 13's "You Can Look (But You'd Better Not Touch)" (which is set away from Seattle, and only features Arizona, Bailey, and Jo) and she is absent altogether from the same season's "Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?" the first episode which doesn't feature Meredith in anyway.
</li><li> In later seasons, there are several episodes which only a few characters appear, including the aforementioned episodes. Another prominent example is "How to Save a Life" in season 11, where only Meredith, Bailey, Owen, April, Amelia, and Derek appear; this is the same episode where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Derek dies</span>. Side note: this is the first episode where Alex is completely absent.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to ridiculous levels on the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, where Anson Williams' Potsie was pushed to being a side character and only appeared in <em>six</em> episodes of each of the last two seasons. And yet, he was <em>still</em> credited as a main cast member!

After their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a>, Max, Jerry, and Grover are <em>usually</em> present, but the first two have plenty of non-appearing episodes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5116l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5116l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5116l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of these, Max seems more likely to be missing, and generally has the shortest scenes if it's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode">Lower-Deck Episode</a>; this may have something to due with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka">Masi Oka</a>'s schedule and the fact that he has projects in both California and Japan as well as Hawaii.</span> If one of them is absent, other characters may mention they received information from them (particularly in the case of Max, who as the medical examiner <em>should</em> be present whenever they're dealing with a dead body; it's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">Always Murder</a>, but it's More Often Than Not Murder). Starting with season 5, Danny is absent one out of every five or so episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em> had this occur more than once. Some episodes had Kevin Sorbo not appear in order to give Iolaus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>. During the fourth season, though, health issues sidelined Sorbo for many episodes. He still appeared often with the focus was on other characters, but he doesn't appear at all in "Men in Pink," a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Autolycus</a>/Salmoneus comedic episode. (Iolaus does not appear in this episode either, but Michael Hirst still turns up in a major role. Playing a woman...)
</li><li> Throughout the run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, all the main cast members skipped at least one episode with many of them usually missing one per season; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> was absent from a couple, but skipped fewer than anyone else - Panettiere is both the only cast member to appear in every season one episode and the only <em>original</em> cast member<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6hgrs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6hgrs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6hgrs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Robert Knepper, who was a regular in the final season, also appears in every instalment</span> to be in every season four show. The trope is so prevalent on <em>Heroes</em> that Sendhil Ramamurthy is the only other cast member to take part in all episodes of one season (he narrates all 11 episodes of season two).
<ul><li> In the fall of 2007, it was announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyQuinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyQuinto">Zachary Quinto</a> would be taking a break from the show in order to film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>, which would have meant several episodes without Sylar. However, the writer's strike shut down production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, so there were no episodes for Quinto to be absent from. Volume three averted this by tossing in everyone into every episode, even when they had nothing to do. Played straight by the rest of the show, however.
</li><li> Sylar gaining <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shapeshifting</span> powers may also have been an attempt to avert this, allowing the character to be present even when Quinto was unavailable.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a>: The Series</em>, Duncan MacLeod appears in only half the Season 6 episodes. Actor Adrian Paul may have been losing interest, but Duncan also steps aside so a series of Immortal females "auditioning" for a spin-off could be introduced. Sometimes Duncan only appears in an episode to bed one of the women, an "old friend".
</li><li> Lily was written out of four episodes of the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> to accommodate Alyson Hannigan's maternity leave. The excuse was very clever; she got so upset at a dirty joke that Barney told that she didn't hang out with him. Lampshaded as well since Future!Ted specifically states that she didn't talk to Barney for exactly four weeks when it happened.
</li><li> Sam Puckett in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> during the episode <em>iWon't Cancel The Show</em>. It was created due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy">Jennette McCurdy</a> being in the hospital for an operation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em> gave the minor character Richmond scurvy when Noel Fielding was unavailable for filming due to the tour schedule with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dennis was absent from "The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot" and "Mac Finds His Pride" despite being mentioned as well as the Super Bowl two-parter<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7nfkq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7nfkq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7nfkq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Charlie's Home Alone" and "The Gang Wins the Big Game"</span>, although granted as these two took place while he was in North Dakota; Dee was absent from "Mac's Banging the Waitress", and, after his introduction in the second season, Frank was absent from the aforementioned Season 4 episode as well as "Paddy's Pub: the Worst Bar in Philadelphia". As of 2018, Charlie and Mac are the only members of the Gang to appear in every episode, as they appear on FaceTime in the Ladies Reboot.
</li><li> As far as recurring characters go, Artemis was completely absent from the tenth, twelfth, and fourteenth seasons.
</li><li> A location example: Paddy's Pub doesn't appear in "The Gang Gets Trapped", "The Gang Gets Analyzed", "The Gang Dines Out", "The Gang Beats Boggs" and its reboot, "The Gang Hits the Slopes", both parts of "The Gang Goes to Hell", "The Gang Goes to a Water Park", "Hero or Hate Crime?", or "The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies' Reboot".
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is why Mike Evans relinquished his role of Lionel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJeffersons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJeffersons">The Jeffersons</a></em> after the first season. He'd approached producer Norman Lear with an ultimatum about appearing in more episodes or quitting, and was released from his contract. He was replaced by Damon Evans (no relation), who took over as Lionel for next 3 seasons. After which, he too was let go from the series. Lear rehired Mike Evans prior to season six, but once again left the show after season 8 for the same reasons. This time, his character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnaBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnaBus">sent to work in Japan</a>, not appearing again until Mike Evans reprised the role for two final season episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em> had this happen on occasion, presumably to save on cost. This got strange when Mary, owner of the local bar who did not appear to have a hired maid or waiter, would not show up in her own bar when the episode's focus characters showed up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>, there were many occasions where Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller) might appear on the opening credits and be billed as a cast member, but did not appear in the actual episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLastManOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLastManOnEarth">The Last Man on Earth</a></em>, Phil and the other main survivors don't appear in "Pitch Black".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em>, the Baxter daughters have all missed at least one episode: Kristin in "The Ring", Mandy in "Tanks for the Memories", and Eve in "Papa Bear".
</li><li> Bill Owen, one of the stars of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine">Last of the Summer Wine</a></em>, died after only partially completing three episodes for the 2000 series. In order to use what footage they had of Owen, the producers devised an excuse for his character, Compo, to leave for a while in each of the three episodes - in one, he goes to the betting shop to watch the races, and in another he goes to see his Thursday lady-friend, which becomes plot-relevant in his funeral episodes. Scenes which Owen couldn't complete were then rewritten without him. Once all Owen's footage had been used, the character of Compo died.
</li><li> The episode Robbies Dream Team (you know, the episode with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">We Are</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LazyTown">Number One</a>) is the only episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown">LazyTown</a></em> to not feature Ziggy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em>: Randy Powell, despite being credited in the opening of every episode, actually only appears in six out of fourteen episodes (and is absent from the final episode "Stargate").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> episode "Soul Mates" had the case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> stating she expected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> to be the villain of the problem she and Clark had to solve. It would have been Luthor but John Shea, the actor who portrayed him in that series, wasn't available when the episode was filmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> Only the first season featured any actors that were in every episode. From season 2 on, each actor misses at least <em>one</em> episode, if not more. Sometimes it's explained...but usually not. Worse than Miles's fate being left in the air <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after getting a grenade stuck in his mouth</span> for half the season, Jin holds the record for missing episodes-he's gone in six episodes in a row in season 3, not appearing even after his wife Sun begins to again.
</li><li> Even worse with fan favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Richard Alpert</a>, who appears greatly in season 3 and then drops off the face of the Earth (or the island) in season 4. The reason? Nestor Carbonell became a regular on a competing TV series, <em>Cane</em>. Luckily, the writer's guild strike cancelled <em>Cane</em> and Richard was able to return.
</li><li> Claire Littleton was the first main character to miss an episode and appeared much less often than the other original characters and rarely had much to do when she did. She missed season 5 entirely before returning in season six.
</li><li> Desmond in season 5 beats Jin's; he's prominent in the first half of the season, then only appears in two more episodes...both brief, and both with almost no lines. Irritating, since while the series juggled the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">1977 and 2007</span> Island plotlines rather well, he's just left there. In fact, he's in less episodes than guest stars Richard &amp; Phil and ties with Ilana and Radzinsky (...all four of which received more screen time than him).
</li><li> Henry Ian Cusick is listed in the credits on every episode of season six. He appeared in about 30 seconds of the premiere, reappears in episode ten, and appears in a grand six more episodes, some of them only as his flash-sideways counterpart.
</li><li> Ilana was made a regular, but only appears roughly every other episode until she's unceremoniously <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blown up</span>. One cameo after that, and she vanishes; not even in the finale. This is due to her <em>entire storyline</em> becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a> due to a lack of time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>:
<ul><li> Around the fifth or sixth season, Gary Burghoff had his contract changed to limit his appearances as Radar to 13 episodes of each 24-episode season. During these episodes, Radar was frequently said to be "away on R&amp;R".
</li><li> Everyone in the cast other than Alan Alda was missing for at least a couple of episodes.
</li><li> After Larry Linville (Frank Burns) left the show, the episode following his departure had him going AWOL. To resolve the plot of "what happened to Frank?" Hawkeye receives a call from him and finds out that he was arrested, put in a hospital, and promoted, all without the presence of the actor.
</li></ul></li><li> Not every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> contains the full complement of IMF regulars. In season one's "Elena", the only IMF member involved in the mission is Rollin (although Briggs appears in the first few scenes, he does not directly participate in the mission itself). And in "Action!", Briggs does not appear at all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">thanks to Steven Hill's behind-the-scenes behaviour</a>. In fact, no one appears in every episode of the original version (unlike in the revival, where the full team appears in each show).

<ul><li> Tends to happen to the Dunphy children frome time to time. Luke and Alex missed quite a lot of episodes in the early seasons. Some fans suspect that their respective portrayers, Nolan Gould and Ariel Winter, were subject to child labor laws since they were under fourteen at the time.
</li><li> So far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> by all the adult family members, who have appeared in every episode.
</li><li> Understandably, none of the children appear in "Las Vegas".
</li><li> Manny is the only one of the kids to appear in "Valentine's Day 4: Twisted Sister".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are three episodes ("Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum", "Mr. Monk and the Game Show", and "Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic") where Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher do not make on-screen appearances.
</li><li> There are a few episodes ("Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation", "Mr. Monk Gets Married", "Mr. Monk Is Underwater", among others) where Randy appears but Stottlemeyer does not appear.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the UFO" marks the only episode where Stottlemeyer still appears but Randy is absent.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Game Show" is actually a unique case as it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode made during contract disputes with Bitty Schram, Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford. Because of this, Sharona, Stottlemeyer and Disher do not appear on-screen at all (though Monk's first scene has him speaking on the phone with Sharona), and of the regular cast members, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyShalhoub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyShalhoub">Tony Shalhoub</a> appears. The assistant part ends up going to Monk's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">talkative</a> upstairs neighbor Kevin Dorfman (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JarradPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JarradPaul">Jarrad Paul</a>).

<ul><li> Davy Jones was written out of one episode (Alias Micky Dolenz) in order to attend his sisters wedding in England.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a> was also notably written out of a few episodes in the second season: He was absent due to both a tonsillectomy and the birth of his son, Jonathan.
</li></ul></li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> suffered from this. Before the creative team behind the show got a budget and were moved to cable, they were just a local cable access show and they shot the movie segments live. Thus, if one of the crew had to be out of town for any reason, they'd do something in the host segments to explain it. For example, when Joel had to be in Hollywood for a meeting, his character was explained by the bots to have gone outside the ship to do routine maintenance, which they then quickly forget about. Later, they notice that he's not back yet and look out the window to see a Ken doll in a jumpsuit and space helmet floating outside, suggesting that Joel had lost his grip and was floating away. Similarly, there's an episode where both puppeteers were unavailable and Joel spent the entire episode alone in the theatre.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em>, Lauren Lane had to miss several episodes in the fifth season since she was giving birth. To cover this up, her character C.C. suffered a breakdown and spent those episodes in an asylum.
</li><li> Just before season three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville">Nashville</a></em> began, executive producer Dee Johnson said that a lot of the main cast wouldn't appear in every episode of said season - and indeed Chris Carmack, Will Chase, Oliver Hudson, Eric Close and Lennon &amp; Maisy all miss at least one episode each (and often more than one). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a>'s screen time was already reduced due to her real-life pregnancy, but a lot of material was shot before she took time off to have her baby, meaning "That's The Way Love Goes" is the first episode of the series in which she does not appear at all (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">although her character Juliette is talked to on the phone</a>). Unfortunately, it wouldn't be the last - the following season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">both Juliette and Hayden came down with post-partum depression</a>, leading to the actress having to take medical leave from the show (she only appears in stock footage in "Unguarded Moments"). Aubrey Peeples also had to miss episodes due to filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em>.

The reason in-universe was that Nicky went to a cooking camp.

</li><li> In the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure">Northern Exposure</a></em>, Joel doesn't appear in several episodes before leaving in the final season due to a contract dispute.

<ul><li> It's particularly egregious in the last two seasons, where there are technically four other agents in addition to Don (David, Colby, Liz, and Nikki) but only a few episodes actually feature all four of them; in most episodes, only three agents appear while the fourth is entirely absent. In most cases, the absences are not explained or even noted, although one episode ("12:01 AM") does say that Colby, the absent character of the week for that one, is on a fishing trip.

<ul><li> In season two Carlyle missed three (again) but Ory is absent from <em>10</em> (in fact this trope affected all the regulars except Josh Dallas and Jared S. Gilmore, who appeared in all 22 episodes); ultimately Ory left the series, but the door's open for her return as a guest star.
</li><li> Going into season five the most frequently seen cast member is Jennifer Morrison, who to date has only missed season two's "The Crocodile."

First, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">trapped in amber</a>, while suited. When it was dissolved, found that he could no longer demorph, and remained this way for a <em>very</em> long time. <em>Then</em> he finally demorphed... but was now <em>invisible</em> (his civilian-mode power for that season.)
</li><li> And it happened to him again when his character appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em>.

Continuity wise, Ernie left to do volunteer work in South America. (Lt. Stone's actual quote was, ""Well, his foreign service unit recalled him and he had to suddenly leave. I don't know, something about building a bridge in the Amazon." (On another note, Genelle successfully lost forty pounds and later founded a company called Retail Logistics Solutions, Inc. in Cerritos, California, providing transportation services.)
</li><li> This was the reason for Kendrix's death via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>. Valerie Vernon had to leave the show after being diagnosed with leukemia, and due to overwhelming positive response to this plot device in the previous series (where Zordon sacrificed himself to save the universe) the writers felt they were safe with it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em> did this to John Abuzzi who got his throat cut and disappeared for a while; the actor who portrays him, Peter Stormare, was contractually obliged to go and film some bizarre Volkswagen commercials. He came back 6 episodes later with a haircut.
</li><li> Patrick McGoohan was away filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IceStationZebra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IceStationZebra">Ice Station Zebra</a></em> for much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThePrisonerE13DoNotForsakeMeOhMyDarling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThePrisonerE13DoNotForsakeMeOhMyDarling">Do Not Forsake Me Oh my Darling</a>". This was justified by having the mind of Number 6 being put into a new body. The replacement also allowed them to have Number Six kiss a woman; McGoohan's contract stipulated that he would not appear in a love scene.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba">Reba</a></em>, Kyra only appeared in the first four episodes for the fifth season due to actress Scarlett Pomers struggle with an eating disorder. She returned in the sixth and final season.
</li><li> In Season VIII of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, the crew were suddenly returned to life. This meant Captain Hollister returned (as a regular), as did Lister's friends Selby and Chen (as guest stars). However Olaf Petersen, Lister's best friend and the character most often seen in flashbacks to before the accident, was mentioned twice but never appeared.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> blurs the line between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Written-In Absence</a> in one episode without the title character. The cast doesn't comment on her disappearance, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Roseanne shows up during the credits to inform the audience she was gone due to her pregnancy. But don't worry—she still got paid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em> does better but still the only characters to appear in every episode are Liz, Max and Michael. (Tess appears in every episode of Season 2, the only one where she's a regular.) Maria and Isobel miss an episode each in Season 3 (as does Jesse, who only appears in that season) and Isobel also misses one in Season 2, while Alex, Kyle and Valenti are frequently absent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em>:
<ul><li> Foxx's salary-related departures derailed the show on several occasions, in one instance leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Whitman Mayo's temporary elevation to lead actor</a>.
</li><li> Demond Wilson also missed an occasional episode here and there... and <em>both</em> Foxx and Wilson were absent for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot">The Family Man</a>", the Season Four finale.
</li><li> When Lamont is about to get married in a first-season episode, one guest is noticeably absent from the ceremony - his Aunt Esther. But that's because LaWanda Page (who played Aunt Esther) had yet to be added to the show at that point.
</li></ul></li><li> The main cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> besides Sabrina herself, her aunts, Harvey and Salem, tend to miss a handful of episodes per season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>:
<ul><li> The eighth season did this as a cost-cutting measure, in addition to a smaller-than-usual writing team. Certain main characters went missing, especially Carla; in one instance because she was 'out of town' but in another she was mentioned several times as being there but just didn't appear on screen.
</li><li> Every character is absent for at least one episode in the eighth season. It gets really noticeable when there are whole episodes without JD, the star of the show. One episode only featured his voice, as he talked to Turk and Elliot on the phone. One scene had Turk upset to find that JD has gone to Disneyland without him. Strangely, Turk appears in more episodes than JD, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a>, as a result of his actor being absent a number of times that season. He eventually leaves the show in season 9.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> episode "The Pen", when Jerry and Elaine visit Jerry's parents in Florida, does not have Kramer and George. However, this had nothing to do with actor availability; the show at this point was simply not being written with the mindset that all four characters would appear in every episode. Jason Alexander, who played George, let it be known that he was not happy about being excluded, and that he would quit if he were ever written out of an episode again. Kramer is also absent from "The Chinese Restaurant", but "The Pen" would be the only Costanza-free episode of the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaLouisDreyfus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaLouisDreyfus">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a> isn't in "The Seinfeld Chronicles" (the pilot), which was shot before she was cast, and due to her pregnancy midway through the series is also absent from both parts of "The Trip". In fact, only one cast member appears in every episode— no prizes for guessing who).
</li><li> Due to each generation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> containing a large cast compared to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">limited episode count</a>, each season features at least one or two episodes wherein one or more cast members are absent.
<ul><li> Tony, Michelle and Sid are the only characters to appear in every episode of the first generation.
</li><li> JJ is the only character to appear in every episode of the second generation.
</li><li> Franky, Mini, Liv, and Alo are the only characters to appear in every episode of the third generation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> has tons of this: Clark is the only character to appear in every episode and Lex the only other character to appear in every episode he's credited on (the first 7 seasons plus a guest appearance in Season 10). Whitney, Pete, Lionel, Jason, Jimmy, Oliver, Kara, Tess, Davis and Zod never appeared in every episode of a season despite being on the opening credits at various points (Lionel was a regular on Seasons 2 to 7, the others for between one and three seasons). Chloe misses episodes in Seasons 2 and 4 and hardly appears in Season 10. Lana misses episodes of Seasons 5, 6 and 7. Jonathan misses episodes in Seasons 3, 4 and 5. Martha misses episodes in Seasons 4, 5 and 6. (All three leave the show after that, only managing occasional guest appearances.) Lois doesn't manage a whole season until Season 10, despite being on the show since Season 4 and the opening titles since Season 5.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> tended to do this a lot in its later seasons. Hell, Jack O'Neill did this for almost the entirety of the eighth season.
<ul><li> And then there was one episode "Nemesis", where Daniel Jackson has only a minor part in the beginning, when he was out of action due to appendicitis. The real Michael Shanks had been unable to feature in this episode for the same reason, so they added that first scene in later while he was still recovering.
</li><li> Notably, as of season six, only one main cast member didn't miss an episode: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherJudge">Christopher Judge</a>. He missed his first one that season, but he's still the SG-1 member with the most episodes under his belt.
</li><li> Aside from a brief video appearance, Amanda Tapping was absent for the opening five episodes of Season 9 due to being in the final stages of pregnancy at the time. In order to avoid carrying an all-male cast for that stretch, they reintroduced Claudia Black's guest character, Vala Mal Doran, from Season 8 for those episodes, who eventually also then became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">series regular</a> for Season 10.

The plan coming in that season was for Takei and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterKoenig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterKoenig">Walter Koenig</a> to alternate due to budgetary reasons; Sulu and Chekov rarely appear together until Season 3.

Even in earlier seasons, Jake would often go missing for 4 or 5 episodes at a time. In the end, the ascended extra Morn appeared in more episodes than Jake. <a class="urllink" href="http://memory-alpha.org/">Memory Alpha<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mentions in the notes for several episodes that the original, Jake-centric plot of the episode was scrapped because the actor was unavailable due to his education commitments.

</li><li> Contestants on the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> appear at least on screen at some point in every single episode until they are voted out, however, due to there being many contestants on the show, it is nearly impossible to focus on every single on in an hour-long episode. As a result, some contestants are often relegated to background roles for one or more episodes, having no on-screen interviews (called "confessionals") and are completely irrelevant to the plot of the episode. In extreme cases of this, they are considered by fans to be "invisible" in the episode, indicating that they were all but completely absent from the episode. Often times, contestants are so "invisible" throughout the entire season that their invisibility actually becomes a running gag with fans. Examples include Mary in season 16, Brett in season 19, Kelly S. in season 21, and Rick in season 23.
</li><li> The original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivors">Survivors</a></em> had this throughout Season Two, with various characters "off gathering salt".
</li><li> Due to the terms of his contract, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> (Latka) didn't appear in every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>.

</li><li> William Shatner's <em>TekWar</em> did this, funnily enough, with William Shatner. Shatner played the mysterious Bascom in the original miniseries and appeared in the opening credits for all of the series episodes even with the character not appearing in most of them. Bascom was still referenced several times throughout the show, once being said to be out of the country and unreachable. His absence was even lampshaded in "Skin Deep" when the Police Commissioner complains that he hasn't seen Bascom for months and Sam (Jake's second partner and not present in the miniseries) admits that she's never seen him. Finally, in the episode after "Skin Deep", Bascom made a return appearance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Malcolm Tucker</a> doesn't appear in the first and third episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt">The Thick of It</a></em>'s fourth season, despite him practically being the main character at that point.
</li><li> There was an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch">Third Watch</a></em> where a paramedic appears. Not any of the regular paramedic cast though, none of whom appear in the episode at all.

<ul><li> In season 4, Suzanne Somers was involved in bitter contract negotiations with the show's producers, and was absent for the taping of numerous episodes (citing suspiciously vague health issues). It got to the point where the writers were forced to write two versions of each episode's script: one WITH Chrissy, and one WITHOUT Chrissy, depending on if Suzanne showed up or not. She was consequentially fired, but her role still appeared on the show in a greatly reduced role to burn off her contract, with her character "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">moving to Fresno to take care of her sick aunt</a>" and essentially reduced to a cameo appearance at the end of each episode (with Chrissy shown talking on the telephone with Jack and/or Janet). A new character, Chrissy's cousin Cindy, was brought in to serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> of sorts, Somers' contract ran out, and the character was hardly mentioned again, being permanently replaced with another replacement character: Terry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">That said, to this day Chrissy is still the one most associated with the show.</a>
</li><li> Also, Janet doesn't appear in the Season 3 episode "Stanley's Hotline," leaving Jack as the only character to appear in every episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans">The Thundermans</a></em>, with the six main cast members all appearing in every episode.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9760h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9760h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9760h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Addison Riecke (Nora) was absent from the episode "Can't Hardly Date" because she was busy with the premiere of her movie, "The Beguiled".</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman">Ultraman</a></em>: There is only episode in the entirety of the original series where not all members of Science Patrol appear, and that would be episode 30 "The Phantom Snow Mountain", in which Captain Muramatsu and Fuji are absent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven">Ultraseven</a></em>: Anne does not appear in either episode 11 "Fly to the Mountain of Evil" or episode 13 "The Man from V3", while both Soga and Amagi are absent from episode 19 "Project Blue" (although they are mentioned).

Only their actors had full season contracts. Everyone else was contracted for smaller numbers of episodes because of budget constraints.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em>. Most of the cast appears in every episode with the exceptions of:
<ul><li> Cat doesn't appear in season 1 episodes "Jade Dumps Beck" and "The Wood".
</li><li> Beck is absent in four episodes: "The Birthweek Song" (season 1), "Tori Gets Stuck" (season 2), "Prom Wrecker" (season 2) and "Who Did It to Trina" (season 2).
</li><li> Trina is missing from the most episodes of the cast. She is absent from four season 1 episodes ("Robarazzi", "Beck's Big Break", "The Great Ping-Pong Scam", and "Sleepover at Sikowitz's"), two season 2 episodes ("Beck Falls for Tori" and "Jade Gets Crushed"), and three season 3 episodes ("Opposite Date", "Cell Block" and "One Thousand Berry Balls").
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> does this fairly regularly, with numerous episodes doing a deeper focus on a few characters and everyone else absent or reduced to a cameo. No one's immune; even series lead Andrew Lincoln has missed several episodes.
</li><li> The final seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> rotated the cast on a frequent basis to save on costs, to the point where all the main cast appearing in the credits of an episode (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Leo McGarry's funeral episode</span>) was something of a noteworthy event.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> host Pat Sajak had to miss three weeks of tapings due to emergency intestinal surgery. As a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a> Vanna White hosted in his place. The first two weeks had costumed Disney characters taking Vanna's usual place at the puzzle board, while the third week had Pat's daughter Maggie take that role.
</li><li> A strange example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>. In season 4, Max (Jake T. Austin) has been turned into a girl through magic (and thus played by a female actress) for most of it due to Jake T. Austin having to go work on the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio">Rio</a></em>. Also, David DeLuise would miss a few episodes every season, usually with a reference to Jerry being out of town. Sometimes this was because DeLuise would be directing an episode.
<ul><li> Actually, only Alex (Selena Gomez) and Justin (David Henrie) appeared in every episode during the series, with Theresa (Maria Canals Barrera) missing the most episodes of the cast. However, only Gomez appeared in all the show's episodes as well as both the movie and the aftershow special episode (where Henrie doesn't appear).
</li></ul></li><li> During the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em>, Lucy Lawless had to sit out an episode due to breaking her pelvis in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em> stunt. In an episode completed just before Lucy's injury, Xena's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Callisto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">had swapped minds with Xena</a>. Rather than resolve the body-swap at the end of the episode, the producers allowed Callisto's actress Hudson Leick to continue to play Xena for the following episode, and had her body-swap reversed at the end of that ep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dana Scully's actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a> got pregnant in late season 1, inspiring the famous UFO abduction plot in season 2.
</li><li> Season 5 episodes' absenteeisms are explained because of the filming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture">the first movie</a>.
</li><li> Other reasons included commitments to unrelated projects. Episode "Hungry" of season 7 was the first one narrated from the monster's point of view, and the episode even played with shots of the leads' doubles. The stars were both unavailable, shooting other films.
</li><li> When one of the lead actors directed and/or wrote an episode, they almost invariably focused entirely on their own character, leaving the partner character either barely there or literally absent (e.g. Duchovny's "The Unnatural" or Anderson's "all things").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny">David Duchovny</a> did not want to stay in the production after season 7, so Mulder disappeared for more than half episodes of season 8. He was also absent for whole season 9 and returned only for the series finale.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless">The Young and the Restless</a></em>:
<ul><li> There was a big storyline involving Drucilla learning that her daughter Lily was not fathered by her husband Neil, but her brother-in-law Malcolm whom she mistook for Neil due to being doped up on cough medicine. However, by the time this storyline kicked into high gear, the actor playing Malcolm left the show and they never recast the character.
</li><li> Absenteeism is a fact of life on soaps, especially when you have octogenarian actors who have been on the show for decades. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em> all had/have actors in their late eighties who are kept on minimal contracts as a courtesy, even though they may go years—literally—between appearances.
</li><li> This often happens on the soaps, for a variety of reasons. It is most often due to an actress' maternity leave (particularly if her pregnancy was not written into the show. It can also happen because of contract negotiations (the reason that the aforementioned Drucilla disappeared for a time), or if a late-teens actor is heading off to college, the character is sent off as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a></em>: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLynnSpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLynnSpears">Jamie Lynn Spears</a> was the only cast member to appear in all 65 episodes.

Randy Owen later revealed that Herndon was never "officially" a member of the band to begin with, and was only counted as one by their label due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>.

While Reggie Lusardi later became their touring bassist, Bellmore typically continued to play most of the bass parts in-studio.

Despite that, there are a few episodes where one or the other does not appear. Frank is absent from "She Blinded Me with Seance" and "Rosemary's Baby Shower", having locked himself in their walk-in liquor cabinet in a fit of pique in the former and simply not going along when Sadie visits a friend in the latter.

So the writers became clever, concocted a substance called kryptonite that weakened the Man of Steel, and had a gang of criminals use it to hold the hero hostage. For most of the storyline, the hero didn't need any dialogue, the fans only heard groans coming from the weakened captive, provided by someone else, until the actor recovered and the story was resolved.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> video game developers apparently have forgotten that Squad 8 exists (but then again, they aren't usually given the best developers). It is averted in the Xbox 360 games, though generally not anywhere else.
</li><li> Bill doesn't get any new lines in the <a class="urllink" href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/Crash_Course">Crash Course DLC<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>.

Likewise, in The Passing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bill was dead, so</span> he got no lines there, either. They made darn well sure to avert this for The Sacrifice, however.

Mako and Bolin only get a short cutscene appearance both in the beginning and end of the game. Asami is not given even that, making her the only one of the main cast to remain completely absent.

His role is filled respectively in those games by Wart, Tatanga and Wario. In the NES game, all members of the Koopa Troop are absent as well due to Wart coming along with his own recruited bestiary (the 8-Bits). In a reversal, all Subcon enemies except Bob-Ombs are absent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>, but more of them return in subsequent games (whether mainline or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a>).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, Toad is the only major character in the series that does not appear in any capacity, which is notable as he does appear in all other console <em>Mario</em> platformers (the only other platformer games overall where he doesn't appear are the two <em>Land</em> games).
</li><li> Yoshi's House appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorldPiranhaIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorldPiranhaIsland">Super Mario World: Piranha Island</a></em>, but Yoshi himself doesn't even make an appearance at all.

Somewhat justified as most games are standalone and <em>III</em> is the only numbered game without another game in the same continuity.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> portable game, <em>The Huge Adventure</em>, features every character from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">the third game</a> with the exception of Doctor Nefarious Tropy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> Fake Crash. What makes this notable is that in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2NTranced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2NTranced">Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced</a></em>, Uka Uka decides to get rid of the four other villains and has Tropy replace Cortex because of his absence in the previous game, and as an indirect result, Fake Crash gains plot importance and becomes the third boss.
</li><li> Bebop is nowhere to be found, even separately from Rocksteady, in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheHyperstoneHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheHyperstoneHeist">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Hyperstone Heist</a></em>.

<ul><li> There are no female Nords, Orcs, or Redguards anywhere in the Shivering Isles, since Lynda Carter (voice actress of the female Nords/Orcs) and Gayle Jessup (female Redguards) were apparently unavailable.
</li><li> While the male members of nine of the ten playable races (the exception being the Bretons) all have new dialogue in <em>Knights of the Nine</em>, only the female Imperials have new dialogue. This is unusual, since they share the same voice actress and voice type as the Bretons.
</li><li> Some of the minor plug-ins have to resort to recycling voice clips from pre-existing NPCs when their voice actor is unavailable to record new dialogue. While the developers were sometimes clever enough to re-use lines of dialogue that had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">cut from the main game</a> for the plug-in characters, it especially becomes noticeable in the <em>Vile Lair</em> plug-in, where the Breton merchant Rowley Eardwulf uses the exact same greeting as another Breton named Shady Sam, whose location is very close to the inn where Rowley is staying.

</li></ul></li><li> This happens often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> stories - each member of the enormous cast needs to rotate into focus at least somewhat regularly, and the writers really love to build up heaps of relationships for each character and draw together characters who haven't interacted much yet, so it's pretty common for a character's best friend or beloved teammate to just not show up in a story to make room for someone else. This happens especially often in gacha stories, as only four cards appear for each (and while characters not form the cards can appear, the card characters are meant to be the focus), but it can occur in event stories as well - Autumn Trip revolves around the second years going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip">school trip</a>, but there were two too many characters, so it's mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">off-handedly</a> that Adonis and Kouga weren't able to come due to Undead being busy.

After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII">Mortal Kombat II</a></em>, Daniel Pesina (who played Johnny Cage and all the male ninjas), his brother Carlos Pasina (Raiden), and Katalin Zamiar (the female ninjas) left Midway and sued the company for unpaid royalties after the game was ported to home consoles. As a result, their characters were written out of <em>MK 3</em>. However, fan backlash at their absence led to all the ninja characters returning to the series (albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">different actors</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a></em>, and later <em>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em> which saw the return of all previous characters, again with different actors if the originals were still in litigation.

</li><li> An example involving a convention, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen">Sidemen</a> (then still known as the Ultimate Sidemen) went to EGX 2014 (the event formerly known as Eurogamer Expo), they didn't have their most famous member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI">KSI</a> with them. This was due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">history with the organisers that led to him being banned from future Eurogamer events for life</a>. The following year, they decided not to attend EGX 2015 as they did not want to leave him behind again, and warned their fans to not expect any of them there.

</li></ul></li><li> It's not uncommon for certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter">Achievement Hunter</a> videos not to include the entire main six. However, since late 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GavinFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GavinFree">Gavin Free</a> tends to be absent in most of the videos especially geared towards <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterMinecraftSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterMinecraftSeries">Minecraft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>.

Even then, he is completely silent in the <em>Super Mario World</em> episode "A Little Learning", the second-to-last episode of the series.

Smaller scale threats meant small combinations of different characters - with the ones left out rarely accounted for, but always at least implied to be busy elsewhere. Powerhouses like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, for example, would be conveniently absent when their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> would easily solve the problem.

When the League later expanded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited">Heroes Unlimited</a>, whenever anyone in the Big 7 didn't appear became even more noticeable - with some episodes focusing more on guest characters like the Question or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>. Often justified in Unlimited by having various heroes visible on the view screens in the watch tower, or a character casually mentioning they are helping with X crisis, Y bank robbery, or having their day off. Only three times in Unlimited do we see all of the League fighting in the same place, mass alien invasions, and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">were the fighting the threat was the main focus of the plot</a>.

In addition he only makes non-speaking cameos in "She's the Toad" and "Teed Off" (Rocko screams in the latter, but that's it).
</li><li> <em>Roland and Rattfink</em>: Roland doesn't appear in "A Taste of Money".

<ul><li> There are several episodes where one of the main characters is absent without explanation. A particular example is when Scaredy Bat is mysteriously absent in the episode where Boo-Boo needs to scare someone to become a full-fledged ghost, because of course if he was there the story would be over in a few minutes.
</li><li> Often a character who missed the main story of an episode will appear in one of the sketches before and after that episode. For example, Skull Boy and Scaredy Bat miss the main story in "Bad Hare Day", but star in the sketch right before it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie">Rolie Polie Olie</a></em> did not have the titular protagonist in "Little Bot Zoo".

<ul><li> Tommy doesn't appear in "Cuffed", "The Unfair Pair", "Pickles vs. Pickles" and "Tell-Tale Cell Phone".
</li><li> Chuckie is completely absent from episodes such as "Baby Commercial". Phil, Lil, and Angelica stand out the most, though.
</li><li> Many Season 1 episodes feature Tommy as the only Rugrat to appear in them. By Season 2, the solo-Tommy episodes were greatly reduced, and by Season 3, they were abandoned altogether.
</li><li> For some reason in The Gold Rush, in which Chuckie finds a nickel that the other Rugrats fight over, none of the adults are present throughout the episode, not even Grandpa Lou.
</li><li> In one pair of episodes, Phil and Lil were absent from the A-story and Chuckie and Kimi were absent from the B-story.
</li><li> Dil was absent for 2 episodes in Season 6, 13 episodes in Season 7, and 6 episodes in Seasons 8 and 9.
</li><li> This also applies to spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marge appears but doesn't get a single line in season 4 finale "Krusty Gets Kancelled", although Julie Kavner still gets a credit. Both she and Harry Shearer objected to what they saw as an episode heavily built around guest stars, thus explaining their [characters'] absence.
</li><li> "Four Great Women And A Manicure" has the distinction of being the first (and so far only) Bart-free episode, but it's not the only episode where Bart doesn't speak, as he appears in "My Fare Lady" but doesn't have any lines.
</li><li> Also, "Chief of Hearts" is the first episode in which Lisa has no dialogue (although as with "Krusty Gets Kancelled" above, Yeardley Smith is still credited), leaving Homer the only talking character who appears in all episodes of this show. "Moho House" is the second episode where Lisa has no lines, and just like before, Yeardley Smith is still credited.
</li><li> Maggie also appears in <em>nearly</em> every episode, but <a class="urllink" href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Episodes_in_which_Maggie_Speaks">with exceptions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> including "Lisa's First Word," "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", "Friends and Family", "Coming to Homerica", a dream sequence in "Every Man's Dream", several "Treehouse Of Horror" episodes and the aforementioned "Four Great Women And A Manicure" (speaking with a different voice on almost each occasion), she has no dialogue. However in later seasons, Maggie has been absent from episodes such as "The Mook, The Chef, The Wife And Her Homer", "Stealing First Base", "American History X-cellent", "Flaming Moe", "A Midsummer's Nice Dream", and "Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts", due to being a baby and having little free-range in episodes that focus in secondary characters, locations that are usually exclusive to Homer, Bart, and Lisa, or when no subplots revolving around Marge or the Simpson house are present.

<ul><li> In "The Little Witch," none of the regulars except for the titular character appear; Minimus is the other regular to appear in "The Secret Library: Olaf And The Tale Of Miss Nettle," which outside the first scene, doesn't take place in Enchancia at all.
</li><li> Besides Sofia herself, Amber is the only character to appear in all of the show's movies. They usually show the whole family, but only she and Sofia appear in "The Mystic Isles".

<ul><li> None of the main boys appear at all in "Not Without My Anus", "Pip", "A Million Little Fibers", and "Handicar". There have also been a few episodes were one or some of the boys are absent throughout.
</li><li> Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman don't appear in "More Crap".
</li><li> Kenny didn't appear in "#HappyHolograms". He didn't appear at all in most of the sixth season either, as he "permanently" died in the second-to-last episode of season 5. Being that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">Kenny McCormick</a>, he eventually came back for the very end of the sixth season's final episode.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> tends to revolve its main cast depending on the setting and situation. For example, Squidward doesn't appear in "The Secret Box", but his Easter Island Head house does, and "Just One Bite" has scenes at the Krusty Krab, yet Mr. Krabs doesn't appear. Patrick and Sandy don't appear in most episodes taking place at the Krusty Krab. "The Algae's Always Greener" features alternate-universe SpongeBob, but not the main-universe one. In addition, SpongeBob only gets a non-speaking cameo in "Whale Watching", in which he just laughs without any dialogue.

<ul><li> Interestingly, the episode "The Slaver Weapon" features the only example in any 'canonical' <em>The Original Series</em> work (aside from the original pilot episode) where Captain James T. Kirk does not appear at all. The episode instead focuses entirely on the landing party of Spock, Uhura and Sulu, something which was actually impossible on the live-action <em>Star Trek</em>. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> was the star, and had a contractual guarantee that his character would always be front and center in every episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterKoenig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterKoenig">Walter Koenig</a> (Chekov) was missing from the entire series because they couldn't afford to pay him. Instead, he worked as a writer on the show.
</li><li> An aversion also occurred: originally, <em>only</em> William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, and Majel Barrett were going to be hired as voice actors. But Nimoy balked and said he wouldn't work on the show unless George Takei and Nichelle Nichols were also hired, keenly aware of the ramifications of jettisoning two groundbreaking minority characters. Luckily, Doohan and Barrett were both able to voice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices">far more characters than just Scotty and Nurse Chapel</a>.

</li><li> This is continued in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em>. Garnet and Pearl are absent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E2Guidance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E2Guidance">"Guidance"</a>, Amethyst and Garnet are absent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E4Volleyball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E4Volleyball">"Volleyball"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E12BismuthCasual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E12BismuthCasual">"Bismuth Casual"</a>, Amethyst and Pearl are absent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E13TogetherForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E13TogetherForever">"Together Forever"</a>, and all three are absent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E8WhySoBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E8WhySoBlue">"Why So Blue?"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E14GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E14GrowingPains">"Growing Pains"</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E15MrUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseFutureS1E15MrUniverse">"Mr Universe"</a>. They also have non-speaking cameos in some episodes. Peridot is now part of the main cast in the closing credits, but this is likely because of her line at the end of the show's opening credits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Twins do not appear at all in the "Mr. Grumpy-Pants" episode, as they could not be fit into the plot. Season 2 was a bit more egregious of an example, as they vanished for three episodes in a row. The third season had them missing from the first two episodes and relegated to silent cameos for other early ones, until the crew managed to fit them more into the later part of the season.
</li><li> Lord Stingray, who was hyped as a new main cast member for season 2, vanishes for a while in season 3 (after his role in "Stingstress") up until the last two episodes.
</li><li> The episode "Superfail" features all of the recurring inmates (named and unnamed), with the notable exceptions of Jean and Paul.
</li><li> Jacknife is absent from "The Budding of the Warbuxx", "Stingstress" (that features his female counterpart) and "Last Pack".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>, Babs Bunny doesn't appear in "Test Stress", "Here's Hamton", "Kon Ducki", "Flea For Your Life", or "Toons from the Crypt". Neither her nor Buster appear in "Sepulveda Boulevard" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31r8gl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31r8gl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31r8gl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although Babs' face can be seen on a billboard in the WB studio</span> or "Grandma's Dead".
</li><li> There are a lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> episodes where Thomas does not appear. There are also some episodes where none of the Steam Team appear.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, actors would generally get paid for every three characters, so if they wanted to play six characters, they'd need to be paid an additional amount, so on, so forth. Unfortunately, <em>Transformers</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>. For actors with only one or two regular characters (such as Peter Cullen, Dan Gilvezan, etc.), this wasn't a problem. But for actors with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">a large number of roles</a> (such as Michael Bell, Corey Burton, and <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker">Frank Welker</a>), it meant that many of their characters would either be absent or have no lines. This is somewhat conspicuous in the movie; Michael Bell provides the voices for Scrapper, Swoop, and Junkion, but Bombshell and Prowl have no lines. In addition, another one of his characters (Sideswipe) is absent. Frank Welker has 9 roles (Megatron, Soundwave, Wheelie, Junkion, and Soundwave's five cassettes), and three of his other characters appear without a single word (Skywarp, Sludge, and Mixmaster), two (Mirage and Trailbreaker) are nowhere to be seen. Another one, which is not related to his voice actor being unavailable (since he also voices Shrapnel, who speaks in the movie), is Snarl, who does not appear for most of the movie, only showing up for a few short scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unikitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unikitty">Unikitty!</a></em>: Puppycorn, Dr. Fox, Hawkodile, and Richard are entirely absent from the episode "Stuck Together".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VictorAndHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VictorAndHugo">Victor &amp; Hugo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Count Duckula, Igor and Nanny guest star in the episode 'Treasure Haunt', but Igor is not given any lines due to Jack May not being cast in this series. It's explained away as the butler sulking with his master and 'he's not speaking to you until (we're home)!'. The bunglers pet parrot Interpoll is also silent in his brief appearance in this episode despite David Jason still being present to voice his other characters.
</li><li> Hawkeye Soammes, a character also voiced by Jack May in his appearence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula">Count Duckula</a></em>, guests in several episodes in this series, voiced now by Brian Trueman. As a supporting character though, it's far less noticeable than if one of the other actors had filled in for Igor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries">Visionaries</a></em> has the following examples:
<ul><li> Merklynn is absent from "The Dark Hand of Treachery", "The Price of Freedom" and "Feryl Steps Out".
</li><li> Cryotek, Ectar and Witterquick are absent from "Feryl Steps Out".
</li><li> Though all fifteen members of the regular cast are seen in "The Overthrow of Merklynn", Galadria, Arzon and Feryl only appear in non-speaking roles.
</li><li> Cravex, Darkstorm, Mortdredd, Reekon and Virulina are absent from "Horn of Unicorn, Claw of Dragon", the implication being that they were all affected by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPlague">Magical Plague</a> which sweeps Prysmos in the episode, though this is only confirmed with Darkstorm and Mortdredd.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> has a large number of episodes where either Wander and Sylvia or Hater and Peepers do not appear. These episodes are usually either about Hater and Peepers doing something on their ship or Wander and Sylvia on an adventure irrelevant to Hater.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em>: Ice Bear and Panda don't appear in "Anger Management", "Poppy Rangers", "Ranger Games", "Vacation", and "Lord of the Poppies".
<ul><li> Panda and Grizz are absent in "The Demon".
</li><li> Grizz and Ice Bear don't appear in "Summer Love".
</li><li> "Yuri and the Bear", "Panda 2", and "Family Troubles" all take place before the bears met each other, and so they only feature Ice Bear, Panda, and Grizzly respectively. "Band of Outsiders" takes place right after "Yuri and the Bear," so Grizz and Panda are absent there too.
</li><li> All three of the main bears don't appear in "Kyle" and "El Oso", which focus on Nom Nom and Charlie respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WowWowWubbzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WowWowWubbzy">Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!</a></em>: While Wubbzy has been appearing in all episode since season one, Widget and Walden do not appear in three main segments, all of which are from season two: "Who's That Girl?," "New Kid on the Block," and "What a Card". Some of the minor segments throughout both seasons only contained one of the two while they were both others in a couple of others. Daizy, the character introduced at the start of the second season, appears in every main segment of season two, but is only absent in a few shorts.
</li><li> Jack Spicer appears in all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> episodes except <em>The Return of Master Monk Guan</em> where only Hannibal Roy Bean appears instead.
</li><li> Very noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, which according <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the creators</a>, was usually intentional. The show was insanely expensive to produce, so oftentimes episodes would omit certain members of the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EconomyCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EconomyCast">in order to minimize the number of speaking parts</a>. This became even more apparent when the team expanded into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesUnlimited">Heroes Unlimited</a> roster in the second season.
