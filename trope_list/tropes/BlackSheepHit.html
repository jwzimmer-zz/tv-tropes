For some reason, this happens very often with hard rock/metal bands who hit it big with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong">slow ballad</a>. Or alternatively a hardcore rapper/rap group with a crossover party anthem. For bands with a very niche appeal, the Black Sheep Hit is usually one of the songs "mainstream" enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness">receive play on the radio stations</a>.
</p><p>While having a hit is something most bands strive for, this type of hit can develop into a millstone around their neck because they only wanted to play rock (or metal, or whatever), and now they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting">forever be associated</a> with this song. Often results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a>.
</p><p>While such tracks may well be the one hit of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a>, it need not be — a band with other well-known tracks may still have a Black Sheep Hit if the general public mostly thinks of the misfit song when they hear the band's name. If someone does not like the hit song, they may have no desire to check out the band's other works — and, when finally exposed to it, might be pleasantly surprised to discover that they <em>do</em> like the other songs. Conversely, those who <em>do</em> like the hit song may feel disappointed upon finding out that the rest of the band's songs sound quite different.

<ul><li> Camille Saint-Saëns did not permit "The Carnival of the Animals" to be published during his lifetime, feeling that its frivolity would harm his reputation. (The movement "Tortoises," for instance, consists of the "Can-can" theme from Offenbach's "Orpheus in the Underworld" played absurdly slowly.) Today, it is his best-known work, aside from "Danse Macabre", which was also written more as a joke, but has remained popular for decades.
</li><li> While <em>Carmina Burana</em> was a major turning point in Carl Orff's career and cast a long shadow over his later works, and its framing number "O Fortuna" was indeed the one Orff was inspired to write first, it's <em>much</em> more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">ominous</a> than most of his later vocal and theatrical works, which also tend to be less heavily orchestrated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiacomoPuccini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiacomoPuccini">Giacomo Puccini</a> was not a man to write comic operas, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GianniSchicchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GianniSchicchi">Gianni Schicchi</a></em> is the best known of his three opera collection <em>Il trittico</em>, and <em>O Mio Babbino Caro</em> remains one of the most popular operatic arias in history.
</li><li> For many years after the failure of <em>Un giorno di regno</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a> considered writing a comedy in contrast to his more tragic output, but it wasn't until he settled on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a></em> as a subject that this came to light, and <em>Falstaff</em> has long held its position in the opera house despite being his operatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwanSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwanSong">Swan Song</a>. His Requiem, written in 1874 following the death of Alessandro Manzoni the previous year, also bears honor as one of these since it is one of his few non-operatic works still commonly performed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst">Gustav Holst</a>, despite writing mainly folk-influenced works, including two great suites for military band, is known best for the far more modernistic "Planets" suite.
</li><li> Almost all of Johann Pachelbel's output consists of chorales and fugues, and is regarded as relatively important in the development of the mid-Baroque chorale by musicologists, but very few people nowadays can even <em>name</em> a piece by him <strong>not</strong> titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon">Canon in D</a>, which was the only canon he wrote and gained popularity in the 1970s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel">Maurice Ravel</a>'s "Bolero" consists of two melodic motifs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoleroEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoleroEffect">repeated over and over with increasingly heavier orchestration</a>. Ravel fully recognized how gimmicky this was, describing the piece as "seventeen minutes of orchestration without music," but it became an instant hit and his best-known work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a> is commonly known for two things: his ballets, and the <em>1812 Overture</em>, a (relatively) short tone poem/patriotic military piece featuring heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrchestralBombing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrchestralBombing">Orchestral Bombing</a> and the use of artillery as an instrument.
</li><li> Although it has since fallen out of the repertoire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> initially had one of these with the Meyerbeerian <em>Rienzi</em>. Among his later works, <em>Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</em> is the only comedy among his works most frequently seen.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeEleven">311</a> - "Amber", a slow reggae-ish song compared to their ska-punk rap-rock signature sound.
<ul><li> And their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a>'s "Love Song," too. It was even softer than "Amber" was.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>38 Special</em> is known for their guitar-driven Southern rock. Yet their biggest hit was the synth-driven ballad "Second Chance", released in 1989 and a "comeback" single (it had been several years since they'd had a top 40 hit) to boot.
</li><li> The biggest hit for 4 Runner on a debut album of standard, by-the-numbers upbeat country-pop was the dark and brooding gospel harmonies of "Cain's Blood."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer Aaron Tippin is best known for his patriotic, blue-collar working-man songs and his extremely nasal singing voice. However, his only #1 hits on the country charts do not reflect his typical blue-collar themes at all: "There Ain't Nothin' Wrong with the Radio" (1992) and "Kiss This" (2000) are goofy novelty songs, while "That's as Close as I'll Get to Loving You" (1995) is a smooth ballad about an affair which has Aaron singing in a much higher and less nasal range than usual.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, multiple times, with "Dream On", "Angel", and "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing", the latter being their only number-one hit in the US.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AFI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AFI">AFI</a> was mostly known as a hardcore punk band at the beginning of their career. Their biggest hit, however, was the hard rock song "Miss Murder", which blended in with other rock radio hits of the time.
</li><li> After the Fire were a British power-pop/new-wave band who had their biggest hit with "Der Kommissar", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Falco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Falco">Falco</a> song, that sounded nothing like their regular material. Additionally, it began moving up the charts <em>after</em> the band had broken up. A compilation album was quickly thrown together by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EpicRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EpicRecords">Epic Records</a> to capitalize on the songs popularity in the US market (where none of the bands studio albums had been released).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a> is one of the leading voices in "neo-traditional" country, a style that flourished in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> and up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> which was defined by twangy fiddle-and-steel with a bit more modernized polish. So what was his biggest hit? A duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmyBuffett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmyBuffett">Jimmy Buffett</a> titled "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere", which fit well into Buffett's laid-back beach-party style but was a pretty radical departure for the usually more buttoned-down Alan.
</li><li> Atlanta singer Alicia Bridges got pegged as a "disco diva" when her dance-oriented "I Love the Night Life" became her biggest/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only hit</a>. It was far removed from the bluesy rock &amp; roll that made up the rest of her output.
</li><li> Fans turned on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm">Alien Ant Farm</a> by their hit cover of "Smooth Criminal" were probably confused when they got that track and 12 tracks of emo. Before "Smooth Criminal" hit the radio circuit, AAF were a hyped band in the local Bay Area rock scene, and they had two minor singles that received some radio play. After "Smooth Criminal", it got really hard to market "that band who did that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> song".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKraussAndUnionStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKraussAndUnionStation">Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station</a>, best known for very moody, mellow bluegrass music, had its only big hit with a more mainstream cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley">Keith Whitley</a>'s "When You Say Nothing at All". The song was a hit due mainly to unsolicited airplay from a tribute album, following closely on Krauss' first mainstream hit, a duet vocal on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a>'s "Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart" — which was also a slick, mainstream, mid-90s country ballad, and thus an anomaly in the catalog of Shenandoah, who were usually more energetic, slick honky-tonk influenced country.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThatRemains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThatRemains">All That Remains</a> are known as a heavy-metal band, but "What If I Was Nothing", a #2 hit, is a slow ballad.
</li><li> British duo AlunaGeorge <em>is</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a> act, mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop">synthpop</a>, trip-hop, and UK garage, but their biggest worldwide hit sounds nothing like it. While the original "You Know You Like It" fits their normal material well, the DJ Snake remix that turns it into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMusic">trap</a> is their only song to cross <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond">The Pond</a>.
</li><li> Amy Grant started out as a primarily Christian artist. Then she scored a #1 hit with a mainstream pop song, "Baby Baby".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AphexTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AphexTwin">Aphex Twin</a> and 'Avril 14th'. Most people don't even know it's by him but they know the song.
</li><li> Canadian hair-metal band April Wine is best known for a sweet ballad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">with French lyrics</a> (and a kick-ass guitar solo) called "Just Between You And Me." It was admittedly written as an attempt to bring more female members into their fanbase.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande">Ariana Grande</a> had a massive hit with "Break Free", which is an EDM number that is at complete odds with her normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a>-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RAndB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RAndB">R&amp;B</a> style. This is because it was produced by German DJ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zedd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zedd">Zedd</a> (who was even credited as a feature). For Zedd, however, it's pretty normal sounding.
</li><li> Avantasia is a German power metal project. Their biggest hit? The pop ballad "Lost in Space".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a>'s first number-one hit on the rock charts must have been a hard-rocking metal anthem, right? Wrong, it was actually a slow ballad called "So Far Away".
</li><li> Bachman-Turner Overdrive, a band cited as one of the precursors to heavy metal, hit the US top 10 only once - with the novelty song "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBangles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBangles">The Bangles</a> write the vast majority of their own songs, but of their four best-charting singles, "Manic Monday" was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> (and sounds like it, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">Suspiciously Similar Song</a> vocally to his "1999"), "Walk Like An Egyptian" was a novelty song, "Hazy Shade of Winter" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a> cover, and "Eternal Flame" was the only ballad on <em>Everything</em>. Only their last top 5 hit "In Your Room" sounded like a typical Bangles song.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a> ran into this with "One Week", the entirely goofy white-boy rap which finally shot them to international recognition after years of crafting intelligent, snarky pop-rock. A track off a later album hung a lampshade on the pressure they faced to repeat this success:

</div></li><li> Beabadoobee's song "Coffee", best known through its sample on Powfu's 2020 hit "Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head)", is a lo-fi indie folk song that is very different from her normal sound, which is noisy guitar-driven indie rock similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement">Pavement</a>. This is partly because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, as "Coffee" was the first song Beabadoobee wrote and released.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LicensedToIll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LicensedToIll">Licensed to Ill</a></em> spawned one in the form of "You Gotta (Fight for Your Right) To Party!" Not only was it different for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRap">Punk Rap</a> tune, but most people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">didn't understand the irony of the lyrics</a>. The band hates the song and hasn't played it live for over 20 years.
<ul><li> Their second biggest hit "Sabotage", despite the turntables is clearly a rock song that's very unlike the hip-hop breakbeat output of the rest of the songs on <em>Ill Communication</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> declined to release "Yesterday" as a single in Great Britain for fear it would become one of these. (Let's just say that their producer proposed that it be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> solo work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The world was not ready</a>.) It became the most covered of their songs.
<ul><li> According to <em>Guinness World Records</em>, it's also the most covered of anyone's songs. Ever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver">Revolver</a></em>'s "Eleanor Rigby" is another one, for similar reasons to "Yesterday" though not as severe.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Help">Help!</a>", originally written as a slow, bleak ballad similar to "Yesterday", was retooled into a rock song for similar reasons too.
</li><li> "The Ballad of John and Yoko" has a similar history, being written by John and Paul as a snarky response to the media hype around John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It's credited to the Beatles as a whole, but only John and Paul appear, with John playing both lead and rhythm guitar, and Paul playing bass and drums (it was an 'on the spur of the moment' recording—to make up for it, George and Ringo have the spotlight in George's "Old Brown Shoe" on the B-side of the single, with John and Paul providing little more than backing vocals).
</li></ul></li><li> Bella Morte's "The Rain Within Her Hands" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave">Synthwave</a> song, in contrast to their normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWave">Dark Wave</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal">Industrial Metal</a> output, and became the basis for Andy Deane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject">Solo Side Project</a>, The Rain Within.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BenFoldsFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BenFoldsFive">Ben Folds Five</a> with "Brick": Their signature style usually revolves around uptempo, jazz-influenced songs with witty, irreverent lyrics and fuzz bass. "Brick", meanwhile, was a somber ballad about abortion and the destruction of the relationship between the couple involved.
</li><li> Listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin">Berlin</a>'s best-of collection and you'll notice that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">"Take My Breath Away"</a>, the only song they're really known for, sounds like nothing else on the disc. Berlin's usual style is high-energy synth pop; "Breath" is a rather somber power ballad.
</li><li> The rapper B.G. felt this way about the song "Bling Bling", which spawned a global phenomenon, and made the term a recognized word in the dictionary. Saying that people thought that was what he was all about.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich">Big &amp; Rich</a>'s only Top 40 pop hit and only #1 country airplay hit is "Lost in This Moment", a sensitive and serious wedding ballad which is far removed from their in-your-face hard rock and rap influences (as codified by "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)").
</li><li> "Strange Fruit" was the only protest song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillieHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillieHoliday">Billie Holiday</a> ever recorded. It was the underground hit that marked the turning point in her career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington">Billy Currington</a> is usually known for his relaxed, laid-back drawling country songs, such as "Good Directions" or "People Are Crazy" (his biggest hit overall). However, his career from 2013 onward has been dominated by heavier and more upbeat songs driven by electric guitar, such as "Hey Girl", "Don't It", and "It Don't Hurt Like It Used To".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Billy Idol</a>, "Eyes Without a Face"; a synthpop ballad by a normally punk-rock singer.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Björk</a> is known for "being weird", it's likely that the only song of hers the average person could name is "It's Oh So Quiet" (from her early album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Post" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Post">Post</a></em>) which is (a) nothing like anything else she's ever done, (b) A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover</a> and (c) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">a song she detests now.</a>
<ul><li> The relative popularity of her singles varies geographically, eg. in the UK, where she has the most chart success, "Hyperballad" and "Army of Me" were also top 10 hits. The former allowed her to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> status, and like Radiohead and Beck who did the same thing (after a longer wait in their case), she achieved critical acclaim and established a long career.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s "Changes", a piano-driven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a> from the band that basically created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlindMelon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlindMelon">Blind Melon</a>. A very extreme and passionately-defended case among fandom. "No Rain" is not only a classic example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>, being a sort of sill-sounding upbeat song about paralyzing depression, but was also intended as a kind of parody of the white suburbanite angst that permeated much of the pop music of the 90s. And while the rest of the band's catalog ran the gamut of sound, style and emotion both lyrically and musically, the only thing any of their other material had in common with "No Rain" was Shannon Hoon's distinctive voice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Blondie</a>'s primary musical style is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a>, but their four highest-charting singles in the US were the disco-electronica songs "Heart of Glass" and "Call Me", the hip hop song "Rapture", and a cover of a rocksteady song "The Tide Is High".
<ul><li> New Wave was in its infancy in the late 70's, and punk was just starting to become big in the US. Blondie's hits mark a transition phase in American pop music from disco to New Wave.
</li><li> Also, Blondie had a very flexible style that was tied strongly to both '60s pop and current trends. Thus, the experiments with hip-hop and disco, and the "Tide Is High" cover at a time that ska was experiencing a revival were typically unpredictable moves.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult">Blue Öyster Cult</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AgentsOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AgentsOfFortune">Agents of Fortune</a></em> album featured "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", which became a fluky breakthrough hit for a band whose previous albums are full of weird, abrasive proto-metal songs. Their only other U.S. Top 40 hit was "Burnin' for You", which somehow managed to be even <em>poppier</em> and less representative of their sound than "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a>, "Song 2", especially in America where it's the only song most people know by them. Ironically the song was written to parody American alternative rock at the time. Right down to the indecipherable vocals.
<ul><li> Which isn't as much of a black sheep in the context of that album, which probably changed the course of indie rock music for the next decade.
</li><li> On a lesser note, there's "Girls and Boys", which is downright dance music, but employed in the same mocking tone as "Song 2".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a>'s "One Love" and "Three Little Birds" are happy anomalies in his usually serious rock reggae catalogue, but they are the songs most commonly associated with him. Similarly the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KayaBobMarleyAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KayaBobMarleyAlbum">Kaya</a></em> sold well but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> than the rest of his work. It is said that he released accessible material on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusAlbum">Exodus</a></em> and <em>Kaya</em> so that the public would pay attention to his work for his next album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Survival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Survival">Survival</a></em>, which contained his most political themes to date. However, they ended up changing the public perception of him to that of a carefree hippie rasta rather than someone who was using his music to call for social change.
<ul><li> The same can be said about his international hit song "No Woman No Cry" (the version featured on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveBobMarleyAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveBobMarleyAlbum">his live record</a>), which is a track most people consider romantic. Yet, the original studio version, found on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NattyDread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NattyDread">Natty Dread</a></em>, almost sounds comedic. And despite the fact that Marley did write a lot of love songs: he is also best known for his social commentary, which is overshadowed in "No Woman, No Cry" by its message of love.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger">Bob Seger</a> was first known for his garage rock and then his guitar-driven arena rock. His only #1? "Shakedown", a synth-driven song that was written by him, Harold Faltermeyer, and Keith Forsey for the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsCopII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsCopII">Beverly Hills Cop II</a></em>.
<ul><li> Another one of his big hits, "Shame on the Moon", managed to get enough airplay at country radio to make #15 on the country music charts. It was even written by critically acclaimed country singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell. It, too, is a (less blatant) departure from his usual sound.
</li></ul></li><li> While Bobby McFerrin is still respected as a jazz vocalist, he's not likely to ever live down "Don't Worry, Be Happy".
</li><li> The BoDeans's biggest hit is "Closer to Free", a jangly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> song that sounds nothing else like the rootsy folk-rock they normally play.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneThugsNHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneThugsNHarmony">Bone Thugs-n-Harmony</a>: The Ghetto Cowboy Song, and to a lesser extent "Tha Crossroads". The latter making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> in some fans eyes. What really made tha crossroads standout on the <em>E.1999</em> album was the fact it was a somber rap ballad amidst a album that was filled with occult mysticism, and bloodthirsty gangsta rap. The original mix was closer in tone to the Gothic-sounding album. The former was actually a remix.
</li><li> Bonnie Tyler is primarily a pop-rock artist, but her first international hit was the country rock styled "It's a Heartache". Due to the success of "It's a Heartache" on country radio stations at the time (1978), this made people originally think she was a country singer.
</li><li> The Boomtown Rats was a punk rock/new wave band, but their one US hit was <em>I Don't Like Mondays</em>, a much slower ballad.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston">Boston</a>, who were stadium rockers, rarely recorded ballad. However, one of their few, "Amanda", became their only #1 hit.
</li><li> A rare example where the black sheep hit was their first: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen">Boyz II Men</a> are known for the romantic ballads and soulful harmonies. Naturally, their first hit "Motownphilly" was an up-tempo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJackSwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJackSwing">New Jack Swing</a> dance number.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley">Brad Paisley</a>:
<ul><li> He usually records tongue-in-cheek novelty numbers, and on the rare occasion that he <em>does</em> a ballad, it's still got an undercurrent of humor mixed with introspection ("Letter to Me") or sympathy and praise for the opposite sex ("Waitin' on a Woman"). Not so with "Then", a very pop-sounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a> love ballad that sounds nearly nothing like the rest of his career as far as melody or lyrics.
</li><li> "Whiskey Lullaby" (featuring the aforementioned Alison Krauss) is a very soft, somber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>, which is unusual for Paisley's standards, but not so much for Krauss'.
</li><li> Another example of a black sheep hit from him is "Remind Me", a duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood">Carrie Underwood</a>, which is his highest charting song on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Like "Then", it's a poppy ballad, and its subject matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks">Dead Sparks</a> is an aberration to both artists' catalogs.
</li></ul></li><li> The two biggest hits for the British band Breathe in America were the ballads "How Can I Fall" and "Hands to Heaven". The rest of their material isn't exactly <em>heavy</em> by any means, but does have a much more upbeat and dance-y <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophistiPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophistiPop">Sophisti-Pop</a> quality to it than those two songs.
</li><li> Two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>'s biggest hits were outside their honky-tonk roots: a Latin-flavored cover of B.W. Stevenson's "My Maria", and the bombastic, electric guitar-heavy, rock-influenced "Ain't Nothing 'Bout You". These are also among the few singles of their career that neither member of the duo wrote.
<ul><li> While most of the songs have Ronnie Dunn doing lead vocals, and his voice is what people think about when they think of Brooks &amp; Dunn, there are a few songs (most notably "Rock My World (Little Country Girl)" and "Lost and Found") that feature Kix Brooks doing lead vocals. This can be quite confusing if you're a casual fan.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS">BTS</a>' first and so far only #1 hit in the US, "Dynamite", is their only fully English single<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pftf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0pftf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pftf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not counting songs where they appear as featured artists</span>, and it's the only one where no member has writing credits (rap line included), so while its sound is on par with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a> musical approach, it doesn't have BTS' usual lyricism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call Backs</a> or ties to larger themes. It's also their only single that's not part of an album (they usually release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Albums</a>). Thematically, it only really fits on a meta sense, with the stated intent to bring joy to listeners during the COVID-19 pandemic being in line with the way much of their work seeks to bring healing and comfort (albeit through lyrics more elaborate and personal than in "Dynamite").
<ul><li> According to the members, they liked the demo sent to them so much that they wanted to capture that feeling as much as possible, leaving the original English lyrics untouched (though not for lack of trying - they tried to add Korean lyrics and rap but it didn't work). This decision, however, also helped greatly in gaining US radio support (one of the main factors in Billboard Hot100 charting), as a major reason previous BTS singles had lackluster radioplay in the US <a class="urllink" href="https://nowthisnews.com/pop/radio-why-wont-you-play-bts">was the fear that non-English songs would lead listeners to tune out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ButtholeSurfers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ButtholeSurfers">Butthole Surfers</a>' number one hit "Pepper" is a style parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beck">Beck</a> with serious lyrics, and not really representative of their output, which is generally darker, more humorous, and more experimental.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris">Calvin Harris</a> did all the singing himself on his first two albums, but since he broke into the mainstream almost every song features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Special Guest</a> doing the singing rather than him. There are two exceptions, namely "Feel So Close" from <em>18 Months</em> and "Summer" from <em>Motion</em>, two massive hits sung entirely by him (the latter of which is seen as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>). Almost every other song that doesn't feature a guest vocalist is an instrumental.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainSensible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainSensible">Captain Sensible</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDamned">The Damned</a> had a solo hit with a cover version of "Happy Talk" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SouthPacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SouthPacific">South Pacific</a>. Allegedly the band's usual punk rock style came as a shock to some old ladies who later bought tickets to one of their shows expecting an evening of similar ballads.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCardigans">The Cardigans</a>' "Lovefool" is much poppier and upbeat than the rest of their work (but its lyrics are just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">dark and ironic</a> as their other songs).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarlySimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarlySimon">Carly Simon</a>'s "You're So Vain" is not her only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>, but it's probably her least subtle. While it's far from her only hit, it's her only #1 (in Australia and North America), her best known song and is more rock-oriented than most of her hits.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUIElvJRyNU">original music video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> made the intent of the song very clear: needless to say, they were forced to shoot a new one for American audiences.
</li></ul></li><li> At a time when most of his popular songs were guitar-influenced, Cat Stevens had a Top 10 hit with his cover/arrangement of "Morning Has Broken" from <em>Teaser and the Firecat</em>, contrasting the calm guitar of Stevens and the flamboyant piano of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Rick Wakeman</a>. His next album, <em>Catch Bull at Four</em>, had no singles at all, but the pop-influenced "Sitting" and "Can't Keep It In" propelled the album to #1.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChainsmokers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChainsmokers">The Chainsmokers</a>:
<ul><li> Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> was "#SELFIE", a novelty dance song about taking selfies. It sounds nothing like most of their more "normal" style of EDM, and it was thought that it would doom them to one-hit wonder status because of it. They managed to escape it by reinventing themselves as a more serious act, making this a textbook example of one escaping the looming shadow of a black sheep hit.
</li><li> They later had another one with "Closer", to a lesser extent. It was the first single to feature a member of the duo, specifically Andrew Taggert, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone">singing</a> as opposed to being handled entirely by a guest. This duet style song done with featured artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Halsey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Halsey">Halsey</a> became their first song to hit #1 in the United States.
</li></ul></li><li> "Rockney" duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChasAndDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChasAndDave">Chas &amp; Dave</a>, best known for their humorous and fast-paced songs, had a hit with their maudlin ballad "Ain't No Pleasin' You".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX">Charli XCX</a> finally had a hit with her theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em>, "Boom Clap", after 8 non-charting singles and only being known for features (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IconaPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IconaPop">Icona Pop</a>'s "I Love It" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyAzalea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyAzalea">Iggy Azalea</a>'s "Fancy"). "Boom Clap" is a clean, upbeat, energetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">silly love song</a> that could safely be played on any radio station or event with children involved (indeed, the song is very popular with kids). Anyone who looked up her <em>other</em> material however, might have been in for a shock to discover how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">sarcastic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">raun</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">chy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">swear-filled</a> her songs normally are. This is most likely why she never had another major solo hit afterwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a>'s "The Flame". Best known for their high energy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> numbers, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced to record this ballad by their label</a> because their previous two albums had been duds. Guitarist Rick Nielsen hated the song so much that when its demo was first played for the band, he pulled the cassette out of the machine and destroyed it by grinding it with his boot heel. Eventually they felt obligated to record it and it became their only number 1 single. When they play it live, they often mock the song and the fanbase they picked up from it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gmry');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1gmry" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gmry');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The band was offered the choice of either recording "The Flame" or a Diane Warren song called "Look Away", and they picked the ballad they hated the least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a> took "Look Away" to the top of the Hot 100 six months after "The Flame" did the same.</span>
</li><li> Cherry Poppin' Daddies recorded music in practically every genre, but their main one was primarily ska. Yet they are labeled as a swing band, thanks to "Zoot Suit Riot". To be fair, "Zoot Suit Riot" was also the title track to a compilation specifically meant to highlight their swing material, which then became their most commercially successful album. Even before "Zoot Suit Riot" became a hit, the swing revival caused them to pick up a new fanbase, so their manager suggested they put together a compilation featuring just the swing songs from their previous albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a>'s "If You Leave Me Now" was this at the time of its release. It was almost left off <em>Chicago X</em> for this reason. After the album was released, band member Walter Parazaider heard the song on the radio... and didn't know it was his own band's work. Needless to say, the success of the song led to a big shift in the band's style. Thirty-five years later, keyboardist Robert Lamm has been known to jokingly introduce it at concerts as "The song that ruined our career."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino">Childish Gambino</a> started off as and has always been primarily a rapper. However, his album <em>Awaken, My Love!</em> saw him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery">veer off into funk</a>. That album has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7eSUU9oy8">''Redbone''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was his first big hit on the charts.
</li><li> Everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisDeBurgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisDeBurgh">Chris de Burgh</a> ever did falls into three categories: 1. Michael Bolton-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> beltfests ("Don't Pay the Ferryman"), 2. Gentle, melodic folk ballads ("This Song for You"), and 3. narratives ("Patricia the Stripper"). One time... <em>one time</em>... he did a mushy love song, "Lady in Red". Which he specifically did as a tribute to his wife. Guess which one gets the most airplay?
</li><li> Chris Rea is best known as a blues-rock artist and for his slide guitar playing, but his biggest American hit was his debut single "Fool (If You Think It's Over)", a keyboard-based soft rock song which is also the only song he's released that he doesn't play guitar on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry">Chuck Berry</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> legend whose songs such as "Johnny B. Goode" and "Roll Over Beethoven" influenced entire generations of rock artists, scored several hits on the R&amp;B charts but only one #1 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 during his multi-decade career: the silly novelty ditty "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">My Ding-a-Ling</a>", which he didn't even write.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba">Chumbawamba</a> got known as an anarchistic punk band, but the only song of theirs most people could probably name is the pop number "Tubthumping". Unfortunately, due to "anarchist punk" being virtually unknown in mainstream, and this tag being used in conjunction with every mention of the band, "Tubthumping" has become a representation of "anarchist punk".
<ul><li> This was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, putting out a rollicking crowd-pleaser to attract people to their more serious work.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a>'s biggest hits are examples of this. Although music critics know them as revolutionaries in punk rock music (who later played reggae, jazz, world music and just about anything they could think of), most normal people know them for their pop hits: the title track and "Train in Vain" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling">London Calling</a></em> and "Rock the Casbah" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go" from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CombatRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CombatRock">Combat Rock</a></em>.
<ul><li> "Train in Vain" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" are especially notable, since they were not sung by frontman Joe Strummer, but rather by guitarist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone">and occasional vocalist</a> Mick Jones.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> was quite possibly the most popular rock band in the world during the 00s, rivaled only by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a> for the title. They're known for playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a>, and later incorporating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a> into their sound. Their biggest hit? "Viva la Vida", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaroquePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaroquePop">Baroque Pop</a> song with elements of neither one. It was their only #1 pop hit in the US.
</li><li> Count Basie, leader of an influential jazz big band, had his only #1 hit in 1947 with "Open the Door, Richard", a comedy skit with the occasional chanted refrain and not much jazz outside of Basie's piano accompaniment. A contemporary review lamented that "musically, this is Basie's worst record."
</li><li> Coven was a hard rock band in the late '60s whose use of Satanic imagery predated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> by nearly a year (they even had a song called "Black Sabbath" and a bassist named Oz Osbourne), and their debut album concludes with a recording of a Satanic mass performed by the group. Their biggest hit? "One Tin Soldier", a folksy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> recorded for the soundtrack to <em>Billy Jack</em>.
<ul><li> Thus demonstrating why Satanic hard rock groups shouldn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover songs</a> by Canadian folk-pop groups.
</li></ul></li><li> "Dance with the Devil" was Cozy Powell's first and biggest solo hit. Unfortunately, he didn't really mean it: "I only cut 'Dance with the Devil' for a laugh, but then it escalated until I felt I was losing credibility..." It led to him quitting music and going into motor racing full time for a few months, after which he was persuaded to join Strange Brew and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCranberries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCranberries">The Cranberries</a>' "Zombie" to an extent - they've had hits that were just as big and were more representative of their signature style, but it's one of their most famous songs and also the only heavy, grunge-influenced thing they've ever done. They specifically went for a darker, more aggressive sound in this case because they thought it would fit with the overtly anti-war lyrics. It's sort of an inverse of the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong">Surprisingly Gentle Song</a> example.
<ul><li> Even more so with "Salvation", an uptempo pop-punk number.
</li></ul></li><li> Crazy Town's entire discography consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">macho</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal">Rap Metal</a>. Their only #1 hit and by extension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">their only Hot 100 entry</a>? "Butterfly". A funky pop-rap love ballad that sounds absolutely nothing like anything else they have ever done.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a>'s "Friday I'm in Love" is an incredibly silly love song, contrasting their usual darker style.
<ul><li> The uptempo pop-styled "Just Like Heaven" is in great contrast to their gothic style, sounding more reminiscent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a>'s guitar-driven material from around the same period.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaYoopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaYoopers">Da Yoopers</a>' two best-known songs are "Rusty Chevrolet" and "Second Week of Deer Camp". The former is an example because it's one of the only parody songs they've ever done (specifically, of "Jingle Bells"), while the latter is far more traditional and folk sounding (the only instruments on it are an accordion and gutbucket bass).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk">Daft Punk</a>'s <em>Random Access Memories</em> takes it to another level by applying it on an album-scale. They're a massively influential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a> duo, so naturally their biggest hit album would be a '70s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">Disco</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Funk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Funk">Funk</a> throwback to the sounds that originated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>.
</li><li> Songwriter Dave Bassett is best known for writing hard rock songs (including the aforementioned "Second Chance" for Shinedown), but the biggest hit of his career? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RachelPlatten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RachelPlatten">Rachel Platten</a>'s "Fight Song", which is a purely Adult Contemporary ballad. He had another major hit only a few months later writing Elle King's Grammy-nominated "Ex's &amp; Oh's". While it's the closest pop radio has seen to a "hard rock" hit since "Second Chance" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingsOfLeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingsOfLeon">Kings of Leon</a>'s "Use Somebody", it's still practically pop compared to most other Bassett tunes. That being said, they're both typical songs for Platten and King. Those three songs were Bassett's only mainstream hits, with his only other top 40 entry being a song he wrote for the first winner of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>, and none of the artists ever had another pop hit aside from Platten, and even then, with a song that wasn't written by Bassett and barely scraped the top 40 for a week or two. Shinedown and King both maxed out at #42, the latter only via a featured spot on a song by country singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DierksBentley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DierksBentley">Dierks Bentley</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe">David Allan Coe</a> was best known for his rebellious outlaw style, yet his biggest hit was the sensitive ballad "Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile".
</li><li> To some extent, two of the best known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadMilkmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadMilkmen">Dead Milkmen</a> songs are these: "Punk Rock Girl" doesn't differ that much from their usual style musically, but the lyrical humor is a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> than usual, and Joe Jack Talcum sings it instead of their regular vocalist Rodney Anonymous. Meanwhile, "You'll Dance to Anything" does have Rodney on lead vocals and is more representative of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>-laden humor, but since it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">NewWave</a>, it's based around deliberately repetitive synthesizers and drum machines instead of their usual full-band sound.
</li><li> Del Amitri's "Roll to Me" was added to <em>Twisted</em> as an afterthought, and it's now the only song of theirs that many people know. The rest of <em>Twisted</em> is a bit harder and while not inaccessible, isn't nearly as perky as "Roll to Me".
</li><li> "I Could Sing of Your Love Forever" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Delirious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Delirious">Delirious</a> might have been their most famous song in America. It was mellower than their other hits and was also more of an old-timey praise chorus song than a contemporary worship (a genre they helped popularize). Martin Smith didn't think it was one of his best songs, either. They later released a rocked-up version of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiamondRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiamondRio">Diamond Rio</a> had their biggest crossover with "One More Day", a lush pop ballad that stood at complete odds to their usual twangy country-rock.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits">Dire Straits</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrothersInArms">"Money for Nothing"</a>; a fast-paced, high-energy pop rock song from a band typically known for roots and blues rock. Even in the context of its parent album, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
</li><li> In a bizarre twist, this happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a> in just the opposite manner: "Down with the Sickness" remains one of their heavier and most well-known songs, which has gone to undermine their slower, more melodic works in later albums. 11 million records, five number 1 albums and a Grammy nomination later, they're still seen in the public eye as that band that makes staccato monkey noises. "Down with the Sickness" was typical of Disturbed's style at the time. The slower, melodic, stuff came later as the band got more mature.
<ul><li> Happened in a much more typical fashion with their orchestral cover of the 60's folk classic "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel">The Sound of Silence</a>," which charted higher than anything they've ever done (becoming their first multi-platinum song) and saw them gain exposure on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conan">Conan</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>. Besides one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">electronic rock ballad</a>, the album it came from is one of their heaviest yet.
</li></ul></li><li> One reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean">Don McLean</a>'s successful career as a singer-songwriter was somewhat limited was that audiences and radio programmers expected his other songs to be similar to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanPie">American Pie</a>" and were disappointed when they weren't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer">Donna Summer</a> was most famous as the Queen of Disco, but then "I Feel Love", her 1977 collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiorgioMoroder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiorgioMoroder">Giorgio Moroder</a>, was almost entirely produced on a Moog Modular 3P synthesizer, and may be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItaloDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItaloDisco">Italo Disco</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicDanceMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicDanceMusic">Electronic Dance Music</a>, not to mention her singing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">head voice</a> as opposed to her normal chest register.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan">Donovan</a>'s lone #1 hit was the totally psychedelic "Sunshine Superman", following a long chain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Dylanesque</a> folk rock. Eventually he switched to psychedelia because of this.
</li><li> 1990s country star Doug Stone was usually known for being a balladeer, usually with an emphasis on heartbreak or sorrow (as exemplified by his debut single "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)"). Two of his biggest hits ("A Jukebox with a Country Song" and "Why Didn't I Think of That") were far more uptempo, but not completely outside his comfort zone thematically  the first is about him seeking a place to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">drown his sorrows</a> after a fight with the Mrs., while the latter is him regretting that his girl is now with someone else. However, "In a Different Light" stands out as a romantic love song about a relationship with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeRomance">office worker</a>. "Addicted to a Dollar" and "Born in the Dark" also stand out for having a much harder country-rock edge than the rest of his career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a> wrote "Pull Me Under" almost as an afterthought to the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImagesAndWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImagesAndWords">Images and Words</a></em> because it was thought the album (which was released in 1992 but mostly written in 1989) needed a more straight-forward heavy song to balance out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking">Epic Rocking</a> and the ballads. The song went on to be a surprise # 10 rock radio chart hit and popular MTV video. They've also expressed irritation over the immense and enduring popularity of "Metropolis Pt. 1" (although this was not a radio hit) to the point where many fans wanted to hear it at <em>every</em> show. Mike Portnoy once asked, "Don't you guys ever get tired of this fucking song?" and John Petrucci said the band could "play it in [their] sleep."
</li><li> Dusty Springfield kicked off her solo career in 1963 with "I Only Want to Be with You", a heavy song in her rather light career. Somehow, it shot to #4 in her native UK but missed the Top 10 in the US.
</li><li> While calling any of their songs a "hit" would be stretching it, the cult classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal">Death Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity">Edge of Sanity</a> is best known for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwhzmUismio">"Black Tears"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a catchy punk/alternative rock-influenced song which has been covered by numerous other metal bands including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeavenShallBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeavenShallBurn">Heaven Shall Burn</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EternalTearsOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EternalTearsOfSorrow">Eternal Tears Of Sorrow</a>. Even with singer Dan Swanö's new band Nightingale, it remains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> that gets played at most live shows and has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipationSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipationSong">Audience Participation Song</a>.
</li><li> The Elastik Band were a pretty obscure, short-lived band in the 60's, but later on their bizarre, politically incorrect psychedelic blues-rock single "Spazz" became a cult favorite when it showed up on the compilation <em>Nuggets</em>. Some time later, a compilation of their complete recordings came out, and it turned out they were otherwise a gentle folk-rock band who generally had more in common with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a> or The Left Banke than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaptainBeefheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaptainBeefheart">Captain Beefheart</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a>'s trademark sound of symphonic rock brought them fame... but their biggest hit in the US was the string-less "Don't Bring Me Down".
<ul><li> They also had two other top 20 hits in the U.S. - "Hold on Tight" and "Calling America" - which lacked strings (although it must be noted that strings had been largely abandoned by that point in their career).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EllieGoulding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EllieGoulding">Ellie Goulding</a>:
<ul><li> As a common example of covers being black sheep hits, one of her biggest hits is "Your Song", an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> cover. It is a lot more piano based than her other songs, which are basically electro-pop with folk elements.
</li><li> Also, "Burn" was the biggest hit off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Halcyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Halcyon">Halcyon</a> Days</em>. It's the most straightforward pop song on the album, being a light-hearted song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, while rest of the album consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong">obsession songs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance">destructive romances</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> sound.
</li><li> "Love Me Like You Do" became her third Top 20 hit and second Top 10, yet it's completely different from what she normally does for a couple of reasons. It was made for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em> soundtrack, and as such is heavily about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a> (a topic she hasn't even hinted at before), and Goulding had absolutely no involvement in the songwriting process (a far cry from her normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop">Indie Pop</a> DIY style). It is in her signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop">synthpop</a> style, however. It's just that the subject matter and production is completely different from what she normally does. It was also unusual in that its success was fueled by digital downloads and streaming whereas most of her previous hits were predominantly radio hits (it literally held the World record for the most streamed song in a single week — until Wiz Khalifa broke it with "See You Again").
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>'s "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting" is one of his best-known songs, but is <em>much</em> harder than his other material. An inversion of the usual scenario. Elton also never thought "Bennie and the Jets" was commercial enough to be a hit. It not only <em>did</em> become a hit, but topped the <em>R&amp;B</em> charts. Elton was one of the first white performers to play on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoulTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoulTrain">Soul Train</a></em>.
</li><li> "Everyday I Write The Book" is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>'s biggest hits, but he's said he's not that big a fan of the song, admitting he deliberately wrote it to be very poppy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> pretty much ran the gamut from loud rockers and jumpy, jazzy tunes to soft ballads and bluesy melodies. Shortly before his entry into the army, however, he recorded the Dixieland-based "Hard Headed Woman", one of the more unusual of his numerous chart-toppers, for the film <em>King Creole</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>'s "Lucky Man". ELP's first album did not have enough material to meet contract obligations, and thus Greg Lake decided to record a song he had written when he was twelve. It is very atypical of the band in that it focused mainly on acoustic guitar and singing instead of keyboards and instrumentals. A song meant to be a filler turned out to be a successful hit, reaching number 48 in the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Lake would write and play acoustic guitar ballads on later albums, such as "From The Beginning", "Still... You Turn Me On" and "C'est La Vie", some of which were Black Sheep Hits in their own right.
</li><li> Emiliana Torrini's biggest hit "Jungle Drum" is a textbook example of this. Being very upbeat and rather poppy it was a big hit in Europe. And also completely different from her usual rather quiet, dark and bittersweet songs. Torrini herself was rather surprised at the success of the song since it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">barely even made it to the album.</a>
</li><li> While the majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a>'s music deals with dark and brooding topics, usually about his personal life, he also has a habit of always releasing at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">"joke" song</a> on each album that mocks pop culture and celebrity gossip. Because of the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">lighthearted</a> tones of these tracks, they often serve as the lead singles to his albums and, as a result, are some of his more popular and well-known songs:
<ul><li> "My Name Is" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSlimShadyLP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSlimShadyLP">The Slim Shady LP</a></em>
</li><li> "The Real Slim Shady" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarshallMathersLP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarshallMathersLP">The Marshall Mathers LP</a></em>
</li><li> "Without Me" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEminemShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEminemShow">The Eminem Show</a></em>
</li><li> "Just Lose It" and "Ass Like That" from <em>Encore</em>
</li><li> "We Made You" from <em>Relapse</em>
</li><li> Averted finally on <em>Recovery</em>, which consists entirely of sober and serious subject matter; the untitled hidden track is the closest thing to a joke song on there.
</li><li> "Berzerk" from <em>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</em>.
</li><li> "Framed" from <em>Revival</em>.
</li><li> Though disimilar from other examples, "Venom" from <em>Kamikaze</em> is the only non-diss track on the album, and also got much more reach from being the theme to, well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018">Venom</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eve6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eve6">Eve 6</a> followed a similar path. The hit from their debut self-titled album, "Inside Out", was much lighter and more pop-flavored than the harder-edged post-grunge style of the rest of the album. The following album <em>Horrorscope</em> was filled with mellower, poppier songs. Among several songs from that album to hit the charts was one that took them even further from their roots - the ballad "Here's to the Night", making it, arguably, a black sheep among black sheep (or maybe a black goat).
</li><li> Everything but the Girl's greatest hit was Todd Terry's dance remix of "Missing", which influenced them to undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> from their prior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophistiPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophistiPop">Sophisti-Pop</a>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">they never achieved any further US pop hits</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Extreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Extreme">Extreme</a> was known for poppy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> with clever lyrics and remarkably intricate and speedy guitar work by Nuno Bettencourt (the Beethoven guitar riff from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em> came from their song "Play With Me" and a regular feature in their concerts was Nuno's rendition of "Flight of the Bumblebee"... take THAT, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce">DragonForce</a>!). The only songs by them that get any airplay anymore? The ballad "More Than Words" and the folksy "Hole Hearted", both slower acoustic songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a> had one with "Epic", their only Top 40 hit. Of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">countless genres</a> they've done over their long career, this was one of only a handful of songs that featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal">rapping</a>. Commonly seen as a song that pioneered rap metal, this song has led to them getting pigeonholed as being a "rap metal" band.
<ul><li> Their second highest entry on the Hot 100 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong">completely straight-faced</a> cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie">The Commodores</a>' ballad "Easy". Before they recorded it, it was a song that they would perform in concerts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">intentionally annoy</a> close-minded metalheads in the audience.
</li></ul></li><li> The band Far are widely considered to be one of the first emo bands, but like many early groups in the genre, they had no hits before they disbanded in 1999. When they reunited in 2008, they released a joke cover of Ginuwine's R&amp;B hit "Pony" as a reunion single. That cover, which is heavier than their usual fare, became their first and only entry on the Billboard Alternative chart.
<ul><li> The band's frontman Jonah Matranga scored a Top 10 pop hit in 2006 with his guest appearance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Fort Minor</a>'s "Where'd You Go", a song that is stylistically a million miles away from Far's mid-90s work.
</li></ul></li><li> Texas power-pop group Fastball's "Out of My Head" was a ballad that was different from the rest of their album <em>All The Pain That Money Can Buy</em>. As a bit of extra (and unfair) trivia, due to a Billboard chart quirk that denied Hot 100 chart entry to their monster pop radio hit "The Way", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement">"Out of My Head" is also their only official Top 40 hit despite being much less remembered than "The Way".</a> Nowadays, when Fastball appear on one-hit wonder retrospectives and countdowns, it's usually for "The Way" and not "Out Of My Head".
</li><li> Fat Larry's Band were a funk dance group whose one crossover hit was "Zoom", a slow ballad.
</li><li> Fergie's had numerous hits independent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>, but one of her biggest would be "Big Girls Don't Cry". It's an adult contemporary song that sounds nothing like her normal "urban" material. It topped both the AC and Hot AC charts, which marks her only entry on the former, though some of her other songs scraped the end of the latter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter">Filter</a>'s "Take a Picture" is a light, melodic song that stands in contrast to their darker, heavier music. This leads to a funny moment when one unfamiliar with the group first plays "Hey Man, Nice Shot" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> World Tour</em> and then wonders why the band has a song on the mainstream pop-oriented <em>Band Hero</em>.
</li><li> Finger Eleven present a variation. Until they had a hit with "Paralyzer", their best known song was the slow ballad "One Thing," which was far less representative of their typical style.
<ul><li> And "Paralyzer", which was far more poppy than their usual work, is itself an example.
</li><li> Also, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> wrestling fans are only really familiar (aside from the aforementioned two songs) with "Slow Chemical", which the band tailor-made for the wrestler Kane to use from 2002 to 2008. It was a remake of Kane's instrumental theme and took more cues from that than the normal Finger Eleven sound.
</li></ul></li><li> Sort of averted by The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips">Flaming Lips</a>' "She Don't Use Jelly" - the band's only American chart single. Most fans tend to be weary of it still being the first thing many people think of when they hear the band's name, but the band still like it: Even though they're increasingly playing less early material live, the song is nearly always included in their setlists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s best-selling single in the UK is still, by quite a distance, the 1968 single "Albatross", an almost easy-listening instrumental bearing no resemblance to either the blues rock they normally played at the time, or the pop rock they became known for.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Focus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Focus">Focus</a>, "Hocus Pocus". It still gets more play than anything else they ever did (with the possible exception of "House of the King"). If you've heard it, you'll remember Thijs van Leer's yodeling performance ("...yodel-lay-ee yodel-om-pom-pom!"). It is quite distinct from the rest of their repertoire, and has misdirected potential fans in the past. However, the group never turned against it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> have a couple:
<ul><li> "Big Me", from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFightersAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFightersAlbum">their debut</a>, is an upbeat jangly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> song, and it was their first major hit single and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong">unlike any of their normal hits</a>.
</li><li> "Walking After You", a downtempto love ballad.
</li><li> "Everlong", their most popular song, sounds <em>very</em> different than their usual hard rock style, with drums clearly influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a>. This naturally makes it seem out of place when they perform it, hence why it's usually the show closer.
</li><li> "Learn to Fly", their biggest pop hit, was one of Dave's least favorite songs particularly for feeling it did not represent the band - and then its success led him to play it every night!
</li><li> "All My Life", their biggest hit in the United Kingdom, could count upon release it was <em>harder</em> than their usual style. Then the albums afterward produced plenty of heavy hits (such as their highest charting song in the US, "Best of You"), and it did not seem that much of a black sheep.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople">Foster the People</a>'s "Pumped Up Kicks", their only Top 40 hit, completely lacks the electro-pop slant of the rest of <em>Torches</em>. Interestingly enough, it was the song that got the band a record deal in the first place; the material that made "Pumped Up Kicks" seem incongruent came along <em>after</em> it.
</li><li> While it's still one of the Foundations' many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Songs</a>, "Build Me Up Buttercup" is a lot more upbeat than most of them (including their other hit "Baby Now That I've Found You").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankMills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankMills">Frank Mills</a> first gained notice as a singer-songwriter in his native Canada, with a couple of his vocal songs also becoming minor hits south of the border in the United States. But when a piano <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instrumentals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instrumentals">instrumental</a> he initially recorded as an album cut, "Music Box Dancer", became a major worldwide hit in 1979, he shifted his style to instrumental music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyWay">My Way</a>", which is more adult contemporary than his usual swinging style. Indeed, he never really liked it despite being his most famous song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SheikYerbouti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SheikYerbouti">Sheik Yerbouti</a></em> contained one in the form of "Dancin' Fool". The humor is very typical of Zappa's music, but the highly commercial melody and radio-friendly production is not. Ironically he was trying to <em>parody</em> these effects, but Top-40 radio programmers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">didn't get the joke</a>. See also "Valley Girl", the lead single from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShipArrivingTooLateToSaveADrowningWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShipArrivingTooLateToSaveADrowningWitch">Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch</a></em>.
<ul><li> "Bobby Brown (Goes Down)", from the same album as "Dancin' Fool", fits the bill as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreeBand">Free</a>, "All Right Now". Before that, they mostly did slow blues-rock ballads.
</li><li> Funk group Freeez's biggest hit was the uncharacteristically electro-influenced "I.O.U.", which was written and produced by Arthur Baker.
</li><li> Fuzzbubble were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a>-influenced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> band, albeit one somewhat incongruously signed to Bad Boy Records, a record label primarily known for hip-hop. The only charting song they were involved in was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock">Rap Rock</a> remix of Puff Daddy's "It's All About the Benjamins" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">you know, the version that formed the basis of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"All About The Pentiums"</a>). When their full-length album <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">finally came out</a>, they lampshaded this a bit with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a> - a cover of "It's All About the Benjamins" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> beat jazz.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks">Garth Brooks</a>, "Lost in You" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheLifeOfChrisGaines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheLifeOfChrisGaines">In the Life of Chris Gaines</a></em>) at least was his biggest single pop-wise (it was his only Top 40 pop single, believe it or not).
</li><li> Gary Clark Jr. is known for his eclectic mix of guitar-driven rock, blues, and soul. However, his biggest hit, and his only rock radio hit so far, is his cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' "Come Together" made for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">Justice League (2017)</a></em>. This one is a booming electronic rock track that sounds nothing like what he usually makes, mainly due to being produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JunkieXL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JunkieXL">Junkie XL</a>.
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a>. Once a sophisticated progressive rock band, "Follow You, Follow Me" (a gentle love ballad) and especially "Misunderstanding" (a poppier song done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>) <em>should</em> by all rights have been Black Sheep Hits for them. But they seemingly decided to go with it, and soon became <em>far</em> better known for a string of hit singles mostly fairly similar to those songs than for their more progressive work.
<ul><li> Genesis had been making a steady progression towards the mainstream even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> left ("I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" and "Counting Out Time" are probably the most "poppy" sounding of their early stuff, despite the latter being on a double concept album). They had no serious commitment to a particular style or image; they just did what they did and followed whatever worked for them. Hell, their first singles were done "in the style of" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a> in an attempt to appeal to producer Jonathan King, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">largely forgotten</a> first album, <em>From Genesis to Revelation</em> was essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ProcolHarum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ProcolHarum">Procol Harum</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues">The Moody Blues</a> clone. They didn't really have much success with it until Phil Collins underwent a nasty divorce and started throwing himself at his work ("Misunderstanding", along with "Man On The Corner", were essentially Collins solo tracks that the rest of the band liked).
</li><li> One of the most famous songs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>' solo career is "In the Air Tonight", which is much darker than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">usual output</a> (same deal with "I Don't Care Anymore").
</li><li> Two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>'s biggest solo hits, "Sledgehammer" and "Big Time" (both from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/So" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/So">So</a></em>), are quite a bit funkier and more light-hearted than his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progressiverock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Progressiverock">progressive</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic">World Music</a>-influenced songs that frequently tackle serious, mystical, and/or intellectual subject matter.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls">Goo Goo Dolls</a> were originally a punk-oriented alternative band similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a> (they were on Metal Blade Records - a famous metal label, and as such, were a strange fit there) with a few slower acoustic songs here and there. They decided to record a ballad ("Name") for their 1995 album <em>A Boy Named Goo</em>, which wound up being a major hit (their first, after five albums). They actually decided to roll with it and wound up completely changing their style to the softer pop-rock they're known for now.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead">Grateful Dead</a> - "Touch of Grey". The pop song introduced them to new fans in the 80's, whom their original fans absolutely hated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>, "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)". Also, to a lesser extent, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot">American Idiot</a></em>'s "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and "Wake Me Up When September Ends". Different from many examples in that they're not upset about it, and the songs are hardly out of place for the band anymore since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyFirstCenturyBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyFirstCenturyBreakdown">21st Century Breakdown</a></em> has many similar songs.
</li><li> "Sweet Child o' Mine" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a>, the riff was written as a joke by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slash">Slash</a>. The song was quickly written, it had been heard that Slash does not really like the song.
<ul><li> Actually, the intro was just Slash warming up in their rehearsal-room, and Axl just happened to hear it, loved it and found an old poem he'd written and voila, Guns' most famous song was written.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UseYourIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UseYourIllusion">Use Your Illusion</a></em> and all of <em>"The Spaghetti Incident?"</em> is this. In fact, when set-lists are put together, TSI is left off entirely, and only a few certain fan-favorites from UYI get on the set-lists. On Slash-tours, that'd be "Civil War". On GNR-shows, that'd be "Civil War", "Knockin' On Heaven's Door", "You Could Be Mine", "Estranged", "Don't Cry" and "November Rain" (the Ballad-Trio). And that's out of a setlist with up to 35 songs! 6 from UYI get to be played. Granted, the current GNR tour is called "Appetite For Democracy", which might help explain the shortage of UYI and TSI songs (and there's only one or two from <em>Lies</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> French singer Henri Salvador is best known for his child friendly comedy songs, yet he also wrote a lot more mature romantic ballads, which were never quite as popular.
</li><li> "This Guy's in Love with You", a #1 hit for Herb Alpert in 1968, is one of the few vocal entries among the mostly instrumental material of Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass. It's a Black Sheep Hit in another wayeven though it was recorded during the Brass' heyday, it was credited solely to Alpert.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ajfm');"><sup>Postscript </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ajfm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ajfm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Alpert went on to become the first (and to this day only) artist to hit #1 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 with vocal and instrumental performances, with "Rise" (1979) filling the latter slot.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies">The Hollies</a>' "Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress" is much harder than their usual material. Also, the lead guitar was played by vocalist Allan Clarke as opposed to Tony Hicks, and it contains a solo vocal from Clarke (one of the Hollies' trademarks was their great vocal harmonies). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> (Clarke's vocals in this song specifically imitate John Fogerty's from the song "Green River"). Interestingly, Fogerty himself views the song as somewhere between <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyQuiteFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyQuiteFunny">Actually Quite Funny</a> and "A damn good song in its own right" to the point where he has <em>happily sung the song in concert!</em>
</li><li> Hoobastank, "The Reason". It's completely a ballad, contrasting strongly with Hoobastank's usual alternative rock/alt-metal style (though they are mostly the former).
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHumanLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHumanLeague">The Human League</a>'s greatest hits, "Being Boiled", was produced by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">"Mk. 1" lineup</a>, whose producers, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, split with singer Phil Oakey to found Heaven 17 after their first two albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incubus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incubus">Incubus</a>'s breakout hit, "Drive", was much softer than their past work, though they've done more like it since.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesBrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesBrel">Jacques Brel</a>: One of Brel's most popular songs, "La Valse A Mille Temps" (and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion">Translated Cover Version</a>, "Carousel"), is a comedic number, almost completely devoid of any of the social commentary he is best known for. He once claimed in an interview that "La Valse" "should have never become such a success."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae">Janelle Monáe</a>'s highest charting song is "Yoga", which is a much more traditional R&amp;B/hip-hop song than most of her other music (which tends to fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a> trope).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction">Jane's Addiction</a> - "Been Caught Stealing", an upbeat hip-hop-esque song with dog barks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean">Jason Aldean</a> had his first big hit in 2007 with "Why", which was also his only love ballad for quite some time. "Big Green Tractor" and "The Truth" are also far mellower than his usual rock style. With the release of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> duet "Don't You Wanna Stay" (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a>), "Why" now looks like much less of a Black Sheep Hit, but the other two still qualify.
<ul><li> There's also "Dirt Road Anthem", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryRap">Country Rap</a> that's his biggest hit on the pop charts to date. Country-rap is not usually what he does.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonStarship">Jefferson Starship</a> mostly did rockers. Their biggest hit, "Miracles", was a soft ballad.
</li><li> "Aqualung" is one of the most recognizable songs by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a>, yet it lacks the flute prominent in their other songs. Another Tull example is "Living in the Past," scored in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime">Uncommon Time</a> of 5/4.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel">Jewel</a>, normally a folk-pop singer-songwriter, had an unexpected #1 hit on the dance charts with "Serve the Ego", especially when it received a remix from the DJs Gabriel &amp; Dresden. The success of "Serve the Ego" led her to lean fully into electronic dance-pop on her next album <em>0304</em>; unfortunately, said album is widely regarded by her fans as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">killed her mainstream success</a>, and she's largely returned to her older style since. She would later record a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> albums, <em>Perfectly Clear</em> and <em>Sweet &amp; Wild</em>, and two albums of children's music with <em>Lullaby</em> and <em>The Merry Goes 'Round</em>, but compared to "Serve the Ego" and <em>0304</em>, they were a much smaller diversion from her usual style.
</li><li> Joan Osborne is a raw and rootsy blues-rocker whose one big hit, "One of Us", is a relatively lightweight alternative-pop tune.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCage">John Cage</a>'s "4'33''."

<ul><li> Although he's also sometimes noted in the record books for another reason: His piece <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Slow_as_Possible">As Slow As Possible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is currently being played in a church in Germany... and if things go as planned, will be until <em><strong>September 5, 2640</strong></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Hurts So Good" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMellencamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMellencamp">John Mellencamp</a>. (And don't call him Cougar.) His greatest hit (besides "Jack and Diane"), but his later career should make clear he always wanted to be a "political" singer.
</li><li> Josh Turner is known for his very conservative, old-school approach to country music, with very modest production and lyrics (as exemplified by his breakthrough "Long Black Train", a Southern gospel song that many felt could've been cut in the 1940s or 1950s with almost no changes). But his biggest hits include "Your Man" and "Why Don't We Just Dance", both of which are unusually upbeat and sultry, and "Time Is Love", a more keyboard-driven country-pop song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a> felt this way for a long time about their ballads, fancying themselves an arena rock band. While Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain wrote and believed in ballads like "Faithfully", "Open Arms" and "Don't Stop Believing", Perry and guitarist Neal Schon clashed constantly over the creative direction of the band, especially since their ballads usually performed better.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas">Kansas</a>, "Dust in the Wind". Also "Carry On Wayward Son" — it lacks the "fiddle" strings that characterize many of their other songs.
<ul><li> The disco-ish "People of the South Wind" is a good example. Kansas were unusual among prog-rock bands, in that they would bend to record company pressure to write hit singles, and were able to produce songs that charted well and weren't embarrassing. Unlike, for instance, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Beach-Emerson-Lake-Palmer/dp/B0000033P6">Emerson, Lake and Palmer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since Kansas were much harder-edged than most other prog bands, they had a lot of mainstream success despite their main style being more along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a>, making the band itself an example of this trope.
</li><li> Then in 1986, they released their last Top 40 hit, "All I Wanted", which had more of a mid 80's adult contemporary sound to it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a>'s <em>Prism</em> is filled with pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pop">Pop</a> music, except for its biggest hit "Dark Horse", which is much more "urban" than her normal material. It became her second song to top the rhythmic charts (following "E.T.", itself an example).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney">Kenny Chesney</a> has had three styles since scoring his first big hits at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>: beachy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmyBuffett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmyBuffett">Jimmy Buffett</a>-esque tunes, introspective acoustic ballads, or arena rock. His two biggest hits on the country charts, "The Good Stuff" and "There Goes My Life", are none of the above — they're slicker and more mainstream than the likes of "You and Tequila", "A Lot of Things Different", or "Down the Road".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock">Kid Rock</a> with "Picture", a country-rock ballad duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow">Sheryl Crow</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2geqq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2geqq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2geqq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the official radio edit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">replaced her vocals</a> with those of Allison Moorer, but most stations played the Crow version anyway due to her greater name recognition</span> far removed from his usual mashup of hip-hop and rock. The song even became his first hit on <em>country</em> radio, which had never played him before.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingsOfLeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingsOfLeon">Kings of Leon</a>'s biggest hit (and their only pop hit) "Use Somebody" is completely different from the rest of their catalog, which leans far more towards indie rock, or its parent album, which has a more alternative rock feel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a> released "Detroit Rock City" as a single. Yet radios liked to play the piano and string based B-side ballad "Beth" instead. Their other big Top 10 pop hit was "Forever" (co-written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton">Michael Bolton</a> of all people, though then-guitarist Bruce Kulick used to be part of Bolton's band) which while somewhat heavier still falls firmly into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a> genre. The only other studio single to flirt with the top ten (reaching number 11) was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">disco</a> influenced "I Was Made for Lovin' You" - Kiss just can't get a hit single with songs in their trademark style.
</li><li> Krewella's biggest hit "Alive" is much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> than most of their other songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LanaDelRey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LanaDelRey">Lana Del Rey</a>'s only pop radio hit is a dance remix of "Summertime Sadness" by Cedric Gervais. It sounds nothing like her normal material, which is many things but <em>not</em> dance music.
</li><li> Lasgo is normally cheesy electro/pop trance, but "Only You" is retro Italo Hi-NRG.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>:
<ul><li> "Stairway to Heaven" is far more gentle and calmer than most of their loud and heavy output. To this day Robert Plant despises "Stairway to Heaven" and even encourages radio stations not to play it! The band prevented it from charting by refusing to release it as a single (although a few 7-inch promos were made for distribution to US radio stations). In at least one interview, Plant stated that he always thought of the more typical Zeppelin-sounding "Kashmir" as the definitive Led Zeppelin song. Despite Robert Plant's feelings towards his signature song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart">Heart</a> performed it live at Kennedy Center and the video released shows Plant in the audience, visibly moved by the performance.
</li><li> The reggae-tinged "D'yer Maker".
</li><li> The Brazilian-influenced "Fool in the Rain" which managed to be the band's final Top 40 hit in the US.
</li><li> Plant felt the same way towards the chart success of his cover of "Sea of Love" as part of his side project The Honeydrippers, fearing that he would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting">typecast</a> as a crooner.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack">Lee Ann Womack</a>'s career is dominated by neotraditionalist country with twangy vocals and plenty of fiddle and steel. But her biggest hit was the extremely slick pop ballad "I Hope You Dance".
</li><li> Most people who've heard of Leslie Fish know her first for "Banned From Argo", a lighthearted song about spacers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gj89');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gj89" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gj89');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as in the crew of space ships</span> misbehaving in bars and becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">Personae Non Gratae</a> as a result. However, most of her work, even most of her filks, is some kind of <em>protest</em> song.
</li><li> Lina Santiago's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only hit</a>, "Feels So Good (Show Me Your Love)", was Latin freestyle/electropop, while the rest of her debut (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">and only</a>) album, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, was mainly R&amp;B/pop ballads.
</li><li> When "Breaking the Habit" was at its high point, new listeners may never imagine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a> was best known for being the raprocking face of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a>. The song helped the band change their style more successfully.
<ul><li> "In the End" is this to a lesser extent compared to the other songs in their nu-metal era — it lacks the use of electronica that defined their other songs, instead being replaced by the use of piano. It's also a bit lighter compared to the other songs, hence why it was such a big pop hit.
</li><li> "Bleed it Out" was a big hit on rock radio. It was also the only song off <em>Minutes to Midnight</em> that featured Chester and Mike as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam">Vocal Tag Team</a>.
</li><li> This distinction even extends to Linkin Park's co-vocalist Mike Shinoda, whose side project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor">Fort Minor</a> only managed one pop hit: "Where'd You Go?". It is a far softer song than the rest of the material found on <em>The Rising Tied</em> when compared to the hard-edged underground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock">Rap Rock</a> featured throughout the rest of the album.
</li></ul></li><li> Lita Roza was much respected as a jazz and ballad singer, but her big hit record was the children's novelty song "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?", which she loathed so much that after recording a single take, she never sang it again.
</li><li> Country music band Little Texas' biggest hit, "My Love", was also the only single with keyboardist Brady Seals on lead vocals instead of usual lead singer Tim Rushlow. It was also a more relaxed midtempo song, instead of their usual upbeat country-rock fare or slick power ballads.
</li><li> The people who made "Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)" a hit in 1972 would be surprised when attending live performances by Looking Glass—it was a a hard-edged Jersey Shore Sound band. Many of its members later formed heavy metal band Starz
</li><li> Los Bravos recorded a large amount of material in the pop-rock vein. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">their only hit</a>, "Black Is Black", shows some soul influence (particularly from the Four Tops' "I Can't Help Myself") rather than pop-rock.
</li><li> Few people who aren't fans of flamenco music (or even those who are) can name any other song by Los Del Rio besides "Macarena".
</li><li> From Argentina's border, Brazilian band Los Hermanos had "Anna Júlia", a catchy pop-rock song unlike the rest of their material (specially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">the one stuff came after</a>), which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">they've grown to hate.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, primarily a player of hot jazz, is best remembered for the sentimental pop ballad "What a Wonderful World".
<ul><li> Either that or the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HelloDolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HelloDolly">Hello, Dolly!</a></em>, which is a Black Sheep Hit of a different style.

"Our House" itself is a far more conventional-sounding post-disco and soft rock song that sounds almost nothing like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTone">2 Tone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWavemusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWavemusic">New wave</a> material.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4almt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4almt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4almt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> They actually had another American hit on the Top 40, their cover of Labi Siffre's "It Must Be Love", but that song has been completely forgotten by Americans.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a>'s "Cherish" is a much lighter song than she usually scores hits with. She herself described it as "retarded" and almost didn't include it on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LikeAPrayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LikeAPrayer">Like a Prayer</a></em>, but it became a #2 hit.
</li><li> Similar to The Elastik Band mentioned above, The Magic Mushrooms gained immortality on the <em>Nuggets</em> compilation, which closed with their wacked-out 1966 minor hit "It's-A-Happening". They only released two follow-up singles, and the A and B sides are Folk Rock in the vein of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLovinSpoonful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLovinSpoonful">The Lovin' Spoonful</a>, rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock">Psychedelic Rock</a> that the first single (and the band name) would lead you to expect.
</li><li> Major Lazer scored a massive crossover hit with "Lean On", which became one of the biggest EDM crossovers since "Wake Me Up". It's also one of their only songs that doesn't feature any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">reggae</a> vocals.
</li><li> Maria McKee with "Show Me Heaven" mean't people expected her to be a pop balladeer when her usual style was more of a raw country rock.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Marillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Marillion">Marillion</a> had one with "Kayleigh", which is a <strong>lot</strong> poppier than their usual progressive rock style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s two biggest hits are his cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eurythmics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eurythmics">"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"</a> and his song "The Beautiful People". The first is unlike most of his work due to being a cover song (but admittedly, standard for his covers, which are "Take song with dark lyrics but more positive sound, inject the misery that oozes out of him, record") and the second really doesn't mesh with most of the album it is on, due to being heavier than half the songs, lighter than the other half, and being much more sane than most of the album (the figurative language is much easier to figure out, with stuff like "It's all relative to the size of your steeple", and the song in general being more traditional metal). The both are concert staples, but still don't fit in, partially due to the fact that each album is so insanely different that slamming them all together really can be just kinda odd.
</li><li> "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" was also a black-sheep hit when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt">Mark Chesnutt</a> covered it; before that song, he was mostly known for his honky-tonk influences, and certainly <em>not</em> for pop power ballads. It was also apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced upon him by the label</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeghanTrainor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeghanTrainor">Meghan Trainor</a> had one with "Like I'm Gonna Lose You", featuring John Legend. The song is more along the lines of classic soul, rather than her normal bubblegum pop/doo-wop style. It ended up being her biggest hit on adult contemporary stations.
</li><li> Melissa Manchester's biggest hit and only Grammy Award-winning song is "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" in 1982 which is a dance pop song while her primary music style is MOR. Her other top 10 hits, "Midnight Blue" and "Don't Cry Out Loud" are more representative of her usual style of music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>, "Nothing Else Matters" (the closest the band came to writing a ballad) and "The Unforgiven" from <em>The Black Album</em>, and all of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndJusticeForAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndJusticeForAll">And Justice For All</a></em> save for "One", which was the only song from said album that survived the band's live setlist after the tour for the album ended.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MGMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MGMT">MGMT</a>'s album <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OracularSpectacular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OracularSpectacular">Oracular Spectacular</a></strong> was a criticial and commercial hit and reached the charts with "Kids", "Time To Pretend" and "Electric Feel". Despite the album and singles' success its entire sound is very different compared to their regular music. Even "Kids" and "Time To Pretend" had appeared earlier on their EP "Time To Pretend" (2005) in a different version. As a result it became a Black Sheep Hit and the band themselves have made clear that they won't be making songs like those again.
</li><li> Michael Franti is a fusion musician who has been playing professionally since 1986 and recording since 1992, with nine albums in his name in a variety of styles from jazz to reggae to hip-hop. The only song of his to get significant airplay is 2009's "Say Hey (I Love You)", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Song</a> that barely represents the scope of his abilities.
</li><li> As an experimental musician, Mike Oldfield has never been interested in crafting pop hits, but he's remembered by most people as the guy who recorded "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells">Tubular Bells</a>", the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em>. Only a small part of the album-long composition was used in the film, but that part was released as a single and made the U.S. Top 10.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry">Ministry</a>'s "(Every Day Is) Halloween" was the biggest single from the band's period where they tried to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">new wave</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop">Synth-Pop</a> act. Once they became an Industrial Metal band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">they tried to shove it under the rug</a>. Same with "Revenge", their first hit song.
</li><li> Comedian/singer Minnie Pearl, best known for her appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeeHaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeeHaw">Hee Haw</a></em>, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">exactly one hit</a>: a completely serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerSong">Answer Song</a> to Red Sovine's heartwarming trucker's hit "Giddyup Go", titled appropriately enough, "Giddyup Go - Answer".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaLambert">Miranda Lambert</a> is known for her somewhat prominent rock influence and empowering lyrics, with up-tempos such as "Kerosene", "Gunpowder &amp; Lead", or "Mama's Broken Heart". But her first top 5 hit was the mid-tempo, bluegrass-influenced "White Liar". And its followup was "The House That Built Me", a sentimental ballad featuring only her voice and acoustic guitar, which became her absolute biggest hit to date.
</li><li> Modern English were generally a moody, goth-influenced post-punk band when the jangly, upbeat "I Melt With You" became a big hit - in the US they're still considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> (they did technically have two other hits on the Billboard charts, but one of them was just a 1990 remake of "I Melt With You").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModestMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModestMouse">Modest Mouse</a> - "Float On". While the song sounds pretty similar to their other songs, it is 1000x times more upbeat and positive than other songs by them. "Dashboard" far more so.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> had one with "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone", which they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulRevereAndTheRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulRevereAndTheRaiders">Paul Revere and the Raiders</a> by making the Top 20. Not too may songs of theirs are that hard. Also worthy of mention is the schizophrenic "Alternate Title", aka "Randy Scouse Git", which Mickey Dolenz wrote after watching "Til Death Do Us Part" on TV.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MontgomeryGentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MontgomeryGentry">Montgomery Gentry</a> reflects this with most of their #1 hits. The first was the in-your-face, vaguely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock">Rap Rock</a>-influenced "If You Ever Stop Loving Me", which stands out as being more aggressive than even their typical country-rock style. "Lucky Man", "Back When I Knew It All", and "Roll with Me" are far softer than their usual fare, with "Something to Be Proud Of" being their only #1 hit that reflects both their rowdiness and introspection in equal measure. Both "If You Ever Stop Loving Me" and "Roll with Me" stand out for being sung entirely by Troy Gentry with very little vocal contributions from Eddie Montgomery (mainly due to the latter having a second backing vocal from Five for Fighting), as opposed to their usual formula of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam">both of them sing lead alternately</a> or having Eddie lead and Troy harmonize (which was more common on their earlier singles before they established the back-and-forth formula on "My Town").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBig">Mr. Big</a>, a band known for having one of the fastest and most technically adept guitarists in rock and metal (and this was in the late 80s, when lightning-fast guitar shredders were everywhere) and a world famous bass guitar virtuoso, naturally had their biggest stateside hit with "To Be With You", a relatively slow and simple acoustic ballad.
</li><li> Mr. President's "Coco Jamboo", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">their only major hit in Anglophone countries</a>, was a reggae-rap tune very different from their traditional Eurodance material
</li><li> With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a>, they like to take it to an extreme, with their entire latest <em>album</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DangerDaysTheTrueLivesOfTheFabulousKilljoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DangerDaysTheTrueLivesOfTheFabulousKilljoys">Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</a></em> being the most successful album they've had so far, despite a different style to what they're often known for (This album was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Fun Personified as an album instead of a character</a> while they're often known for emotional '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeTerminator">don't stop singing</a>' powerful songs which are often mistaken for Emo). However, to fans who listened to their previous albums, they'd know they've had similar songs scattered through their previous albums, but none had been released. This time, all but a small percentage are anything but poppy and fun. Previous non-single songs, such as <em>House of Wolves</em> for example, have a similar tone and style to <em>Danger Days</em>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nazareth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> was a hard rock band that made the mistake to record a ballad, "Love Hurts", and has been mistaken for a ballad band ever since.
</li><li> While many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a>'s most memorable hits are in the ska-punk genre, the ballad "Don't Speak" is by far their most recognizable song, and arguably the song that turned singer Gwen Stefani into a household name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNeighbourhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNeighbourhood">The Neighbourhood</a>'s most popular song is "Sweater Weather", a romantic song with a vastly different tune than their other songs like "Afraid" or "Honest".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a>'s "Blue Monday" was only meant as an experiment with electronic instruments, and an encore instrumental piece which could be played after they had left the stage, but ended up as their best selling single.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave">Nick Cave</a>'s duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, "Where The Wild Roses Grow", was an international hit song, yet Cave himself felt a bit bothered by this as its soothing performance, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a> of the topic, is not all representative for the rest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MurderBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MurderBallads">the album</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj">Nicki Minaj</a> had a massive hit with "Starships", which is one of her few songs that's entirely sung rather than rapped.
</li><li> "Head Like a Hole" was originally this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>. It's a loud, angry rock song with a guitar-driven chorus while the rest of their debut album is dark synth pop with little, of any, guitar and more brooding or angsty lyrics. The follow-up <em>Broken</em> was full-on industrial metal in a style more similar to "Head Like a Hole" than any of their other material.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s "About a Girl" is the only song off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> that most people can name, and the only one you'll likely hear on the radio or in a public setting. For good reason, it's much more mainstream friendly than the rest of the album, being more in line with the material from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind">Nevermind</a></em>. <em>Bleach</em> is easily their least-accessible album in their entire library, being much noisier and denser than its polished follow-ups, with the exception of that song. It should be noted however that it wasn't a hit until <em>after</em> Kurt Cobain's death, due to being featured as the lead single off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MTVUnpluggedInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MTVUnpluggedInNewYork">MTV Unplugged in New York</a></em>, where before then it was very obscure (like the rest of <em>Bleach</em>), making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>.
</li><li> Minor example: Although Duane Allen is considered the lead singer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>, tenor Joe Bonsall sang lead on their most famous song, "Elvira".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a>:
<ul><li> "Gone Away", their 1997 song, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">tear-jerking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a> that sounds nothing like most of their comedic material. It was their only #1 hit on mainstream rock until 2015, and their first song to go gold in any country (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Australia</a>).
</li><li> "Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?", which became one of the band's few pop radio hits in their nearly 25-year career.
</li></ul></li><li> Another one whose first hit is the black sheep: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic">OneRepublic</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, they're best known for upbeat pop-rock like "Good Life", "Counting Stars", and "Love Runs Out", but try convincing anyone from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">previous decade</a> that that would be the case, when their first single was the ultra-slow "Apologize" (thanks to a redrummed backing track by superstar producer Timbaland) and their second was another ballad, "Stop and Stare" (though still a step towards the rock side, which was completely absent from the former).
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOsmonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOsmonds">The Osmonds</a>, purveyors of safe seventies pop music had a big hit with "Crazy Horses", a hard rock song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OtisRedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OtisRedding">Otis Redding</a> was already famous as an Stax/Volt R&amp;B artist when he recorded "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay". Three days later, he and most of the rest of his band died in a plane crash. The song became wildly popular (the first posthumous song to top the charts in the UK), even though it's very different from much of his <em>large</em> body of work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast">OutKast</a> have long been known for their endlessly creative brand of hip hop. Their biggest hit? "Hey Ya", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatles-esque</a> pop song, which became this trope mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">because Big Boi wasn't involved with that song</a>. If OutKast was just André 3000, there would have been more songs like "Hey Ya!". Follow-up "The Way You Move" was also more R&amp;B than rap; this time around André 3000 wasn't involved with the song, so if OutKast was just Big Boi, there would have been more songs like it.
</li><li> "Jackie Blue", by the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, sounds absolutely nothing like the rest of the album it appeared on (<em>It'll Shine When It Shines</em>), or much of the rest of the band's catalog for that matter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> is known for the metal he does. His only two songs to chart in the top 40 in the US were "Close My Eyes Forever" (a somber, melancholy duet with Lita Ford) and "Mama, I'm Coming Home" (about his impending "retirement"; also co-written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead">Lemmy</a>!), which are <em>not</em> indicative of the bulk of his discography. His highest-charting song in Britain, "Changes" (which hit no.1), is a father-daughter duet with Kelly, and a cover of what is <em>itself</em> a Black Sheep Hit of Black Sabbath's.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pantera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pantera">Pantera</a>'s biggest hit on rock radio was a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s "Planet Caravan". Like the original, it's a softer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock">Psychedelic Rock</a> number that sharply contrasts their hard-hitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrooveMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrooveMetal">Groove Metal</a> material. The <em>Far Beyond Driven</em> liner notes even acknowledge that this isn't the kind of material fans would normally expect from them - The following message is printed in place of the song's lyrics:
<div class="indent">This is a Black Sabbath song off of the <em>Paranoid</em> album. So don't freak out on us. We did the song because we wanted to. It has nothing to do with the integrity of our direction. It's a tripped out song. We think you'll dig it. If you don't, don't fucking listen to it. Thanks. On behalf of the rest of Pantera, Phil Anselmo '94.

<ul><li> "The Only Exception" is the band's biggest pop hit (or at least it was, until "Ain't It Fun" a few years later), and has managed to become one of many examples of "punk band with hit ballad" syndrome.
</li><li> "Ain't It Fun" is much funkier than anything else the band has made.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatBenatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatBenatar">Pat Benatar</a>'s "Love Is a Battlefield".
<ul><li> Rather typical of her later style; she and Neil Geraldo seem to indicate that their earlier style was more the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and that a change in record label produced songs like "Love Is a Battlefield" and "We Belong" that are more in line with their preferred style.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith">Patti Smith</a> was a founding mother of American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">punk music</a> who was shockingly profane for a female vocalist of her time, and brought to her music a strong feminist vibe. Her best-known hit is "Because The Night" (first heard on the 1978 record <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Easter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Easter">Easter</a></em>), a pop love ballad written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, which contains <em>none</em> of these elements.
<ul><li> "Hungry Heart" for Springsteen would qualify as well, being musically miles away (although lyrically similar) from his bleak late 70's/early 80's output. He originally wrote it for the Ramones, but recorded it himself after being chewed out by his manager for giving away his hit songs ("Because the Night", as well as "Blinded by the Light", which became a #1 hit for Manfred Mann, and "Fire", later a #2 hit for the Pointer Sisters). Most of his later singles from "Born In The U.S.A." were cut from the same cloth.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulaCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulaCole">Paula Cole</a>'s "I Don't Wanna Wait", a.k.a. the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek">Dawson's Creek</a></em> theme song. The rest of her work is much harder and darker. Yes, darker than a song about wanting to die.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a> had this with "Last Kiss". Even though it was a cover of an old 60's pop song, and only originally offered to the band's fan club, once radio stations picked it up it became their biggest hit.
<ul><li> The jury is still out if their second biggest American radio hit, "Better Man", also qualifies.
</li></ul></li><li> Jazz legend Peggy Lee will be remembered to kingdom come for "Fever", "It's A Good Day", "Is That All There Is?", "Why Don't You Do Right" and literally hundreds of other superbly performed torch songs...but her biggest hit by far was a forgettable, racist (by today's standards) number called "Mañana (Is Good Enough for Me)", sung in a faux-Mexican accent and comprising a string of stereotypes about Latin Americans. Latinos are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets">Once Acceptable Targets</a> but in 1948 they still were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>, which helps explain how that song got to #1 for nine weeks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterTosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterTosh">Peter Tosh</a>'s biggest hit "You Gotta Walk And (Don't Look Back)" is a very upbeat synth-heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">reggae</a> cover of the Temptations song, sung as a duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a>. Sounds nothing like his other work where he usually sounds more cynical.
</li><li> Invoked intentionally by early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra">Petra</a>, because their usual material was considered unacceptable for airplay on Christian radio.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2"</a> became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a>, something which the band hadn't planned, resulting in it being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">banned in South Africa</a>.
<ul><li> Their first commercially successful singles, "See Emily Play" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">"Money"</a> count for being groovier and more accessible than their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> sound.
</li></ul></li><li> "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's - their usual style is much more upbeat and is more pop-punk oriented, but their acoustic ballad was what became a major hit. Their only other Top 40 hits in the United States, "1234" and "Rhythm of Love", were <em>also</em> acoustic ballads (although both slightly more upbeat).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a> with "Every Breath You Take". A number one hit in many countries, it was the best selling single of 1983 in the US and the 5th best selling single of the decade. The Police's music style is a combination of New Wave, reggae, post-punk, and rock, but "Every Breath You Take" was borderline <em>soft rock</em> and a departure from their usual sound. Everyone of all ages has probably heard of this song at least once since almost any radio station still plays this song daily (it actually holds the record of one of the most requested songs in radio history) and many think it's a romantic ballad to this day. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">They are in for a huge surprise.</a>
</li><li> Primitive Radio Gods scored a hit in 1996 with the ethereal "Standing Outside A Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand", but the rest of the album it was taken from consisted of '80s style rock.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>:
<ul><li> John Deacon conceived "Another One Bites the Dust" as a "little ditty about a cowboy". It was initially not intended to be a single because it was so far and away from the rest of the album, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> managed to convince them it should be a single. They took the risk, and you can see how it paid off.
</li><li> "Bohemian Rhapsody", particularly the operatic middle section ("I see a little silhouetto of a man..."). Not only does it lie at one extreme of their range of styles, it also employs an eight-part harmony (overdubbed in the studio), so despite its huge popularity they have never been able to perform the entire song live.
</li><li> "Under Pressure" was the band's only big name single to be recorded alongside an outside artist, in this case David Bowie. It's gone on to be one of their most recognizable hits.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche">Queensrÿche</a>'s sole Top 40 hit, "Silent Lucidity", which is a mainstream rock ballad rather than their prior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal">Progressive Metal</a>.
<ul><li> Its source, <em>Empire</em> could be considered a Black Sheep Album, as the majority of it is lighthearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes-esque</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> of the more mainstream-leaning '80s sort, in stark contrast to the darker material that surrounds it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s "Creep", which is a very radio-friendly pop/indie rock song with a relatively traditional guitar/bass/drum sound. It's not only very different than most of the rest of the parent album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PabloHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PabloHoney">Pablo Honey</a></em>, but completely different than Radiohead's subsequent stuff, which is heavily electronic, jazz, and pure-rock. Even 20 years later, it's still their most recognized (but hardly only) hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a> was a metal pioneer, but their one and only Top 40 hit was "Stone Cold," a slow song from the Joe Lynn Turner era.
<ul><li> In the UK at least, "Since You've Been Gone" was a big hit, but it is a glam rock song.
</li></ul></li><li> "Mujer Amante", a love song by the Argentinean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RataBlanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RataBlanca">Rata Blanca</a> was their biggest hit ever. The rest of their music was 100% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>. (Even at high speeds and heavy sound.)
</li><li> Ray Parker Jr.'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters</a>", which sounds uncannily like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HueyLewisAndTheNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HueyLewisAndTheNews">Huey Lewis and the News</a> song "I Want a New Drug" but sounds nothing like Parker's other work. This led to legal action being taken and an out-of-court settlement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens">Ray Stevens</a> is mainly known for his novelty songs. However, he had his biggest hit with the extremely serious and sentimental "Everything Is Beautiful". He had another serious hit earlier with "Mr. Businessman" and also had a country hit with the Gospel standard "Turn Your Radio On".
</li><li> Record label Razor &amp; Tie mostly serves as an outlet for hard rock artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThatRemains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllThatRemains">All That Remains</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless">The Pretty Reckless</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starset">Starset</a>. But they will always be best known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop">Kidz Bop</a>, an act who cant be any more different from the former three, plus, Razor and Tie started out as a reissue and compilation label.
</li><li> "Under the Bridge" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> got a lot of people buying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BloodSugarSexMagik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BloodSugarSexMagik">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a></em> expecting more of the same and not an album full of funk with only maybe two other ballady songs. Imagine all the suburban housewives who liked "Under the Bridge" and wound up stumbling into "Sir Psycho Sexy"!
<ul><li> "Under the Bridge", while being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGentleSong">Surprisingly Gentle Song</a>, nevertheless treats a fairly dark topic - Anthony Kiedis's reflections on everything and <em>everyone</em> he's thrown away in his life because of drugs, and the city/spirit of Los Angeles as the only entity that will support him unconditionally.
</li><li> They managed an inverted version of this later on, with the hit "Can't Stop" from the album <em>By The Way</em>. Can't Stop is the only example of funk-pop on the album. The remaining tracks are mostly ballads, though there are a few exceptions.
</li></ul></li><li> Aaron Barrett of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish">Reel Big Fish</a> has gone on record saying "... ["Sell Out" was] some dumb novelty song I wrote ten years ago.".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> has the peppy "Shiny Happy People", which even features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s">Kate Pierson</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">And damn, they hate this song</a>.
<ul><li> "Radio Song", a funk-rap-rock song with KRS-One.
</li><li> "Stand", which is far more bubblegummy than their normal output.
</li></ul></li><li> The Rembrandts, "I'll Be There For You" (the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> theme), a more mainstream-pop friendly song compared to their alternative power-pop sound.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a> are best known by the mainstream public for their underground hit "Kaw Liga", which is a very danceable cover of a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a> and very catchy and slick compared to their general experimental output.
</li><li> Canadian indie-rock band Rheostatics had to write an in-universe hit single for the soundtrack of the film version of <em>Whale Music</em>, and the song ended up becoming an actual Top 40 hit, proving that they <em>could</em> write a hit single if they wanted to. They didn't enjoy the experience and never tried it again.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> frequently plays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a> (she is ostensibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemporaryRAndB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemporaryRAndB">Contemporary R&amp;B</a> singer), she had this happen to her with FourFiveSeconds, her 2015 collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. It's a folk tune that doesn't sound at all like anything else she's ever done.
<ul><li> An earlier single "Take a Bow" is much slower, and more suited towards adult contemporary than her normal 'urban' material.
<ul><li> "Stay" is also much slower than her normal material, and ended up being her biggest hit on AC and Hot AC radio.
</li></ul></li><li> Even her signature song "Umbrella" falls into this, not so much in sound as it is in subject matter. Many, many of her songs are about love, and often, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">sex</a>. "Umbrella" however, is completely about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>. It's not often she sings about platonic relationships.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst">Rise Against</a> usually write blistering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk">Hardcore Punk</a> anthems with <em>heavy</em> political themes, but they had a big hit with the subdued, apolitical acoustic song "Swing Life Away".
</li><li> Comedian/singer Rodney Carrington rarely saw chart action due to the highly profane nature of his songs, which include such titles as "Letter to My Penis", "Dancin' with a Man", "Morning Wood", "Burning Sensation", et cetera. But in 2009, he had his only major chart hit to date with "Camouflage and Christmas Lights" — a completely serious song about a soldier celebrating Christmas while on active duty.
</li><li> Rollergirl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only major hit</a>, a cover of Sunscreem's "Love You More", is trance, while most of her other songs are Eiffel-65 style Nu-Italo/Europop.
</li><li> This often happens with veteran artists who try changing their sound to meet current tastes. "Miss You", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' flirtation with disco, is one example.
</li><li> "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" by Rupert Holmes, who otherwise does serious work. This song is "the success that ruined his career."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>'s only Top 40 hit in the United States (charting at #21) and only number one hit in Canada was "New World Man" off their 1982 album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Signals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Signals">Signals</a></em>. The song was a huge hit on the radio, but the only reason the song was written was to balance out Side A and Side B on cassette and vinyl versions of the album. The song was written in one day and recorded at the very end of production. The song departs the progressive-elements that characterizes Rush and it has a standard 4/4 time signature throughout the whole song, a very rare thing for Rush to do. The song essentially follows a standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus pattern in the absence of a guitar solo and the bridge sounds like something that should be on a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a> was an artist who specialized in folk and alternative music, and she commonly received airplay on rock radio. However, her two biggest hits, 1998's "Adia" and "Angel" (both from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Surfacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Surfacing">Surfacing</a></em>), were adult contemporary piano ballads. Ever since the success of these two singles, she's been producing nearly nothing but piano-based adult contemporary music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions">Scorpions</a>, "Wind of Change". Even though this song became the hymn for the Berlin Wall fall, vocalist Klaus Meine said that the song had actually been written long before, and he happened to stumble on it when looking at some annotations.
<ul><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a> "Still Loving You".
</li><li> Ever since "Wind of Change", all their hits have been ballads. And we're still talking about the band that gave us "Rock You Like a Hurricane".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Seether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Seether">Seether</a> are usually considered to be South Africa's answer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDaysGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDaysGrace">Three Days Grace</a>. Then they released "Words As Weapons", a rousing, "Mad World"-influenced alt-rock anthem, gaining them new-found success. Then of course there's "Broken", which was their only pop hit. It's far softer than their normal material, and their only song to feature guest vocals (courtesy of frontman Shaun Morgan's then-girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Amy Lee</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShadowsFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShadowsFall">Shadows Fall</a>, while no strangers to power ballads ("The Art of Balance", "What Drives the Weak", "Inspiration on Demand", etc.), had never made one that was quite as modern rock-oriented as "Another Hero Lost". It was an obvious bid at widespread radio play; while it did accomplish that, it also pissed off dedicated fans (who hated it for being such an obvious radio song) and alienated non-fans who latched onto it (as the parent album was far heavier than that song). The band quickly turned against it and stopped playing it live around the end of 2008 and never brought it back.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shinedown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shinedown">Shinedown</a>'s cover of "Simple Man". Constantly screamed for at concerts by drunk people who know the band only for Brent Smith's rendition of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> classic. Old interviews had the band stating that they would never play it live again, due to guitarist Jasin Todd's departure. It is thought among some fans that the song's resurfacing in their Carnival of Madness tour is due to pressure from their record label Atlantic, and the band actually hates playing the song. Singer Brent Smith has been heard to drop snide remarks at fans who show up only to hear Simple Man ("How many of you want to hear Simple Man so you can leave?").
<ul><li> To a lesser extent, Shinedown's biggest hit to date (and their only pop hit) "Second Chance" is not very representative of the band's typical hard rock style, although the band does embrace this song.
</li></ul></li><li> The Silencers, a Scottish rock band with a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">cult following</a>, are known for their highly prolific and eclectic output, but most of their songs are generally categorized as "punk", and they skew towards a rather aggressive sound with strong electronic influences. But their best-known song is probably their mellow and soulful cover of the traditional Scottish folk song "Wild Mountain Thyme", which caught on after it was used in a Scottish tourism ad. The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MagG8J--BBI">music video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the most viewed Silencers video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> by a pretty substantial margin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slipknot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slipknot">Slipknot</a>'s lead single off their successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">self-titled</a> debut, "Wait and Bleed", could be considered an example. While it has the speed, angst and chaotic qualities of most of their output, it's by-far the least heavy non-electronic song on the record. It's also one of the album's shortest songs.
<ul><li> Another example from may be the record's other single, "Spit It Out". While it's faster and longer than "Wait and Bleed", it's one of the band's few songs that has out-and-out rapping, causing them to often be pegged as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal">Rap Metal</a>.
</li><li> Same goes for "Before I Forget". Even taking <em>Volume 3</em> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> in account, the melodic rock nature of the song stands in contrast to the less conventional arrangements of the album's other songs. Doubly so for "Vermillion", the band's rather twisted attempt at a romantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a>.
</li><li> In keeping with the theme, "Left Behind" is <em>Iowa</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to "Wait and Bleed" in terms of song structure and style.
</li></ul></li><li> Before they enlisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a> and changed their name to Faces, the Small Faces were a mod rock band comparable to a bluesier version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>. Their biggest hitand the one song of theirs widely heard in the USwas "Itchycoo Park", a flower power number they wrote as a joke.
<ul><li> In the UK, they scored another Black Sheep Hit with the equally jokey "Lazy Sunday". The lukewarm reception of the band's more serious songs led Steve Marriott to leave the group in order to form Humble Pie.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth">Smash Mouth</a>'s first hit single, "Walkin' on the Sun", was a '60s-esque pop tune; the rest of their debut album was mostly pop-ska, with the exception of a cover of War's "Why Can't We Be Friends?" Like Sugar Ray, who charted at about the same time, they embraced their Black Sheep Hit, and their second album was much heavier on the retro-pop.
</li><li> One of the Smithereens' biggest hits? "Too Much Passion", a light soul-pop song that sounds nothing like their guitar-driven sound. Their other top 40 hit, "A Girl Like You", is an upbeat power pop love anthem also atypical of their headier fare.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a> have "How Soon Is Now?" It's probably their best-known song, but its dreamy atmospheric quality is nothing like their normal indie rock sound.
</li><li> Soft Cell's megahit, "Tainted Love", is nothing like most of their other material, which is loaded with kinky sexual content that would not be played on most radio stations. In fact "Tainted Love" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">originally an obscure 1965 Motown song performed by Gloria Jones</a>.
</li><li> Despite being their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SonicYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SonicYouth">Sonic Youth</a>'s "Teen Age Riot" is highly atypical compared to their usual oeuvre, consisting of the standard verse-chorus structure that they more often than not forego.
</li><li> Sophie B. Hawkins's biggest pop hit is "As I Lay Me Down," which lacks the overt sexual content of most of the rest of her repertoire (including her other big hit, "Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>'s "Black Hole Sun" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>, with a tone described by the band as "Beatles-esque", but became the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a>.
</li><li> Outside of their native UK, the vast majority of people have probably only heard one Spandau Ballet song, the jazzy ballad "True". This actually sounds nothing like the majority of their very synth-heavy work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze">Squeeze</a> seem to make a habit of being atypical in their successes:
<ul><li> Their first significant success was Take Me Im Yours, In which the lyrics depict an exotic fantasy world. Then they went on to a career of closely observed slice-of-life pop songs.
</li><li> "Cool for Cats", one of their biggest hits in the UK, was sung by guitarist Chris Difford rather than usual lead singer Glenn Tilbrook.
</li><li> "Tempted", probably their biggest hit in the US, has main vocals by Paul Carrack during a brief stint with the band.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a>'s biggest hit in the UK is "Haitian Divorce", a reggae-influenced song that is not only atypical of their normal jazz rock sound, but also one of their more obscure singles in their native United States. It's one of only a few of their singles to miss the Billboard Hot 100 entirely. The main reason "Haitian Divorce" was a hit in the UK was because it came out at a time when reggae music was particularly popular thanks to the likes of Bob Marley. It should be noted that the song doesn't get radio airplay very often anymore.
<ul><li> In the US, they had a big hit with "Dirty Work", a country-influenced ballad which features effeminately voiced guest vocalist David Palmer on lead vocals. At the time, songwriter and usual singer Donald Fagen felt Palmer could help make the song a bigger hit, and had also hired him to sing vocals live, due to lack of confidence in singing and playing piano at the same time. After the album <em>Can't Buy a Thrill</em> (which features vocals from Fagen, Palmer and fellow bandmember Jim Hodder), Fagen would assume lead vocals for all their songs - partly for continuity and partly because he felt nobody could convey the cynicism in his lyrics as well as he could. This is something of a subversion in that the two other hits from <em>Can't Buy a Thrill</em> - "Do It Again" and "Reelin' in the Years" - do feature Fagen singing lead.
</li></ul></li><li> Stevie B was a singer in the late 80s and early 90s who was part of Miami's freestyle scene and, as a result, wrote and performed mostly dance songs. His only number 1 (and only top 10 hit, for that matter) on the Billboard Hot 100 was "Because I Love You (The Postman Song)," a piano-based love ballad. Unlike his previous singles, this one never even touched the dance charts, but that never stopped it from being his most well-known single.
</li><li> One of the most popular Stingers songs with fans of the 80s cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> is "Destiny". Riot usually sings lead and the women are backup however in this song Riot only sings the chorus.
</li><li> Stone Sour's two biggest hits, "Bother" and "Through Glass." (the latter starts off ballad-y and gets harder as it goes, but is still different from their other songs).
</li><li> The Stranglers' "Golden Brown", a baroque composition that was completely different from the band's earlier punk rock sound.
<ul><li> The Stranglers had no particular commitment to any one style. Their roots were actually in folk rock, but they abandoned that with the emergence of punk/new wave.
</li></ul></li><li> The Strawbs specialised in folk-rock, mostly based on timeless poetic themes, historical events or personal experiences. The majority of their songs originated from frontman Dave Cousins, who sang lead vocal on all but a few. "Part of the Union", by far and away their biggest hit ever, was a topical pub-rock anthem that took the rise out of the militant workers who were butting heads with the UK's employers and government at that time. It was written by Rick Hudson and John Ford and performed with John Ford on lead vocals. The huge success of this Black Sheep Hit was one of the main factors in Hudson and Ford's departure from the group, and also resulted in it being excluded from the playlist entirely when they took their next album on tour. (However, Hudson, Ford and PotU were all eventually returned to the fold.)
<ul><li> Also, "Part of the Union" is sometimes assumed to be a pro-union anthem.
</li></ul></li><li> "Babe" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx">Styx</a> is a slow ballad, unlike most of their other more rock-oriented works. "Mr. Roboto" is mostly synthesized, while most of their songs were guitar-based.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SugarRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SugarRay">Sugar Ray</a>'s "Fly". To the point where they had a song that sounded like it ("Every Morning") released as the first single from their next album <em>14:59</em>. And another, "Someday", from the same album...and <em>another</em>, "When It's Over", as the lead single from their <em>next</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelftitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelftitledAlbum">album.</a>
<ul><li> "Every Morning" was likely the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. Sugar Ray were originally an abrasive punk-influenced alt-rock band who turned out to have an unlikely talent for sweet-sounding ballads. Their singer commented that they had turned into the kind of band they hate.
</li></ul></li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugarland">Sugarland</a>'s biggest hits was "Stay", a ballad done entirely on organ and acoustic guitar. It is also one of the only songs in their catalog where lead singer Jennifer Nettles sings entirely by herself (although the other member, Kristian Bush, is still the one playing guitar on it). The five-minute minimalist ballad was far removed from anything else in Sugarland's discography, never mind anything else on country radio at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sum41" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sum41">Sum 41</a> is a skate punk / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a>, but their biggest hit "Fat Lip" is one of their only songs to feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRap">rapping</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>:
<ul><li> Her first ever Billboard Hot 100 #1 song "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" leans more towards being catchy, radio friendly bubblegum pop (with some electronica thrown in for good measure) when compared to her more thoughtful, guitar based country-pop fare. It (along with its parent album <em>Red</em>) also marked a huge turning point in her career - her switch from straight country-pop to more mainstream music.
</li><li> That song's follow-up "I Knew Were You Trouble" is a <em>dubstep</em> song, albeit in a more restrained manner.
</li><li> "Shake It Off" is a horn-driven, Motown-like song with a tongue-in-cheek cheerleader chant in the middle and not a hint of country elements; even "Trouble" had acoustic guitar strumming in the verses. It was even different from much of its parent album, <em>1989</em>, which is built around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980's</a>-influenced synth-pop.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a>' "Wild Wild Life", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrueStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrueStories">True Stories</a></em>, was a mainstream rock song rather than the eclectic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic">World Music</a>-influenced sound the band became known for on albums like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RemainInLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RemainInLight">Remain in Light</a></em>.
</li><li> Ten Years After's biggest hit, "I'd Love to Change the World", was much softer than their usual hard-rock style.
</li><li> Terror Squad's only #1 hit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">and only hit whatsoever</a>) was "Lean Back", a party track that introduced a dance move made for people who can't dance. This song came in the midst of the rest of the album, which feature less mainstream-friendly material that was <em>not</em> made for the radio or party playlists.
</li><li> Latin music star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Thalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Thalia">Thalia</a>'s "I Want You", a deliberate and successful attempt at a US crossover pop hit, but generally considered a throwaway by her regular fanbase.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>'s "Whiskey in the Jar" was originally recorded as an Irish in-joke and as B-side to one of their singles. When the management got hold of it, they flipped it to the A-side and it became a massive hit, much to the band's chagrin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> covering it didn't help too much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith">Toby Keith</a>'s biggest crossover hit is "Red Solo Cup", a silly acoustic novelty song far outside his usual mainstream sound, <em>and</em> one of only a handful of singles that he did not co-write.
<ul><li> His 2000 hit "How Do You Like Me Now?!" is his biggest hit on the country charts. At the time, it was far more cocky and in-your-face than he had ever been before, but instead of letting it be a black-sheep hit, he began changing his style to match. Similarly, the post-9/11 "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue (The Angry American)" was a jarring change for him as he had never done a patriotic song before, but its success led to him doing several more.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>, despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">mastery of a myriad of different genres and styles</a>, may be best known for the latter-day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a> rip-off "Bang the Drum All Day". Especially by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Green Bay Packers</a> fans.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note51jvz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note51jvz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note51jvz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The song is played after every Packers touchdown at their home stadium, Lambeau Field.</span>
<ul><li> All of Rundgren's big hits ("Bang the Drum All Day", "Hello It's Me", "I Saw the Light", "We Gotta Get You a Woman") are from the poppier side of his music. He can get <em>really</em> experimental and weird from time to time (<em>A Wizard, A True Star</em>; the early Utopia albums).
</li><li> He was so disgusted with the vapidness of his biggest hit "I Saw the Light" (which he insists his record label forced him to record, and he writes off as a "bad Peter Frampton wannabe song"), that he intentionally quit the high-profile music business to focus on producing other artists while occasionally releasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">more low-profile but critically-acclaimed</a> albums.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto">Toto</a>'s "Africa". The song was almost omitted from the <em>Toto IV</em> album, since the band in general was tired of it, and some members even thought it didn't sound like Toto at all.
</li><li> "Christmas Canon" is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra">Trans-Siberian Orchestra</a>'s most famous works, yet it's very different than most of their albums and songs. Instead of using electric guitars, the song strives for a children's choir, pianos and strings instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt">Travis Tritt</a> is known mainly for big-voiced impassioned ballads (including all of his #1 hits — "Help Me Hold On", "Anymore", "Can I Trust You with My Heart", "Foolish Pride", and "Best of Intentions") or rowdy honky-tonk numbers ("Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)", "T-R-O-U-B-L-E", "Put Some Drive in Your Country"). But in late 2000-early 2001, he scored one of his biggest career hits with "It's a Great Day to Be Alive", a folksy sounding, light-hearted ditty about enjoying life.
</li><li> The British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> band Tubeway Army had exactly one big hit: "Are Friends Electric?", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop">Synth-Pop</a> tune that came into existence after their lead singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman">Gary Numan</a> had found a stray Minimoog in the studio. The reason why they had no more hits: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">Gary Numan dissolved the band because he wanted to switch to synthpop entirely, and he didn't need a band anymore for that</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles">The Turtles</a>, under pressure from upstairs to put out hit material, recorded "Elenore", deliberately going for the trite and cheesy ("Elenore/gee, I think you're swell") - it was a big hit. The band's best known song, the #1 hit "Happy Together", was created in a similar way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UriahHeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UriahHeep">Uriah Heep</a>, a hard rock group, had their biggest hit in Germany with "Lady in Black", a semi-acoustic song that borders on progressive folk. The keyboardist Ken Hensley wrote it, changed from his usual Hammond to Mellotron strings for a change and even contributed the lead vocals because David Byron refused to sing it. Probably the only reason why this didn't happen in the UK and the USA is because it was kept from being released as a single there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a>'s "Brown Eyed Girl" is <em>way</em> poppier than most of his other stuff. It <em>really</em> doesn't help that Morrison was broke, desperate, and had no star leverage when he wrote it. Because he was forced to sign the rights to Bang Records, he gets virtually no ongoing royalties whatsoever from what is still his most popular song (which is why he was still broke and desperate when he recorded his career-defining album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AstralWeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AstralWeeks">Astral Weeks</a></em>). Yet the fans still expect to hear it at gigs, which does not help his legendary curmudgeonliness.
</li><li> Velvet is an Italian band whose most popular song is the poppy, catchy "Boyband". The problem is, they are an indie rock band mostly influenced by Britpop and AOR, and that song is a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy Band</a> phenomenon at the peak of its popularity in the early 2000s. Not only that song has very little to do with the rest of their discography since then, but the general public took it at face value despite it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">being clearly satirical</a>. Thus most listeners didn't take them seriously anymore and their sales and popularity suffered.
</li><li> "All in the Mind", the title track of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve">The Verve</a>'s first single, is in a very different style from the rest of the band's early output as seen on the <em>Verve EP</em>, which was more strongly psychedelic or shoegazer.
<ul><li> "Bittersweet Symphony", their sole American hit, which was certainly more mainstream in its sound than their normal output.
</li></ul></li><li> Vince Vance &amp; the Valiants were mostly known for their novelty songs, such as "Bomb Iran" (a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeachBoysParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeachBoysParty">version of "Barbara Ann"</a>) and the flashy appearance of Vance. However, their most famous song is the fairly serious Christmas song "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a> song from her album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerryChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerryChristmas">Merry Christmas</a></em>), which also has Lisa Layne doing the vocals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WalkTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WalkTheMoon">Walk the Moon</a>'s "Shut Up and Dance" became a surprise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>, being their first song to hit the <em>Hot 100</em> (entering the Top 10). It's also different from their repertoire as it's far more poppier than their normal material, which usually targets alternative radio.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings">Waylon Jennings</a> hated "Luckenbach, Texas", because it was way too conventional and derivative for his outlaw country style, but he recorded it anyway because he figured it would be a huge hit. He was right: it was his biggest hit on the country charts and crossed over to the pop Top 40 too.
</li><li> Filipino rock band Weedd was, by nature, a band of 16-year-old high school boys who drew their influence from the '70s hard rock their dads most likely listened to. But their only mainstream hit was the faux-reggae "Long Hair", a novelty throwaway about how teachers in their school didn't like long bangs and "undercut" hairdos, as was the style in the mid-'90s.
</li><li> Canadian alternative R&amp;B artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd">The Weeknd</a> made a surprise detour into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave">Synthwave</a> territory with his late 2019 hit "Blinding Lights".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ween">Ween</a>'s biggest hit was "Push Th' Little Daisies", a cheerful, upbeat pop-rock song that is remarkably different from the rest of the band's work. Their penultimate album <em>quebec</em> was also the most critically well-received of their career, despite it being tonally extremely different from the remainder of their work (being an extremely downbeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> album for the most part).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>'s Green Album got lots of airplay for "Hash Pipe", which had a harder sound than most of the emo the band regularly played, and a <em>much</em> harder sound than anything from that album.
<ul><li> The Green Album's second single "Island in the Sun" then went and did the opposite, taking the album's poppy direction and going even further with it.
</li><li> "Beverly Hills" is a better example. It's their biggest hit, and it sounds nothing like the rest of the album (Mostly soft ballads)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>:
<ul><li> While parody artists frequently adapt their output to match the music of the times, was there anyone who watched him and his band develop their fame in the "Eat It" era who believed that his first top 10 hit in the US was going to be a <em>rap</em>? "White And Nerdy" is his biggest American hit to date.
</li><li> Weird Al's original composition "You Don't Love Me Anymore", a breakup song with humorously brutal lyrics, was a decent hit in Canada and one of the most popular ballads in the Philippines in 1992 and 1993 — probably the only Weird Al song many Filipinos instantly recognize. So popular was the song in the Philippines that it inspired a song called "Sinaktan Mo Ang Puso Ko" (semi-literally translated to "You Broke My Heart") by Michael V, who is arguably the country's answer to Weird Al for his parodies of popular songs and original novelty recordings. Even in the States, "You Don't Love Me Anymore" stands out for being one of his only non-parody songs that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> another artist.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewLloydWebber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewLloydWebber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> is known for his work in musical theatre, he used to produce an Eurodance remix single of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em>'s theme song in 1992 under the pseudonym "Doctor Spin".
</li><li> Wild Cherry was a 70's rock band. As disco became more popular, many of their audience, particularly the black members, started asking them to play "funky" music. So they came up with the song "Play That Funky Music". which became their only number one hit (more specifically their only hit ever), although it was nothing like the rest of their music.
</li><li> Kim Wilde is best known for perky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a> jams such as "Kids in America"; however her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop">Synth-Pop</a> single "Cambodia" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">was a surprise hit in many European countries</a>, though it never caught on in the UK or US.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WithinTemptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WithinTemptation">Within Temptation</a>'s "What Have You Done" was a commercial success, but many longtime fans dislike the presence of male vocals (especially from a singer who never appeared in any other WT track) and dismiss the song as an Evanescence rip-off.
<ul><li> It could be argued that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a> had their own black sheep hit with "Bring Me to Life", as that song was recorded with someone from a different band entirely, and 99.98% of their output lacks male backing vocals. Said male backer was added due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and Amy Lee released <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5QFLV_lzeQ">a version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that lacked it in 2017 (claiming to have been happy to do so).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WizKhalifa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WizKhalifa">Wiz Khalifa</a>'s "See You Again" was recorded for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FuriousSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FuriousSeven">Furious 7</a></em> soundtrack and was a pop-rap song combined with a piano-based ballad, which is completely at odds compared to usual urban stuff. It became his first bona-fide mainstream hit, becoming much bigger than its already-huge parent movie and the biggest rap hit since "Thrift Shop".
<ul><li> This also extends to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Furious7Soundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Furious7Soundtrack">Furious 7 Soundtrack</a></em> itself. The entire licensed soundtrack has a very 'urban' feel with rap, EDM, and latin music. "See You Again", which is a piano ballad that's placed almost in the middle of the album, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">is very incongruent compared to the rest found throughout.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> best-known song is "Maps"—a somber, minimalist love ballad that's quite different from the band's usual upbeat, eclectic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop">Indie Pop</a> sound. For comparison's sake, try listening to the song before playing one of their other big hits, like "Heads Will Roll", "Zero", or "Gold Lion". If you're not a fan, you could be forgiven for not realizing that it's the same band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a> was to be a single album side project that parodied Exotica. Instead, the album became one of the most important in Japanese recording history.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> - "Owner of a Lonely Heart", compared to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> work from before that song/album.
<ul><li> Which is largely because they had undergone massive turnover right before that album. It was the same band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>.
</li><li> Their second biggest hit, "Roundabout", while poppy, is still "progressive", but not nearly as much as their other material.
</li><li> Their 1977 minor hit, "Wondrous Stories", was more soft-rock and folksy (well, with heavy Mellotrons and synthesizers) than the band's usual style of the time.
</li></ul></li><li> You Me at Six's biggest hit in America was "Room to Breathe", a song that takes more cues from alternative metal than their typical pop-punk style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand">Zac Brown Band</a>, despite being a constant player of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a> (they are nominally a country band), pulled this off with "Heavy Is the Head", their 2015 collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisCornell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisCornell">Chris Cornell</a> which went to #1 on Mainstream Rock while not charting on any country-based format. The track is a great deal heavier and harder than anything else ZBB has done before. "Beautiful Drug" also stands out as their first stab at an electronica influence.
</li><li> How many people could have guessed that the biggest hit of Zedd's career in the United States would be, of all things, a collaboration with a <em>country singer</em> of all people? "The Middle" with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarenMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarenMorris">Maren Morris</a> is his highest charting hit as a lead artist. It also sounds nothing like the country music that Morris normally makes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZWard">ZZ Ward</a>'s single "Last Love Song," which has received solid airtime on radio stations, is a pretty traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong">Break-Up Song</a>: slow, melancholy and despairing. The rest of her debut album, "'Til The Casket Drops," is quite upbeat and energetic, even when dealing with breakups or bad relationships.
</li><li> David Johansen, former singer for the proto-punk band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls">New York Dolls</a>, recorded the pop song "Hot, Hot, Hot" under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter. He later described the song in an interview as the "bane of his existence". Unfortunately for him, the song is more famous than anything he ever did with his band.
</li><li> Nada Surf's "Popular" differs a lot from their other songs, for using spoken word verses excerpted from <em>Penny's Guide to Teen-Age Charm</em> and a sound more reminiscent of grunge rather than the power pop and indie rock that the is common in the band's discography.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Fincher</strong>: "Its a little glib to be a film. Lets hope we strove to get at something interesting, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">Social Network</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotSupposedToWinOscars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotSupposedToWinOscars">not earth-shattering</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zodiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zodiac">Zodiac</a> was about murders that changed America.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> considers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted">The Departed</a></em> to be one for him. For one thing it's set in contemporary America which he rarely tackles (he prefers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction">Historical Fiction</a> and period films and his last "contemporary" film before this was <em>Bringing Out The Dead</em>), secondly it deals with a milieu and city (Irish Mob and Boston) entirely different from his common territory (New York and the Italian Mob), and likewise deals largely with the police force and corruption (whereas he prefers dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>), in addition to having many shoot-outs and action scenes. In terms of narrative, Scorsese noted in his speech at the Oscars that, "It's the first film of mine with a plot" and noted many times that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotSupposedToWinOscars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotSupposedToWinOscars">It's Not Supposed to Win Oscars</a> and that he was surprised that it won.

Produced in 1982, when the studio was on the ropes and desperate to try <em>anything</em>, a live-action sci-fi film with heavy-duty religious themes and enough graphic violence to power a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">first person shooter</a> is definitely not what anyone expected out of The Mouse.

For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ALittleNightMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ALittleNightMusic">A Little Night Music</a></em>, his lightest work when he got to write the musicals he wanted (and that's not saying much, as it's basically Adultery: The Musical!), he wrote a song for the non-singer Glynis Johns to sing expressing her disappointment, using short phrases. It's a very simple song, but suddenly everyone began to cover it. Even now he refers to "Send in the Clowns" as his medley of greatest hits.

<ul><li> The now-defunct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel "foreverpandering" had a few videos of him ranting about terrible gaming channels. A popular series of his was just called "iJustine", where he took the piss out of iJustine's playthrough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>. The people who found these videos on his channel also found videos about other gaming channels that he thought were bad, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/ElectricalBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/ElectricalBeast">ElectricalBeast</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinecraftChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinecraftChick">Minecraft Chick</a>, so naturally people assumed that he uploaded videos like that regularly. They subscribed, only to find him uploading song covers and making rants about things that aren't gaming channels. He never made another gaming channel rant again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a> bills itself as a "Comedy Gaming Community," and most of its shows revolve around some form of that. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>, however, is an original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a> action show with no ties to any games (other than its own spinoffs) and at least as much drama as comedy (particularly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> kicks in). It's one of RT's two biggest hits (up there with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>), to the point where it's receiving a big-screen theatrical release.
</li><li> Vinny of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce">Vinesauce</a> does a wide variety of gaming-related streams, including traditional playthroughs of well-known games, peaks at obscure and often bizarre free games from the Internet, and reactions to new game trailers. His most famous videos, however, are his game corruption videos. This is despite him admitting that the sheer unpredictability of corruptions, while the source of their appeal, also makes it extremely hard to sift anything interesting out of them. Hence the dearth of such streams despite heavy viewer demand.
</li><li> 99% of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xFL1PPYx">xFL1PPYx<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s videos are guides and speculations pertaining to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em> series, that is except for the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_7Y9o3UAUw">Top 10 Worst Game Breaking Bugs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is a list of games in general that have nothing to do with <em>Saints Row</em>. It was his first video to reach a million views, and became his most viewed video on the website by far. Naturally, he made a second video of glitches he deemed to not make the first, but not out of obligation — he actually enjoys the subject.
</li><li> Actually, very common on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> in general. It's not uncommon for a channel's most popular video to be outside of their usual genre. Sometimes though many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a> YouTubers see this as a hint to change their channel to more of that kind of video to get more views and subscribers across the board. This usually fails spectacularly as not only are they not able to recapture the magic of their Black Sheep Hit but they often end up alienating their regular audience that was giving them consistent support on their original genre of videos. Or they do achieve success but no longer enjoy doing it as they traded following their passion for more views and subscribers.
<ul><li> It took 7 years for tech Youtube channel <em>Linus Tech Tips</em> to beat the previous biggest, which was a 7 minute 'live unboxing' and first look at a remote control toy firetruck, filmed back in 2011 back when the channel was still just a spin off of Canadian retailer NCIX's youtube channel. Yet it gained 11 million views. It was eventually dethroned in 2018 by a long video about building a PC from parts bought in a Chinese tech market.
