His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear.

</p><p>Sometimes, trying to set right what once went wrong is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">sets everything wrong in the first place</a>, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoRightsMakeAWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoRightsMakeAWrong">Two Rights Make a Wrong</a>. Succeeding would create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a> (i.e. if you do manage to set right what was wrong, you would have no reason to travel back in time in the first place, which means the wrongness would still be there, so you'd travel back in time, etc.) When the purpose of the time travel is to save a person (but not alter the timeline) by pulling the person out of time, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape">Time Travel Escape</a>. Stopping people before they commit the crimes often results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewilderingPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewilderingPunishment">Bewildering Punishment</a>.

Most notably, new people have probably been born in it who never existed in the original timeline. Will "fixing" the timeline cause these people to cease to exist? Note that in a "branching timelines" scenario, there is no danger of this because there is no way to unmake the bad present, only to create a better divergent branch off of it, or to find your way back to your original branch.
</p><p>Often the adventurer has to travel to fix things, combining this premise with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureTowns">Adventure Towns</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneratorGawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneratorGawl">Generator Gawl</a></em> seems to fall into this category, seeing how the only reason Auge was able to take over was because Gawl, Koji, and Ryu went back in time to stop them.

</li><li> An attempt at this is the driving force behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>. The series inverts the trope because changing history back to the way it was is the <em>bad guys</em>' plan, as the original timeline's world was utterly destroyed save one survivor, who was able to change history to create the Rave world. On top of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches">Clock Roach</a> out to undo the paradox involved, most of the late-story baddies want to see the "false" world destroyed.

The Time Shifters got scattered throughout history, changing the way certain historical events played out, and the Time Detectives have to capture them and put the past back the way it was.
</li><li> The final arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> reveals that this trope is the motivation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Leonard Testarossa</a> and his allies — their goal is to send the Whisperer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sophia, possessing the body of Kaname Chidori</span> 18 years backwards to prevent the Yamsk 11 incident from happening, which would change the world into one more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. The moment where it all breaks down is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Sousuke is apparently killed by Leonard and Sophia uses this to persuade Kaname, showing her a reality where Sousuke was an ordinary boy rather than a child soldier. At first Kaname seems happy, but she realizes that he's not the same Sousuke she fell in love with and rejects the plan, refusing to run away from reality even if it means living in a world where Sousuke is dead. Thankfully though, he isn't.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HenyokuNoLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HenyokuNoLabyrinth">Henyoku No Labyrinth</a></em>: Miyako only travels back in time to get together with her crush Hiroto who is the boyfriend of her sister. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She still fails because he still falls in love with her the first time they meet.</span>

</li><li> One of the arcs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurohime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurohime">Kurohime</a></em> involves two of the titled character's foes (Kurohime considered a bad guy in that world) going back in time to try killing her, for personal reason (revenge being the main motive, but also to keep the father of one of them being killed by her.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Its a bit of a twofer subvision. 1) They realize Kurohime not as evil as they figured and learn the reason behind her motives and 2) <em>They</em> wind up inadvertently causing the events that lead to the father's death. Kurohime wasn't even trying to kill him but took the blame anyway.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amakusa1637" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amakusa1637">Amakusa 1637</a> is built around this trope. Six schoolers from modern Kobe end up thrown in the Nagasaki of 1637, few before the failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseChristian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseChristian">Japanese Christian</a> rebellion of Shiro Amakusa; once they reunite and assess their situation, they decide to pull this trope to avert such tragedy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It works.</span>
</li><li> This is the story of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> film, <em>Tenchi Muyo in Love</em> - the creature KAIN had killed Tenchi's mom in 1976 and the gang has to go back to stop him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu">Touken Ranbu</a></em> adaptations run into this theme quite a bit, since they're fighting against forces that want to irrevocably change history for their own nefarious purposes:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ToukenRanbuHanamaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ToukenRanbuHanamaru">Touken Ranbu - Hanamaru</a></em>, the Sword Warriors are constantly reminding each other that this is <em>not a good thing</em>, and that no matter how much they cared for their previous masters, they need to <em>prevent</em> history from being changed by their enemies, not to change it themselves. And all of them can resist... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until one of them can't</span>.

However, before meeting him and explaining himself, he alters the event that made his parents meet and fall in love; his father remains a social outcast while his mother develops attraction towards him. Marty's eventual solution to this problem has the unexpected bonus of his father being more confident and assertive over Biff in 1985, leading to this trope in a roundabout way.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">second one</a> begins with Doc taking Marty to the future to stop his son from getting arrested. It also shows that due to Marty being overly sensitive to being called a coward, he wasn't living as good a future as he could. However, Marty is forced into a more extreme example of this trope shortly afterwards; he planned to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimelineAlteringMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimelineAlteringMacGuffin">sports almanac</a> back to the past with him to become filthy rich by predicting the wins accurately to the end of the century.

When Marty discovers the root of the problem, he has to go back in time to destroy the almanac.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">third movie</a> has Marty go back further in time to 1885; when lightning struck the time machine, Doc Brown was left stuck in the past, but sent a letter to Marty in the present to explain where and when he was, and that he was perfectly happy. Marty enlists the 1955 Doc to repair the time machine to get him back home, but they discover Doc's gravestone from less than a week after he mailed the letter, saying he was shot by Buford Tannen. Marty travels back to 1885 to save Doc, and in the end, he alters his own future by overcoming his own ego and the taunts of others, and Doc's by saving his life and getting him a lover.

Colter Stevens <em>tries</em> to prevent the train bombing he's repeatedly sent back to, until it's explained to him that he's only being sent into a virtual simulation of the event, and his mission is to identify the bomber so they can be arrested in the present, not to stop the bombing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colter eventually realises that the "simulation" is actually a bona fide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>, and manages to prevent the bombing in that timeline.</span> On top of that, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">contacts his family to give them closure about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">his death</a>, <em>and</em> contacts the scientist running the Source Code experiment to inform her of its true nature</span>.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em> is about a man who can communicate with his dead father through a family ham radio thanks to an Aurora Borealis that appeared in the same timespan between 1969 and current-day 1999. He uses this communication to save his father from his impending death in a warehouse fire, but that sets off a chain of events that lead to his mother's death, so the two work together to fix that, but then... et al.

However, the movie subverts this trope, as his every effort to save her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">causes her to die anyway from another cause</a>.

This has major repercussions in the future, which is now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> due to overpopulation, pollution, and bad politics, as well as disasters related to fusion power plant meltdowns (there was no fusion power in the original future timeline, as its inventor was destined to die in the subway crash). The reporter fails to prevent the next major disaster, as he's being chased by agents from the future, determined to keep him from changing anything else.

In this universe, time travel to the past is possible for a select few with the proper training. The main character in <em>Time and Again</em> goes back to 1912 in an attempt to prevent World War 1. He knows that there was a man who went to Europe to negotiate an agreement that could have prevented the war, but the agreement never made it back to the US. He later finds out that this was because the man and agreement went down with the <em>Titanic</em>. His next attempt is to prevent the ship from sinking.

In the original history, the lay preacher and religious fanatic Frank Gutchall murdered his wife using a Colt-.38 special that Allan's father Blake had loaned him. He claimed that he needed it to put his injured dog out of its misery. Remembering the original incident, Allan gives Gutchall his father's Luger after removing its firing pin. He then calls the police station, pretending to be his father, and tells them that Gutchall is planning to kill his wife. Gutchall is arrested and eventually committed. Allan saved Mrs. Gutchall's life as an experiment to determine whether the future could be altered.

<ul><li> One episode revolves around him trying to undo something he did by accidentally leaving his digital camera in the 70s. He returns home to find that computer technology is decades ahead of what it was (holographic screens and video-newspapers are commonplace), but his son was never born (he was delayed at work due to a computer error), replaced instead by a daughter who was conceived a few days later. Despite his wife's objections, he goes back and fixes it.
</li><li> The pilot episode gave a clever twist to the usual formula: Dan initially concludes that the reason he keeps jumping back in time is to prevent Neal Gaines from committing suicide, but in the end he realizes that his real purpose was to prevent him from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">committing murder.</span>

Although they promise not to change events, each of them can't resist meddling with their past to make it better. For instance one woman who knows her son will die of cancer starts giving him a potentially dangerous preventative drug — her husband, convinced she's going insane, cuts off her access to the boy. Another character bets on a football game — the size of his bet leads to other people betting on the outcome, starting rumors that adversely affect the course of the game. Worse, the group have considered the possibility that their own actions might advance in time, or even cause, the destruction of Earth.
</li><li> The short lived Fox show <em>Second Chance</em> has a man dying in a crash in 2011 and finding he's "not good enough for Heaven but not bad enough for Hell." To decide his eternal fate, he's sent back in time to 1987 and trying to keep his younger self from some major mistakes.
<ul><li> One episode has Charles realizing a friend is about to be killed in a drunk driving accident and getting his younger self, Chazz, to stop him from going out like that.
</li><li> Charles doesn't find anything wrong with how Chazz is constantly putting down a female classmate as a nerd. St. Peter (his angelic guide) brings Charles into the future to show how that treatment set the woman on a path to become a pathetic, single woman who's just been fired from her job at a diner. Charles gets Chazz to help the girl gain some self-confidence and even "glam up" for a date. St. Peter takes Charles back into the future to show the woman is now a strong, happily married mother who owns a chain of diners.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays">Seven Days</a></em> is entirely about this trope: a time machine allows a government agent to go seven days back in time in order to prevent the catastrophe of the week from taking place. Most episodes only deal with the time span of a week, due to the limitations of the time machine. However, several episodes involve the arrival of more advanced time machines from years in the future. In the first case, a time travel tries to stop a woman from developing a cure for cancer, which is going to mutate and start a pandemic. He succeeds but is killed himself. In another, a man arrives, claiming that a Muslim religious leader is secretly a radical, who will start the bloodiest religious war in history. It turns out the time traveler is himself a radical (or, possibly, someone not even human), who intends to kick-start just such a war by killing the imam.

Name dropped by Hiro in Season 5's "PassFail" during his all-in-his-coma-mind-trial, and Mental!Adam/Kensei rightfully points out that he's simply reciting the opening to <em>Quantum Leap</em>.

Normally it would turn out that actually she needed to learn a lesson from that event and her changes wouldn't help her life that much. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There were also a couple of episodes that varied from this format but stayed true to this theme. One where she was required to make changes to the life of the man sending her back in time, another where she managed to make a huge change in her life by stopping her brother's accidental death. This ended up to make her life drastically different and he still died but at a different time in his life and in a different way. Also, in another episode she had to travel forwards in time to learn about another time traveller's life as the version of him she knew in her present time was actually the past version of his actual self. He was refusing to make the changes he needed to and she had to convince him to make the changes he needed to and return to his own time.</span>

He succeeds in doing so but he changes history back, albeit very reluctantly, after Julia breaks up with him and Jeremy's life is ruined.

Due to a misunderstanding involving Wyatt helping Gary take off his bra, Gary's father Al and Wyatt's mother Marcia become convinced that their spouses are having an affair.

Invoking this trope is required to complete the game. Many other temporal tropes apply at various points in the game, but this trope pops up beautifully in a simple sidequest: a woman is mourning the death of her husband from sickness, saying "if only he'd taken this medicine...". To complete the sidequest, just travel back in time with the medicine and give it to the husband (saying it's from his wife).

You play a human cargo ship captain who is abducted by an alien race called the Hoods and given a timeship with the goal of stopping the hostile Microids from taking over the Echelon galaxy (except that they have already done that in this timeline) and moving on to the Milky Way. To this end, you are to seed four suitable planets with life and help the four different races evolve and deal with various crises. Your ship, the XTM, can go back 10,000 years into the past in 100 year increments. You also have access to the complete history of the four races that, unlike you, doesn't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">Ripple Effect-Proof Memory</a>. This means that, as soon as you change something, there is a temporal storm that updates the database right before your eyes. Essentially, you have 2 goals in the game: help the 4 races spread out throughout the Echelon galaxy in equal amounts (defeating the Microids) and have the 4 races reach the technological stage at which they can build replacement parts for your ship's wormhole drive to get back to Earth. Due to the game mechanics, you usually can only accomplish one of these.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, there is an alternate version of you, who has been recruited by the Microids to stop you. He will randomly show up at any point in the past to destroy one of the races, undoing all your hard work. You can't kill him, just as you yourself can't be killed.
</li><li> Interestingly, the creators originally planned to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> if you happen to have screwed up the history of the four races so much that it can't be fixed.

Henry goes through a bad day where he is constantly being hurt or pranked. After a battle with the titular bad guy, Henry goes back to the morning and has to relive the same day over again.

</li><li> Although it seems perfectly okay for them to change history in some cases but not in others. In one early episode, our heroes help a struggling musician make it to a gig which he had missed in the original timeline. He's convinced that had he not missed this gig, he'd be a star in the present. Turns out he's still a nobody even after they change history; the only difference is that he no longer blames himself for the breakup of his band. Since the change was so unimportant, our heroes are informed that what they did was okay.
</li><li> What the previous two events have in common is that the change prevented the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Imagin</a> from making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> with that person in the first place. While Singularity Points negate <em>some</em> of the damage caused by an Imagin to the past, they only negate damage to things that were part of their memory and some things are lost for good. So completely negating the rampage <em>better</em> preserves the timeline than simply destroying the Imagin in the past, even if it requires a minor change. Strangely, this <em>doesn't</em> negate the fact the Imagin was destroyed though...

Unfortunately, Gehn, who wrote quite a number of linking books, was not actually very good at writing them, so the same quantum-uncertainty mechanics are causing the Ages he wrote to deteriorate of their own accord. His son, Atrus, is much better at writing them, and thinks he can save some of them using these same quantum-uncertainty mechanics, but some are beyond salvaging. Your task is to go into one of the doomed ones to rescue Atrus' wife and capture Gehn to stop his shoddy linking book writing, while he stays and tries to stall its destruction for as long as possible.

<ul><li> This is the basic premise of <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, really. While we can't actually change what happened to OUR Draneor (getting corrupted and blown up into fragments called Outland) due to this being a parallel timeline...the expansion pretty much represents this for Draenor. Garrosh goes back to the moment his people were corrupted by demons and seeks to set that right by convincing them to take their own path; while it's a very noble concept at face value, Garrosh uses it to turn the orc clans into the Iron Horde and invade Azeroth anyway. The Draenei (Maraad especially) see going there as an opportunity to prevent what happened in our timeline from happening again. And indeed, our characters intervene at crucial moments to stop MANY bad events that happened on our Draenor from happening here.

This leads to all the trouble in the Temporal Cold War. The big problem is this: because of the events that lead to the Na'Khul's world being killed off, it lead to the unification of the major galactic powers and, ultimately, the creation of the Temporal Accords. To allow the Na'Khul to fix their homeworld would mean undoing all of this. Obviously, the Na'Khul don't care - they'll take the Federation down with them while doing this.

<ul><li> One race was given plans for a "zero point energy" generator, using the central black hole of the Milky Way as part of it, as a 'bribe' to suppress the invention of the Teraport.

</li></ul></li><li> So Kevyn, the "resident mad scientist" uses a wormgate, and some power from the core generator (which otherwise actually works), to go back to just before Tagons's mission, since that would give him enough time to stop (or otherwise influence) BOTH events. But the wormgate breaks apart after the trip back happens, so he can't repeat the trip if things go wrong again.

He accomplishes this by giving Cobain a tub of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbreakAndIceCream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbreakAndIceCream">Haagen Daaz Ice Cream</a>; Cobain survived until at least 2012, though he gained some weight.
</li><li> And in the episode "Christmas Guy" Stewie did this in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save Brian from getting hit by a car.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a>!</em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> that featured a Ghost of Christmas Past trying to pull <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol">Yet Another Christmas Carol</a> on Stan but he uses the opportunity trying to "fix" Christmas by killing Jane Fonda. His guardian angel stops him, but when they get back to modern times America is under the control of Soviet Russia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nyp7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1nyp7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nyp7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Stan also got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> off drugs, which meant no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver">Taxi Driver</a></em>, which meant John Hinkley Jr. didn't try to shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, which meant Walter Mondale gets elected President and immediately surrendered to the USSR.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In a bit of a subversion, trying to fix the original event by making <em>Taxi Driver</em> doesn't work, so Stan is forced to shoot Reagan himself (which much to his relief is told he just has to "wing him") to fix the timeline.</span> Note that even in the end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">the timeline isn't the same</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Since Stan only shot Reagan, his assistant James Brady was fine which meant no Brady Bill and thus America has less strict gun laws.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a>,</em> this is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Bart</a> came back from the future: in forty years, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Reach</span> managed to take over the world with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">moded</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blue Beetle</span>—hence why Bart specifically cozies up to that character. A side mission was stopping his grandfather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, from being killed by Neutron, whom he also saves from decades of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, a two-part episode involves the Justice League being trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Present</a> created when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> sent a computer back to his past self, giving him the information he needed to depose Hitler and assume control of the Nazis, allowing him to conquer the world. So, naturally, the Justice League have to travel through time themselves to topple Vandal Savage and prevent this from coming to be. Incidentally, the fact that this episode ended with Hitler's impending restoration to power elicited such a massive case of realized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> — that the heroes had implicitly <em>restored the Holocaust</em> to prevent Vandal's present-era regime — that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">the directors publicly announced</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">that Vandal's usurpation and cryogenic freezing, combined with when Hitler was released, meant that whilst Hitler went on to lead the Nazis to defeat, he had neither the time nor the resources to spare in directing the Holocaust</a>.
</li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> where Artie Ziff asks Marge to re-create their original prom date so he can end the evening properly as compared to the first instance in high school. Homer sees them dancing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">concludes</a>, "If Marge and Artie get married, I'll never be born!"
</li><li> The whole plot to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> season 5 finale, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E25TheCutieRemarkPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E25TheCutieRemarkPart1">The Cutie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E26TheCutieRemarkPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E26TheCutieRemarkPart2">Remark</a>". Starlight Glimmer discovers and refines a time travel spell that Starswirl the Bearded had made and uses it in a mad revenge scheme to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">stop the Sonic Rainboom and prevent the Mane Six from uniting</a>. Twilight Sparkle and Spike are stuck in a strange timeloop where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> when they try to use force to stop Starlight in this plot. Ultimately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">Twilight stops fighting and grabs Starlight to the next timeloop</a> which ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">breaking her badly</a>.
<ul><li> Also the plot of the earlier episode, "It's About Time". Twilight gets visited by a future version who looks like she comes from a warzone, but never learns why (because she keeps interrupting her future self with irrelevant questions) and has to figure out what's going to go wrong and prevent it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, it turns out nothing bad happened at all, and she worried herself sick the whole week for nothing. So she goes back in time to tell her past self not to get worried unnecessarily...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em> the Earth gets invaded by Triceratons who use a Black Hole Generator to destroy the planet. At the last second the turtles are saved by the Fugitoid, who takes them six months into the past to save Earth. He points out that this is the only chance they are going to get and won't be able to time travel again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: The plot of Episode 75 had Kaeloo, Stumpy and Mr. Cat use their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">go back to the series pilot</a> and prevent Quack Quack from getting addicted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug">yogurt.</a> Unfortunately, Stumpy ignores a warning from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Mr. Cat</a> telling him not to mess with the past, and he gives his past self information about what the future entails. When they return to the present, Stumpy is the king of Smileyland.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero</a></em>: In "Back to the Past of Future Balls", the part-time heroes revisit the world they visited in "Balls!" and find out Rippen used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a> to create a bad timeline where he took over. Penn and the time machine's inventor try to use it to undo the changes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They instead go back further in time and prevent the incident that started the war Rippen took advantage of in the first place.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> has Omi planning to travel to the past to prevent Hannibal Bean from turning Chase Young evil. However, in doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">he mostly messes things up</a>, like creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> where Jack Spicer rules the world and a present where Hannibal turns Master Monk Guan evil, Wuya is brought back to her human form with her powers and Master Fung is sent to the Yin Yang World.
