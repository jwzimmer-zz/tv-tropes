Yes, <em>Law &amp; Order</em> did this so frequently that it rates a separate section.
<p></p><h2>The Mothership</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> Season 1, episode 2: "Subterranean Homeboy Blues." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender flips</a> the Bernhard Goetz case, (the shooter in the show is a female), but makes few other changes to the real-life case.
</li><li> Season 1, episode 9: "Indifference" is so obviously inspired by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Steinberg">Lisa Steinberg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> case that it concludes with a long disclaimer both displayed and spoken about how the real case differed from the story just shown. It is easily the creepiest moment of the entire series considering they used the same title sequence narrator to tell the audience that the horrific case and the depraved criminals involved have some basis in real life.
</li><li> Season 1, episode 11: "Out of the Half-Light", an episode which fictionalized the then-unresolved <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawana_Brawley_rape_allegations">Tawana Brawley scandal/hoax.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 2, episode 1: "Confession" has some similarities to the case of Oreste Fulminante, whose confession to murder was found to be coerced.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 2: "Wages of Love" shows similarities to the Betty Broderick case.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 5: "God Bless This Child" may have been based on the Alex Dale Morris faith-healing case.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 7: "In Memory Of." Based on the case of George Franklin.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 8: "Out of Control". Based on a rape case at St. John's University.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 9: "Renunciation" was based on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Smart">Pamela Smart<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> case.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 10: "Heaven" was heavily based on the Happy Land Fire. Both the fictional case and the real one it was based on involved a jealous boyfriend burning his ex-girlfriend's club, and the fictional episode added an organized crime conspiracy element to the story.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 11: "His Hour on the Stage" was based on the Roy Radin murder.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 15: "Severance" may have been based in part on the case of Donald Nash.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 16: "Vengeance" was possibly based on the Boston Strangler.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 19: "The Fertile Fields", which may have been inspired in part by the Crown Heights riots.
</li><li> Season 2, episode 20: "Intolerance" was based on Wanda Holloway, who hired a hitman to kill her daughter's rival in a school competition.
</li><li> Season 3, episode 2: "Conspiracy". Originally based on the assassinations of several civil rights leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers, and Malcolm X. The sequel episode (season 7, episode 9, <em>Entrapment</em>) made it specifically about the Malcolm X shooting.
</li><li> Season 3, episode 3: "Forgiveness", which was based on Bonnie Garland's murder.
</li><li> Season 3, episode 12: "Extended Family", based on what happened to Faye Yager.
</li><li> Season 3, episode 15: "Night and Fog", about the Nazi John Demjanjuk (called 'Ivan the Terrible').
</li><li> Season 3, episode 17: "Conduct Unbecoming", which referenced the Tailhook scandal.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 1: "Sweeps". Based on an episode of Geraldo that erupted into a brawl.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 5: "Black Tie." Based on the Sunny Von Bulow case.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 7: "Apocrypha". Based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a> cult.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 8: "American Dream". Based on the Billionaire Boys Club scandal.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 14: "Censure" was based on the case of Judge Solomon Wachtler.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 17: "Mayhem" was inspired in part by Lorena Bobbitt's mutilation of her husband.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 18: "Wager" was based on James Jordan's gambling problems (James Jordan was Michael Jordan's father).
</li><li> Season 4, episode 19: "Sanctuary" was based on the Crown Heights riots.
</li><li> Season 4, episode 21: "Doubles". Based on the attacks on sports stars Nancy Kerrigan and Monica Seles.
</li><li> Season 5, episode 1: "Second Opinion." Opens with an incident based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Ramirez">Gloria Ramirez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> before diving into the peddling of phony cancer medication such as Laetrile.
</li><li> Season 6, episode 13: "Charm City" (also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide</a> crossover). Based on the Aum Shinrikyo subway attack.
</li><li> Season 7, episode 13: "Matrimony", which featured yet another blond bombshell being investigated for the murder of her octogenarian millionaire husband.
</li><li> Season 7, episodes 15-17: "D-Girl", "Turnaround", and "Showtime" — based on the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OJSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OJSimpson">OJ Simpson</a> trial, which was such a circus that naturally it needed to be a three-part epic. Notably, the OJ stand-in and his dead wife were white, eliminating the racial angle. <em>Every</em> other beat of the real trial was mirrored... until the jury found the guy guilty, that is.
</li><li> Season 8, episode 1: "Thrill" — an episode where two teenagers order take out, just so they can get the thrill of killing the delivery guys — was based on a real event, just replace the fried chicken with pizza.
</li><li> Season 8, episode 2: "Denial" — about a college-age couple that denies killing their newborn baby. Based on the Melissa Drexler and Amy Grossberg cases, in which young parents dump their babies in dumpsters.
</li><li> Season 8, episode 15: "Faccia a Faccia" - about a murdered former hitman who'd turned states evidence and published a book about his life in the mob. Heavily inspired by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Gravano">Sammy "The Bull" Gravano<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Season 9, episode 5: "Agony" - has a serial killer suspected of numerous murders in several states, reminiscent of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy">Ted Bundy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Season 10, episode 1: "Gunshow" - was mostly based on the Ecole Polytechnique shooting in Canada, as the victims were female students and the shooter was inspired by hatred of women and attempted to kill himself as well. It also involves then-current topics in the gun control debate, like sales loopholes. (Of course, where the incident actually happened, there <em>isn't</em> as much of a gun culture to begin with and there was an almost immediate crackdown after the shooting. But that's not as interesting as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> hauling a gun company CEO in on manslaughter charges</span>.)
</li><li> Season 10, episode 2: "Killerz" - disturbingly based on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger">murder of James Bulger,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but with the perps as girls. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> adapted the episode around the time Bulger's killers were up for parole, renewing national interest in the case.
<ul><li> Can also be seen as having been inspired by the case of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell">Mary Bell.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Season 10, episode 24: "Vaya Con Dios" - heavily inspired by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_and_arrest_of_Augusto_Pinochet">the arrest and trial of Augusto Pinochet for human rights violations.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 11, Episode 11: "Sunday in the Park with Jorge," based in part on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Day_Parade_attacks">the 2000 Puerto Rican Day Parade attacks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> as community leaders weren't happy with the general portrayal of Puerto Ricans on the show and pushed back against NBC hard.
</li><li> Season 11, episode 22: "School Daze" - based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine High School Massacre</a>.
</li><li> Season 11, episode 24: "Deep Vote" - takes the 2000 election recounts, applies them to a senatorial election, and gets the mob involved.
</li><li> Season 12, episode 1: "Who Let the Dogs Out?" - based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Whipple">the death of Diane Whipple.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 12, episode 6: "Formerly Famous" - based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blake_(actor)">the Robert Blake case.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 13, episode 3: "True Crime" combined Courtney Love's coked-up exploits, Kurt Cobain's <strike>murder</strike> suicide, and the Dave Mustaine/Metallica split (with a layer of The Beatles/Yoko Ono thrown in for good measure).
</li><li> Season 13, episode 15: "Bitch" - based on Martha Stewart's insider trading scandal.
</li><li> Season 13, episode 24: "Smoke" took the infamous 2002 "Michael Jackson dangles his baby out of a hotel window" incident to its (il)logical extreme; a famous eccentric celebrity dangles his young son out a window... <em>AND DROPS HIM</em>! Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sting">Sting</a>. From there, the story reaches further back to the 1993 child molestation allegations brought against Jackson by Jordan Chandler and the out-of-court settlement he reached with the boy and his family.
</li><li> Season 14, episode 5: "Blaze" was based on the Station nightclub fire.
</li><li> Season 14, episode 21: "Vendetta" was based on Steve Bartman, who caught a ball at a baseball game that an outfielder could have caught and thus supposedly cost the Chicago Cubs their trip to the World Series.
</li><li> Season 15, episode 11: "Fixed" was based on Joel Steinberg's release from prison and thus serves as a sequel to "Indifference".
</li><li> Season 15, episode 16: "The Sixth Man" was based on the infamous Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons brawl that started when Ron Artest entered the stands. In this ep, the Artest stand-in is accused of the murder of the guy he went into the stands to fight after said fan sued him.
</li><li> Season 15, episode 24: "Locomotion" was based on the Glendale train crash caused by a man attempting suicide by parking his car on the tracks
</li><li> Season 16, episode 4: "Age of Innocence" was clearly based on the Terri Schiavo case. Guess which side got to be the murderers? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you guessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">those wacky, fanatical Christians</a> - you're right.</span>
</li><li> Season 16, episode 20: "Kingmaker" involved a variation of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_plame#.22Plamegate.22">Valerie Plame<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> outing, although with the politics reversed: the target of the outing of his daughter as a covert undercover agent was a Republican politician, and the political operative responsible for the outing was a ruthless, vicious, scary Democrat.
</li><li> Season 17, episode 7: "In Vino Veritas", which, like the Michael Jackson example above, was about taking a celebrity scandal and cranking it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, with Mel Gibson's DUI arrest and following anti-Semitic rant (reenacted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency">Chevy Chase</a></em>, of all people) giving way to a murder confession.
</li><li> Season 17, episode 11: "Remains of the Day", about the death of Anna Nicole Smith's son.
</li><li> Season 17, episode 22: "The Family Hour", about Judge Larry Seldin's antics at Anna Nicole Smith's custody trial. It also became meta and referenced the Andrea Yates trial. A forensic psychologist testified that Yates' testimony was cribbed from a <em>Law and Order</em> episode; there was no such episode. In "The Family Hour," Rodgers makes a similar mistake on the stand.
</li><li> Season 18, episode 4: "Bottomless" used this trope three times (Wal-Mart ethics enforcement, Chinese quality control scandals, and Roy Pearson's multi-million dollar lawsuit over being given the wrong pair of pants by his dry cleaners) in one vaguely-coherent 44-minute episode.
</li><li> Season 18, episode 15: "Bogeyman" referenced the Scientology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">paranoia fueled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicides</a> of a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/01/suicides200801">prominent New York artist couple<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (you've seen the husband's artwork if you saw the trailer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PunchDrunkLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PunchDrunkLove">Punch-Drunk Love</a></em> or Beck's <em>Sea Change</em> album). Notable in the fact that Assist. DA Cutter pretends to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">expy-Scientologist</a> as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>; sadly, the expy-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickName">Scilons</a> have yet to return. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uomw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uomw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uomw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Scientologists' harassment tactic isn't meant to drive their victim(s) to suicide, just away from investigating Scientology. Going crazy and being committed (the ultimate hell for the psychiatry-loathing Scientologists) or broke from filing libel suits is just a bonus.</span>
</li><li> Season 20, episode 4: "Reality Bites" combines conspicuous references to the Octomom, Kate and Jon Gosselin, and the Dugger family in a mess of reality-TV motivated familial drama.
</li><li> Season 20, episode 5: "Dignity" was based on the murder of abortion doctor George Tiller.
</li><li> Season 20, episode 6: "Human Flesh Search Engine" managed the bizarre feat of being based both on the death of David Carradine and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>.
</li><li> Season 20, episode 11: "FED". A somewhat bizarre application of this trope; this episode combined the murder of a census worker who had the word 'FED' scrawled on his body with the ACORN videos showing ACORN members advising people how to commit voter fraud. In real life, both stories were hoaxes — the census worker's death was actually a suicide, and the ACORN videos were found to be heavily doctored.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> pulled a trifecta when they combined Rhianna's physical abuse, "sexting" (teens sending nude pics over their cellphones), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a scandal about two judges who'd send kids with very minor offenses to private juvenile facilities for cash (basically <strike><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes">Holes</a></em> if Stanley's judge was getting paid for each kid he sent to Camp Green Lake)</strike> Sunlight Home from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman">The Talisman</a></em></span>.

</li><li> Another trifecta: "Babes", an episode in the 10th season of SVU, had a group of high school students making a pregnancy pact in order to emulate a movie they had seen, a mother apparently bullying her daughter's classmate into committing suicide via an online networking site AND a group of kids filming homeless people being beaten and then uploading the footage onto the internet, all of which closely resemble real-life news stories.
</li><li> ANOTHER trifecta: "Blood Brothers", from season 13 of SVU, managed to combine the Arnold Schwarzenegger love child scandal (though in the episode, it was just a politician, not an actor as well, but it kept most of the details, including his wife and his housekeeper both giving birth to his sons in the same month), unfair placement on the sex offender registry (in this case, two teenagers having sex and the slightly older boy is put on the registry), and the marriage of Prince William to Kate Middleton, of all things. If you include teen pregnancy, given the popularity of shows like 16 &amp; Pregnant, this episode might count as a quadruple use of this trope.
</li><li> Similarly, another episode of L&amp;O: SVU dealt with a famous person advocating against psychiatric drugs, and the disastrous effects when someone with a mental disorder listens to him (this character wasn't a Happyologist, it was just his personal opinion - and due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">having received electroshock therapy when he was a teenager</a>).
</li><li> SVU episode <em>"Torch"</em> covers the case of Texas man <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham">Cameron Todd Willingham<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was executed early in the century, though evidence supports his potential innocence, for burning his house down with his daughters in it. Both cases featured issues raised with investigating arson, a smug, WRONG arson investigator, a former nuclear weapons expert turned arson investigator, the concept of flashover, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">unlikeable prosecutor</a>. The SVU version notably features the innocent man being acquitted before he died, the prosecutor correctly pursuing justice, no <a class="urllink" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/01/texas.execution.probe/index.html">interference from Texas governor Rick Perry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and no New Yorker coverage. This case is currently major in the debate about the death penalty, as it was the first known incident of an innocent Texan being executed.
</li><li> The episode "As Nature Made Him" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> used the story of the twin boy forced to live as a girl after a botched circumcision. In the episode, the non-altered twin was charged with a crime based on the evidence that indicated there had been a young boy at the scene. Altered-twin eventually fessed up after being hit with the news that 'she' used to be male.
<ul><li> The episode title is also the title of the book written about the real-life case.
</li></ul></li><li> The first half of season 8 episode "Haystack" is based on the Melinda Duckett case, except that in the episode the little boy was found by firefighters. As of this writing, Trenton Duckett has yet to be found.
</li><li> The Season 13 episode "Lost Traveler", about a Romani boy who disappeared on his way home from school, combines the murders of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Leiby_Kletzky">Leiby Klezky<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger">James Bulger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal">News International phone hacking scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There are also some similarities to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etan_Patz">Etan Patz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> case, although this one was actually reopened one year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">after</a> the episode aired.
</li><li> The season 14 episode, "25 Acts", is inspired by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em> media craze. In it, the author gets brutally raped by a TV host who interviewed her.
</li><li> The Season 5 episode "Lowdown" discusses the phenomenon of "being on the down low" in the African-American community, in which supposedly masculine black men secretly have sex with other men but claim that they're still straight. In the episode, a Bronx D.A. (who is Benson's ex-boyfriend) is found dead in his car, and clues lead to his male coworker, who he was in a secret sexual relationship with. Fin actually details what the term "down-low" means to the rest of the squad. It also addresses the theory that black men on the down low is the reason for the high rate of HIV in black women, by having said coworker also give his wife HIV.
</li><li> The season 9 episode "Authority" was loosely based on the same series of crimes that inspired the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Compliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Compliance">Compliance</a></em>, mentioned below under Film.
</li><li> The season 14 episode "Vanity's Bonfire" is based on the John Edwards sex scandal, in which 2008 presidential candidate John Edwards cheated on his cancer-stricken wife and got his mistress pregnant, then convinced one of his aides to claim the baby as his.
</li><li> The season 14 episode "Lessons Learned" is based on the Penn State University sex scandal, in which former coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of molesting several boys and the school was criticized for covering it up.
</li><li> The season 14 episode "Funny Valentine" is based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> domestic violence incident, and even had lookalike actors playing the singers. A scene at the end threw in a News report with a line about she 'fell off of a boat' and died, no doubt to reference the renewed coverage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatalieWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatalieWood">Natalie Wood</a>'s death and rumors that she may have been murdered.
</li><li> Season 16's "Intimidation Game", which conflates the GamerGate controversies of late 2014 with, of all things, ISIS terrorist activity and kidnappings. This episode is infamous for drawing the ire of both sides of the debate. Not least of which was because the episode treated the terrorist gamers as being unable to separate the games from reality (including the POV of the would-be killer having a <em>HUD</em>), when previous episodes that dealt with gaming and violence went out of their way to say no, video games don't make you a deluded killer.
</li><li> Other prominent ripped-from-the-headlines episodes over the years feature: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ng">Charles Ng's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> rape and murder spree and extradition proceedings from Canada (Season 2, "Manhunt"); the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Louima">Abner Louima assault<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Season 4, "Rotten"); the renewed child molestation allegations against Michael Jackson (Season 5, "Sick"); the case of a British teacher who <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2345971.stm">claimed a brain tumor drove him to pedophilia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Season 5, "Head"); and the side effects of using <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefloquine">Mefloquine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to treat malaria in soldiers deployed in Iraq (Season 6, "Goliath")
</li><li> Season 13, Episode 15 "Hunting Ground", about a man who hunts and kills prostitutes and buries their bodies on a local beach: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hansen">Robert Hansen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the still-unidentified <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer">Long Island Serial Killer.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 15, Episode 2 "Imprisoned Lives" very clearly ripped the Ariel Castro affair, with the (visibly disgusted) detectives commenting near the end that the suspect they caught would likely kill himself in prison (as Castro did only months before the episode aired).
</li><li> Season 15, Episode 3 "American Tragedy" managed to pull off another trifecta, combining the New York Police Department Stop-and-Frisk debacle, Paula Deen's racist comments scandal, and the Trayvon Martin case, by having a rich, white, Southern celebrity chef shoot an unarmed black teenager simply because of his race.
</li><li> "Pornstar's Requiem" in season 16 revolves around a character based on Belle Knox, the Duke pornstar.
</li><li> The season 16 episode, "Glasgowman's Wrath," is about two girls who stabbed their friend in order to lure out the mythical Glasgowman. It was very blatantly ripped from the story of two girls who tried to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2646432/12-year-old-Wisconsin-girls-stab-friend-19-times.html">murder their friend in the hopes of summoning Slenderman.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 16, Episode 18 "Devastating Story" is based on the discredited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone">Rolling Stone</a></em> story alleging a culture of fraternity-driven rape at the University of Virginia.
</li><li> The 100th episode, "Control", is based on the story of John Jamelske, who spent five years kidnapping women of varying ages and ethnicities and holding them prisoner in his home for varying intervals (several years for some, several months for others) before eventually releasing them. Unlike the real-life case, where Jamelske was eventually caught and arrested, the twist came when the perp in question was murdered by one of his victims when she encountered him on the subway sometime after her release.
</li><li> Season 15, episode 6 "October Surprise" combines the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal with a little bit of the John Edwards out of wedlock baby scandal (in which he had a baby with his mistress, made one of his aides claim the baby, and used presidential campaign funds to cover it up). In this episode, ADA Barba's childhood friend and mayoral candidate Alex Munoz is found to have various mistresses which he met online. The SVU finds this out when one of the mistresses threatens to talk and Munoz's aide (and childhood friend) Eddie is sent to keep her quiet, during which she accuses him of rape. When he is questioned, Eddie claims that she's his girlfriend and they had a disagreement. Later on, it's revealed that Munoz bribes his mistresses to keep quiet, in extreme cases fraudulently getting them high paying government jobs.
</li><li> Pole vaulter Jenna Miller from the season 15 episode, "Heightened Emotions", was based on Olympic long-distance runner <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzy_Favor_Hamilton">Suzy Favor Hamilton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Season 18, Episode 17 "Real Fake News" is based on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, as well as Edgar Maddison Welch, a North Carolina man that traveled to the accused pizza place and fired a gun into it hoping to "rescue children".
</li><li> Season 19, Episode 20 "The Book of Esther" is based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpin_case">Turpin case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where a couple spent several years abusing their 13 children. The family's visit to a bowling alley wearing numbered jumpers and subsequent photoshoot replicates a photo of the Turpin family wearing numbered shirts based on Thing One and Thing Two from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em>.
</li><li> The writers must have placed a challenge on themselves when they made Season 10, Episode 4 "Lunacy" which is apparently inspired by Buzz Aldrin punching Moon Landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel, of all things (the incident is directly referenced in the episode by the fictional version of Aldrin). Lisa Nowak's arrest is indirectly alluded to in another scene, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">precedent of astronaut-on-astronaut violence</a>.
</li><li> The writers are well aware of their reputation and exploit it rather than denying it. <em>Hours</em> after Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested in New York for the alleged sexual abuse of a hotel maid, it was announced that the show had already an outline for an upcoming episode based on the case, and it later went through several rewrites as the court case unfolded. It eventually became the Season 13 premiere "Scorched Earth", but instead of Strauss-Kahn, the suspect was an Italian diplomat that resembled Silvio Berlusconi.
</li><li> Season 20, Episode 3 "Zero Tolerance" is based on the 2018 immigration crisis where hundreds of families were torn apart and kids were locked up in detention centers, separated from their families.
</li><li> Season 21, Episode 3, "Down Low in Hell's Kitchen" largely tackles the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussie_Smollett_alleged_assault">Jussie Smollett hate crime allegations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a little bit of the arrest of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/us/ed-buck-federal-drug-indictment/index.html">Ed Buck<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for allegedly killing multiple gay black men via drug overdose. Unlike the real Smollett case, there is hard proof of someone targeting gay men, but the pop singer Mathis pretends to have been victimized in order to come out as gay before TMZ outs him.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Criminal Intent</h2>
<ul><li> In late 2006, <em>Criminal Intent</em> fictionalized the already-fictional character of the YouTube "celebrity" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Lonelygirl15" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> as "WeepingWillow17" and made her the victim of a kidnapping, and by the end it's as hard for the detectives to tell what's real and what isn't as it is for the viewers.
</li><li> Yet another <em>Criminal Intent</em> episode dramatized the John Mark Karr confession to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, for the first half hour at least. And come on, you <em>knew</em> the creepy neighbor had to have something to do with it. Bonus: The character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">Faith Yancy</a> makes another appearance.
</li><li> "Bombshell" was about Anna Nicole Smith's death. Her character was named Lorelei, after Marilyn Monroe's famous part.
</li><li> "Revolution" had a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> Madoff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a>, who confessed to his incredible scheme <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to get protection from the Colombian(?) gangsters he swindled</span>.
<ul><li> The original did this one too ("Anchors Away", season 19)
</li><li> The first episode of the final season featured Jay Mohr as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a> stand-in (who was a fashion mogul instead of an actor because they knew they had to change <em>something</em> to avoid getting sued). He turned out to be only tangentially related to the murder plot even though the advertisements focused entirely on his character.
</li></ul></li><li> The Season 3 episode "The Saint" (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCastingAgency">the one with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>) was based on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hofmann">Mark Hofmann<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> case, centering on a forger who targets a religion institution and uses a bomb to get rid of the person that could help to unravel his scheme.
</li><li> Another episode had an upcoming Broadway musical based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">the legend of Icarus</a> plagued by injuries on the set, culminating in the death of its lead actor when his rigging snapped and he fell during a stunt. This was based on the many problems surrounding the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark">Spider-Man musical</a>. Goren even compares the two shows at one point.
</li><li> In the episode "Poison", the plot is extremely close to the Stella Nickell case. Some minor differences were that in real life only one person (other than the killer's husband) died, there was no 'Angel of Death' to complicate matters, and Stella wanted to open up a fish store, instead of a baby clothing shop.
</li><li> "Smothered" is pretty closely based on what happened to Pati Margello. The step-father of her boyfriend, Dean MacGuigan hired hit men to kill her. This was with full knowledge and consent of Dean's mother, Lisa Moseley, heir to the DuPont fortune.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Other Shows in the Franchise</h2>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em>'s third season opened with an episode with a plot reminiscent of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger">murder of James Bulger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which had been rendered topical again by one of the murderers being arrested for child pornography offenses in early 2010 when the episode would've been written and filmed.
<ul><li> The show also occasionally tweaks episodes of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> to deal with this. The adaptation of "Promises to Keep" (focused on a psychiatrist whose relationship with a client crosses the line and results in the death of the client's pregnant fiance) moved the focus onto the patient, who reveals he was involved in a James Bulger-style murder as a child and is out on a life license under a new identity, like Bulger's killers would have been at the time.

Astro even gets told to move to the back of a bus.

<ul><li> Earlier on, during his reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>, Superman was to make his public debut by rescuing a space shuttle that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>, the only civilian there, was on. When the <em>Challenger</em> disaster occurred, claiming the lives of all crew (and the sole civilian, a woman) the shuttle was changed to a completely unrealistic "space plane".

<ul><li> A number of stories will occasionally make use of current events. This ranges from corporate fraud to slavery to even the then ongoing War on Terror. Usually so writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Garth Ennis, can give us his opinion on the matter</a>.
</li><li> In particular, The Slavers appears to be based on The Guardian article "Streets of Despair", with Garth Ennis even basing scenes on real-life moments transcribed in the article, including direct quotes, and even using the same names of the interviewees (which, as the article notes, were changed for their protection).
</li></ul></li><li> Superhero comics got a nasty shock when the September 11, 2001 attacks happened, as these attacks actually sound a lot like a comic book plot. DC and Marvel had a rather hard time figuring out how to address 9/11 properly in universes in which gods, aliens, giant robots, and supervillains with otherworldly powers and weapons of mass destruction terrorize American citizens, <em>especially</em> New Yorkers, with death and mayhem on a rather regular basis.
<ul><li> Marvel put out several specials, the proceeds of which went to 9/11-related charities, and this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> multiple times, ESPECIALLY with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, and handled in a rather realistic (for the setting) fashion. When addressed directly, it was either a case of "so busy with giant gaudy supervillains, 13 separated plain-clothed men slipped by unnoticed", or they basically said "We'll figure out who to blame later and deal with the tragedy now!" or, in at least Spider-Man's case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">he spent a long while with no answer to the question, no excuse, no reason at all.</a>
</li><li> Slightly more cynical readers might point out that the Twin Towers were destroyed multiple times in Marvel Comics, often by the same villains shown crying in the aforementioned Spider-Man issue.
<ul><li> Marvel published the Crisis Crossover <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> a short time later, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyConflictCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyConflictCounterpart">Fantasy Conflict Counterpart</a> of the 9/11 and the consequences of it. It had the "How would it have impacted in the superhero community?" angle, which would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">completely out of place</a> if done with the real event.
</li></ul></li><li> DC put out four volumes of anthologies: <em>9-11: Artists Respond</em>, <em>9-11: The World's Finest Comic Book Writers &amp; Artists Tell Stories to Remember</em>, <em>9-11: Emergency Relief</em> and <em>A Moment of Silence</em>, stories showing their heroes dealing with the tragedy. A particularly strong story, which also managed to avoid the logic gaffes from the above-mentioned Marvel reactions, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Static" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Static">Static</a></em> entry in the second volume. Rather than dealing with the destruction of the Twin Towers themselves, the story instead focused on the backlash against innocent Muslims that began once people started blaming them for 9/11. Several of the other stories also had this theme and reminded readers that people of all faiths, Muslims included, died in the attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin">Tintin</a></em> did this constantly in the first periodic strips published in the 1930s, to the point that modern readers might fail to get what were at the time obvious references to world events. The situation changed after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> invaded Belgium and direct commentary on those world events became... unwise. Hergé spent the war writing more light-hearted stories with no political commentary, and after the war, many of the 1930s strips were re-released in book form with the more swallow references (like to popular 1930s films and actors) deleted.
<ul><li> The early <em>Tintin in America</em> (1931-1932) has Tintin go to Chicago to bring down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>, the only time he has a real person as an antagonist.
</li><li> <em>Cigars of the Pharaoh</em> (1932-1934) is inspired by the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb and the post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> wars in the Middle East that shaped Saudi Arabia's borders as they are today. While adrift at the Red Sea, Tintin is saved by a then famous French mercenary/smuggler that operated in the area.
</li><li> <em>The Blue Lotus</em> (1934-1935) has Tintin stumble on a Japanese plot to stage a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> blowing up the Shanghai-Nanking railway as a pretext to invade China. This is an obvious jab at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Mukden Incident</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Broken Ear</em> (1935-1937) is based on the Chaco War, and features an international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a> modeled on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Zaharoff">Basil Zaharoff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em>King Ottokar's Sceptre</em> (1938-1939) is inspired both by the German annexation of Austria and the Italian invasion of Albania.
</li><li> <em>Land of Black Gold</em> (1939-1940) was originally set in the British Mandate of Palestine and dealt with Irgun insurgency. Publication was cancelled before the ending because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and when it was due to be resumed in 1948 it was deemed obsolete. The story was edited heavily and released as set in a fictional Arab country torn by civil war.

<ul><li> One issue involved a new "Hacktivist" inspired version of U.S. Agent who had leaked a bunch of sensitive documents to the public.

<ul><li> Ibáñez rarely did this during the Silver Age (early '80s). It wasn't until the 90s (let's be generous and say late 80s) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> was referenced in the comics (either as celebrity cameos or as stories based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> events, and until the XXI century that it played a big role in them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> storyline "Mega-City Confidential" is a clear commentary on the NSA/GCHQ surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden. Crucially, even Dredd feels that Justice Department's spying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">is going too far</a>.
<ul><li> An earlier story mocked the divorce of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman through a war between two blocks named after the actors.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a> story "The Bribe!" (<em>Shock SuspenStories</em> #7) is loosely based on the story of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire. The Cocoanut Grove passed a fire safety inspection eight days before it burned down, causing hundreds of deaths; that the nightclub's owners had bribed the inspectors, as in EC's story, was alleged but never proven. The identification of the victims by pictures taken by a club photographer shortly before the fire broke out is another element of the story that actually happened.

It came out in the months leading to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and has Filthy Rich running against Mayor Mare for mayor of Ponyville. Filthy, a wealthy business pony with no prior political experience, can be seen in this as a loose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>.

It came out in 2012 when an increasing number of American states were legalizing same-sex marriage; this was Marvel's extremely unsubtle way of voicing their support. The problem is that Kyle is just a minor character whose relationship with Northstar—himself just an on-and-off member of the X-Men—mostly developed off-panel. For them to have the full-blown "Superhero Wedding" treatment would have made no sense if Kyle were Kylie instead.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericaVsTheJusticeSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericaVsTheJusticeSociety">America vs. the Justice Society</a>,</em> which revolved around the discovery of a (false) diary implicating the Golden Age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a> as Nazi collaborators, was inspired by the discovery and publication of the so-called Hitler Diaries.

It <em>claims</em> to be based on actual events, but in reality it's not even loosely based on anything that actually happened. Though the scene with the wood chipper being used to dispose of the body was inspired by what happened to murder victim Helle Crafts, except it was her husband who forced her body through the wood chipper. That case was the first one in Connecticut where a murder conviction was secured without a body (because only several ounces of body was ever recovered).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangmenAlsoDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangmenAlsoDie">Hangmen Also Die!</a></em> revolves around the aftermath of the assassination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ReinhardHeydrich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ReinhardHeydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>. The assassination was carried out on May 27, 1942 (though he didn't die of his injuries until June 4). The film was released on March 27, 1943 — less than a year later.

<div class="indent"><strong>George Miller</strong>: I remember it really stuck in my mind, in a very peaceful city like Melbourne, our southern capital, or some city, it took ten days after a severe oil shortage for the first shot to be fired. And I thought, what if it went on? That was one of the things when we did the first <em>Mad Max</em>.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>James McCausland</strong>: Yet there were further signs of the desperate measures individuals would take to ensure mobility. A couple of oil strikes that hit many pumps revealed the ferocity with which Australians would defend their right to fill a tank. Long queues formed at the stations with petrol — and anyone who tried to sneak ahead in the queue met raw violence.
</div><div class="indent">George and I wrote the script based on the thesis that people would do almost anything to keep vehicles moving and the assumption that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyDependentSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyDependentSociety">nations would not consider the huge costs of providing infrastructure for alternative energy until it was too late</a>.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Network">Network</a></em> took inspiration from two news events of the mid-1970s: the on-air suicide of newscaster Christine Chubbuck, and the terrorist activities of the Symbionese Liberation Army.
</li><li> Before all the car chases and explosions happen, the cult in <em>Never Say Die</em> instigates a mass suicide similar to the one instigated by the People's Temple in Jonestown, Guyana.

The film can be seen as a subversion of this trope, as the real-life incident is more brutal than what is depicted on film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orphan">Orphan</a></em>: It's about an American family who adopts Esther, a 9-year-old Russian girl, who's in reality <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a thirty-three-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">psycho</a> who suffers from a disease that makes her seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">younger than she actually is</a></span>.

</li><li> Almost every film in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky">Rocky</a></em> series is influenced by events from real life boxing. Sometimes the incidents are very recent, sometimes they happened a long time earlier.
<ul><li> <strong>Real life:</strong> A journeyman boxer named Chuck Wepner (who has never made enough money from the game to train full time for a bout) gets picked for a fight against controversial, charismatic, and overconfident champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a>. Wepner shocks audiences when he makes it to the 15th round against the champion, scoring a disputed knockdown along the way, but is finally stopped by Ali in the last round.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocky">Rocky</a>:</strong> Rocky Balboa, a journeyman boxer who has never made much money in the game (to the point where his main job is a mafia debt collector) gets picked to fight against controversial, charismatic, and overconfident champion Apollo Creed. Rocky immediately does better than expected, knocking Creed down in round 1, Creed almost knocks Rocky out in the next to last round, and wins a close decision victory.
</li><li> <strong>Real life:</strong> Joe Frazier, a tough boxer from Philadelphia who was famous for his left hook, did his roadwork in the city (including the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art) and used meat carcasses as makeshift punching bags, reached the pinnacle of his career with a victory over the quick, brash and charismatic Muhammad Ali. After a few defenses against less than stellar opposition that was clearly outclassed by him, Frazier then faced the hard-hitting (but relatively unheralded) George Foreman, and was knocked out in two rounds. A year later Foreman faced Ali, and in that bout Ali made a tactical decision mid-fight to stop using the Hit-and-Run Tactics he was famous for, and instead adopted the rope-a-dope strategy of lying on the ropes, blocking, parrying, and in some cases absorbing all the punishment Foreman could dish out and more, taunting Foreman all the while for Foreman's inability to knock Ali out. Foreman exhausted himself trying to KO Ali, and Ali then knocks him out.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII">Rocky III</a>:</strong> Rocky Balboa, a tough boxer from Philadelphia famous for his left hook who does his roadwork in the city (including the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art) and uses meat carcasses as makeshift punching bags, reaches the pinnacle of his career with victory over the quick, brash and charismatic Apollo Creed. After a number of defenses which his manager eventually admits were handpicked and posed no threat to Rocky, he then decides to defend his title against hard-hitting slugger Clubber Lang, and is knocked out in two rounds. Afterward, Apollo Creed, (the analogue for Muhammad Ali) trains Rocky to fight in a different way, mirroring Apollo's own style. Rocky begins his rematch with Clubber doing very well by boxing and using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a>, but when Lang finds a way to start getting to him, Rocky makes a mid-fight switch, starts using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> defense to defend against the worst of Lang's punches while taunting Lang for his inability to knock Rocky out. Lang exhausts himself trying to KO Rocky, and Rocky knocks him out.
</li><li> <strong>Real life:</strong> Mike Tyson, a young delinquent from a broken home, shows boxing talent and is taken in by legendary trainer Cus D'Amato, who eventually goes so far to adopt Tyson. Tyson begins cutting a swath through professional boxing, gaining notice because of how quickly and brutally he knocks out his competition, but D'Amato dies before Tyson captures the heavyweight title. After D'Amato's death, sleazy and unprincipled promoter Don King gets Tyson to break with the management team D'Amato left behind to look after Tyson by convincing Tyson that he'd make more money with King and that Tyson's management team was stealing from him. (They weren't, they were investing for his retirement.) This begins leading Tyson down a road to ruin.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV">Rocky V</a>:</strong> Tommy Gunn, a young delinquent from a broken home, seeks out legendary retired boxer Rocky Balboa, and eventually gets Rocky to be his trainer. Eventually, Tommy is taken in as a member of the family. Tommy soon gains media attention by cutting a swath through the heavyweight ranks with quick knockouts, but he also gains the attention of sleazy and unprincipled boxing promoter George Washington Duke. Tommy, frustrated that Rocky insists on progressing Tommy's career at a slow and steady pace rather than going for the title shot, is seduced away by Duke, who promises him a title shot and more money than Rocky could get him. This sets Tommy up to go down the wrong path.
</li><li> Just compare these speeches from Cus D'Amato, Mike Tyson's trainer, and adoptive father, (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QACELH3www&amp;t=2m45s">link<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and Rocky's flashback of Mickey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV">Rocky V</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em>, the idea for a match between long retired champion Rocky and current champion Mason Dixon comes about after a computer simulation shows a prime Rocky beating the undefeated champion. In the late 1960s, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> had been stripped of his title for refusing to fight in Vietnam, a computer simulation was done and showed long-retired champion Rocky Marciano defeating Ali who was unbeaten at the time. The two even stepped into the ring and did some sparring to provide footage for it.

</li><li> In 1989, Swedish writer Jan Guillou wrote <em>Enemy's Enemy</em>, where the main character's mission involves killing the spy Stig Sandström who had escaped from prison and fled to Moscow, which is what the real-life spy Stig Bergling had done two years earlier. The big difference is that the character also had killed his wife, while Bergling's wife had fled the country with him. After Bergling turned himself in to the authorities in 1994, he called Guillou from prison and said that he probably deserved a signed copy of the book, which Guillou agreed to, and sent him a book where he wrote that "this is the strangest dedication I've ever written."

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em>: The 1980 episode "In Concert," in the wake of a tragic incident at a December 1979 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> concert in (where else) Cincinnati, where 11 people were trampled to death in a stampede prior to the concert. The real-life events are set within the context of the show's fictional universe, with station personnel engaged in their usual banter and fun and games in promoting the concert in the first act, and then coming to grips with the events of the concert in the second act and vowing to call for action. The episode went on to earn critical acclaim from many who saw the episode, calling to attention a dangerous phenomenon that had fortunately never happened anywhere else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RippedFromTheHeadlines/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RippedFromTheHeadlines/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> is such a recurrent offender that it has its own page. However, the show has a better excuse than <em>Law &amp; Order</em>: Since the show's gimmick is profiling, the characters can only solve crimes by literally comparing them to previous, real cases they have studied in their career. Even when these real cases aren't explicitly mentioned, many a true crime aficionado will have little trouble spotting the similarities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty">Casualty</a></em>:
<ul><li> Occurred in July 2012, Casualty did a two part episode, featuring a riot in its fictional setting of Holby, this was similar to the riots in English cities a year ago.
</li><li> A storyline from the 1990s in which an ambulance ended up going off the road and laying across a railway line was very obviously based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Heck#Great_Heck_rail_crash">the Great Heck rail accident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The next-of-kin of those killed in the crash were less than impressed.
</li></ul></li><li> Sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HolbyCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HolbyCity">Holby City</a></em> has managed to time storylines so they appear onscreen at the same time a story is just becoming big news thanks to industry insiders - the producers received a heads up on a story about dodgy breast implants in France several months before it actually broke, and the story was only becoming a major scandal at the same time the resulting related plot appeared on screen. As well as this, there is a recent series of episodes involving John Gaskell and a "Miracle Cure" for someone to walk, which is based on the David Noakes Scandal.
</li><li> All of this makes watching True Crime shows like <em>American Justice</em> or <em>Cold Case Files</em> an interesting experience, especially when you recognize a case you didn't know had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> has done this a few times:
<ul><li> The very first episode, "Look Again" is based on the Martha Moxley case.
</li><li> "The Boy In The Box" is inspired by the actual Philadelphia unsolved case of the same name.
</li><li> "Thrill Kill" is based on the case of the Memphis Three.
</li><li> "Strange Fruit" is based on the murder of Emmett Till.
</li><li> George Marks (<em>Mind Hunters</em>, <em>The Woods</em>) hunted naked women in the woods, like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hansen">Robert Hansen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> "Wednesday Women" is based on the murder of Viola Liuzzo.
</li><li> "Flashover" is based on the polemic arrest and conviction of Cameron Todd Willingham.
</li><li> "Jurisprudence" is based on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a scandal about two judges who'd send kids with very minor offenses to private juvenile facilities for bribes, the "Kids for Cash" scandal</span>.
</li><li> "Lonely Hearts", based on serial killers Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez. The characters are even given the same names as their real life counterparts.
</li><li> The Sleepover", based on the murder of Shanda Sharer.
</li><li> Even when not based on specific cases, many other episodes reference the hot-button social issues of the day—the AIDS crisis of the early-80s ("It's Raining Men"), the stock market boom of the mid-80s ("Greed"), the dot.com boom of the late-90's ("Start Up"), etc. The oldest case revisited ("Torn") is the murder of an activist for women's suffrage in 1919.
</li><li> More examples listed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RippedFromTheHeadlines/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RippedFromTheHeadlines/ColdCase">Here</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine">Strong Medicine</a></em> had a storyline that referenced the 2005 Glendale train derailment (where a guy left a truck on the track). They made the suspect in the episode female...and bipolar.
</li><li> Just about every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> show (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs">NUMB3RS</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> ... remarkably none of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>s participating) got to show off their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyLocalChinatown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyLocalChinatown">Friendly Local Chinatown</a> for an episode based on the ancient Chinese custom of "ghost brides": the family of a young man who died before getting married arranges for a deceased girl to marry him in the afterlife; the episode typically dealt with someone who forgot the "deceased" part when selecting a bride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>: Female combat pilots in the Navy? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>? Issues with various aircraft? Homeless veterans? Racial bigotry? Gays in the service? You pick 'em, this show has 'em in spades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A. Law</a></em>:
<ul><li> It once had an episode based on the case of Angela Carder, a pregnant woman terminally ill with cancer forced to undergo premature cesarean section by court order. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, both died. On TV, the baby survived.
</li><li> This was common for whatever the 'light' sub-plot was for <em>L.A. Law</em>. Lawsuits and criminal charges based around toad-lickers and bull semen were often fictionalized news bites.
</li></ul></li><li> The first three seasons of the Canadian crime series <em>DaVinci's Inquest</em> dealt with the main characters attempting to find out who was behind the disappearances of prostitutes in and around the Vancouver area. The show was inspired by the real-life kidnappings of prostitutes by B.C. pig farmer Robert Pickton (he hadn't been caught at the time the show began), and numerous episodes contained characters speaking at length on the failure of the Vancouver police department to find the killer. When Pickton was caught, the creators dropped the plotline altogether.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GroundedForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GroundedForLife">Grounded for Life</a></em> was promo-ed as "ripped from the headlines", when a character's interference causes the Yankees to lose a game. Except that the real game was between the Marlins and Cubs, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">the episode was a rerun</a>.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> takes the pregnancy pact reportedly taken by a group of Mass. girls and incorporates it into the storyline. Bones herself thought it was a good idea for the girls to band together; meanwhile, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the "pact" turned out to be a huge coincidence fanned by rumors and probably more than a little snarking.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> was based on the Bernie Madoff blowup and the pilot had a similar plotline to the Elliot Spitzer scandal. Secret Santa lampshades this by referring to the event that inspired the episode.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a> team also took down a Madoff expy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains">Hank-Med</a> was hired to treat another one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs">NUMB3RS</a></em> does this - many episodes (including the pilot) are based on real-life cases, but not recent ones. For instance, the Season Five finale had a cult figure based off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">played by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Gaius Baltar</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropDeadDiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropDeadDiva">Drop Dead Diva</a></em> did this all the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> did an episode based upon the case of Whitney Cerak and Laura VanRyn. Two young women similar in appearance and build were misidentified after sustaining horrific injuries in an accident. In the House episode, as in real life, one of the women did not survive and the other woman's care was supervised by the deceased woman's family.
</li><li> So did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>, with the twist (of course) being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "dead" girl's mother accidentally killed her own daughter, who she (and everyone else) thought was the party-girl "survivor"</span>. Later in the series, the episode "Misconceptions" was based on the disappearance of Etan Patz.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer">Ghost Whisperer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> did episodes based on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_Crematory">Tri-State Crematory scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where corpses were never cremated and "piled like cord wood" in the undergrowth. <em>Ghost Whisperer</em>s caretaker was just old and senile while <em>CI</em>s caretaker was both bad at business and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using the undergrowth to hide bodies for his assassin brother. Said brother was also trying to give him business advice, to no avail</span>.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> have plots based on a census taker who found in the woods, strung up with the word "FED" pinned to his shirt. While both stories will undoubtedly be murders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> revealed it was actually a staged suicide — he was attempting to pin his death on local rednecks so his family would get the insurance money.
<ul><li> <em>CSI: Miami</em> went for quadruple plot points by adding slave labor, a repossessed house, and a meth lab.
</li></ul></li><li> Original flavour <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a> Vegas</em>:
<ul><li> It did an episode revolving around guns produced in 3D printers within barely a month of news breaking about Defense Distributed's Liberator.
</li><li> "Anatomy of a Lye" ripped the case of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chante_Jawan_Mallard">Chante Jawan Mallard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who struck a homeless man with her car, drove home with him clinging to the roof, and left him to bleed out in her garage rather than taking him to a hospital.
</li><li> "Unfriendly Skies", a first season episode, ripped the murder of Las Vegas resident Jonathan Burton aboard a plane, which took place a mere two months before the airing of the episode.
</li><li> "Felonius Monk" was based on the massacre of several monks at a Buddhist temple in Arizona during a robbery in 1991.
</li><li> "Overload", based on the death of a child during a "rebirthing" session intended to bound her to her adopted mother, in 2000.
</li><li> "I like to watch", featuring a woman raped in her appartment by a man pretending to be a fireman, was ripped from an identical case that took place in New York the year before.
</li><li> The Season 2 premiere "Burked" was based heavily on the murder of Ted Binion, right down to the cause of death and the victim being the son of a casino magnate.
</li><li> "Leaping Lizards," involving the murder of a woman involved in a UFO group that believed in the existence of reptilian aliens, is loosely inspired by the murder of Girly Chew Hossencofft, whose con artist ex-husband convinced a UFO believer that she was a reptilian who needed to die.
</li></ul></li><li> And now there's a TV movie called <em>Pregnancy Pact</em>, "based on a true story" according to the ads. Just like with the example mentioned for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> above, the true story is that there was no pact and the story was nothing but rumor and bad journalism. It could still be called "true" if it was a movie all about half-assed sensationalist reporting, but so far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">that's not how the ads are making it look</a>.
</li><li> Happened accidentally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit">The Unit</a></em>, in an episode where the members of the unit infiltrate Syria to rescue Jonas' daughter, despite being strictly told not to do so because it constitutes as an act of war against a sovereign nation. Just two weeks before the episode was aired, there were actual news reports of an American attack in Syria, involving an infiltration team and helicopters. While the episode itself was (probably) written and filmed long before these events, the fact that it aired two weeks after it actually happened makes this a curious case of accidental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a>. (In point of fact, such a coincidence would usually lead to such an episode being pulled by the network and rescheduled for later, on account of it being too soon.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "The Late Shaft" pretty much based its entire story around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">Jay Leno</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> debacle over at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>, with a dash of David Letterman's affair/blackmail story thrown in for good measure. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion">Nathan Fillion</a> was a guest on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></em> that night...
</li><li> The episode "47 Seconds" also dealt with bombings at an expy of the Occupy movement. (When the repeat aired on TNT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">just after the Boston Marathon attack</a>, they issued an apology.)
</li><li> The episode "Habeas Corpse" features a car company that was fictional and totally <em>not</em> General Motors, that had decided it would be cheaper to cover up several deaths due to a fault in their car (the airbag, instead of the ignition switch) rather than issue a recall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em> often took sci fi twists on whatever was going on during The War on Terror
</li><li> Every season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages">Damages</a></em> features this:
<ul><li> Season 1 was based on Enron's pension scheme shenanigans.
</li><li> Season 2 was partly based on fracking pollution scandals and partly on Enron's manipulation of the energy market.
</li><li> Season 3 revolved around the family of a stockbroker who had been caught and convicted of running the largest Ponzi scheme in history but definitely wasn't Bernie Madoff, honest.
</li><li> Season 4 dealt with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX">Brand X</a> of Blackwater and secret CIA torture in Afghanistan.
</li><li> Finally, Season 5 was based on WikiLeaks and the sex crime accusations against Julian Assange.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiTheNextGeneration">Degrassi: The Next Generation</a></em>
<ul><li> Season 3, In one of the series' many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop">Gay Aesop</a> stories, Marco's shoes get stolen when he's the victim of a hate crime, much like Matt Sheppard, only not as lethal.
</li><li> Season 13, In a plot that seems to be blatantly following this trope, basketball player Miles and his best friend are shown taking photos of and carrying Zoë (who is inebriated and unconscious) into the pool house where she is later recorded being raped by unknown assailants, resembling the Steubenville rape case. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The rapists turn out to be members of the hockey team, again similar to the Steubenville case (in which they were football players).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played with a little in <em>Blue Heelers</em>, where a character might mention police quotas and revenue-raising. Can lead into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>.
</li><li> Many of the scenarios featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo">What Would You Do?</a></em> reflect real world incidents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em> was based on actual events and was made with as much realism as possible.
</li><li> A variation occurred on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. In the middle of a space battle between the Defiant and some Klingon warships, a civilian transport decloaked and was promptly blown away by Worf, thinking it was an attacker. The episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS04E18RulesOfEngagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS04E18RulesOfEngagement">Rules of Engagement</a>", focused on Worf being on trial over the incident. A similar incident, involving a US AEGIS cruiser and an Iranian civilian airliner flying through the middle of a battle and getting shot down took place, and the captain ended up on trial for it... back in 1988, almost a decade before this episode aired. Incidentally, the writers of that episode went on to write for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> often has this, with episodes based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Big_Branch_Mine_disaster">the Upper Big Branch mine disaster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/147467/pfizer%3A_the_drug_giant_that_makes_bank_from_drugs_that_can_kill_you/">Pfizer's rather bad week of quality control,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> among others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">John Rogers</a> often says on his blog that most of his stuff is just as pulled from the headlines as the other crime dramas, only with less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">sodomy with a violin bow</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> One of the criticisms of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonPublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonPublic">Boston Public</a></em> was how <em>every</em> school-related controversy during the late 90's/early 2000's seemed to happen at that one high school.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABCFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABCFamily">ABC Family</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Cyberbully</em> is based on the many stories of people committing suicide after they are bullied online.
</li><li> Stephen King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingdomHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingdomHospital">Kingdom Hospital</a></em> not only incorporated King's own roadside near-demise, but also did an episode based on the series-losing error by, and subsequent pariah status of, Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner.
</li><li> The CBS show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable">Unforgettable</a></em>, about a detective that can remember everything that ever happened to her, has this in the episode "Check Out Time". The episode was about a Dominican hotel maid who was accused of murdering someone, but claimed he was attempting to rape her. The plot revolves around the detectives solving the questionable story. The story was pretty obviously based on the recent case involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn's alleged rape of an African hotel maid with a questionable story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crownies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crownies">Crownies</a></em> has a few examples, with one case being based quite clearly on the murder of Carl Williams.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> episode "My Lunch" was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/magazine/10ORGANS.html">ripped from a real case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

As the episode's title suggests, the moral is that sometimes bad things just happen with no one to blame. However the case of George Russell Weller, on which the episode was based, was not so co cut and dried. There was evidence that the incident was a premeditated spree-killing.

</li><li> Another episode, aired not even one year after Josef Fritzl was arrested, had Sam and Dean come across the incestuous descendants of a man that imprisoned his daughter in the cellar and raped her. Dean even comments that "this sounds like something out of the Austrian newspapers".
</li></ul></li><li> The second half of the first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Babylon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Babylon">Babylon</a></em> was based on the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan and the resulting riots.

The missing crew likewise refers to the missing crew of the <em>Lady Be Good</em>, who were later discovered to have perished trekking across the desert under the mistaken belief they were near the Mediterranean Sea, instead of over 400 miles inland. Finally, the date on Sgt. William F. Kline's grave is April 5, 1943, the day after that the <em>Lady Be Good</em> vanished.

While the events don't allude to a specific real case, hate groups such as Neo-Nazis are known to recruit from troubled youths on the Internet, giving them a deep sense of community, belonging and purpose, and then weaponizing the loyalty thus gained into hate and violence. One of the most obvious allusions is that "red pill", the way the group in the show calls themselves, is also an expression used by these sort of groups to refer to "enlightenment" to the truth and rejection of the "indoctrination" to ideas like "women, LGBT and people of color also deserve to have equal rights."

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had two in the same album: Paul wrote "She's Leaving Home" after reading about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderlustSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderlustSong">a girl who hit the road</a>, and John wrote "A Day in the Life" based on two news articles (the car accident and the holes found in a road; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> in another stanza is probably <em>How I Won The War</em>, in which he worked).
</li><li> This was common during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> movement of the early 1960s. Singers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilOchs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilOchs">Phil Ochs</a> would write songs, often using old folk melodies, about current events. Three of the best examples of this are Dylan's "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonesome_Death_of_Hattie_Carroll">Lonesome Death of Hattie Caroll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>," about the real-life killing of a poor black maid by a <a class="urllink" href="http://threepanelsoul.com/view.php?date=2006-11-15">bored aristocrat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. "Hurricane", about black boxer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_Carter">Hurricane Carter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned instead of the two whites who started a shooting at a bar (he was later exonerated and set free). And "Who Killed Davy Moore" about the boxer who died in the ring. Phil Ochs' "Outside A Small Circle of Friends" commemorates the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese">Kitty Genovese murder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where a supposed 38 witnesses did nothing <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/resurrecting-kitty-genovese-love-story/">(not entirely true)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because they "didn't want to get involved." Ochs (who studied journalism) called himself a "singing journalist" and titled his first album "All the News That's Fit to Sing".
</li><li> Dylan and Ochs both followed the footsteps of Woody Guthrie, who wrote songs like this; "Pretty Boy Floyd" and "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" are probably the most famous.
</li><li> His son Arlo Guthrie belongs here as well, the littering incident from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant">Alice's Restaurant</a>" made the local newspaper before he wrote the song.
</li><li> At least a couple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> songs were inspired by current events. The immensely-acclaimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown">"Time Will Crawl"</a> was inspired by Bowie's hearing of the Chernobyl Disaster on the radio in Switzerland, while the title track of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackTieWhiteNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackTieWhiteNoise">Black Tie White Noise</a></em> came from Bowie being a firsthand witness to the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles. A somewhat milder (yet also more extreme) example of this trope can be seen with the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heathen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heathen">Heathen</a></em>, on which are several tracks that were rather heavily influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">the September 11 Attacks</a>.
</li><li> The idea for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a>' song "Plush" is, according to singer Scott Weiland, partially taken from an article he read in the paper one day about a woman's murder.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s "Polly" was based on the kidnapping and brutal rape of a girl who eventually escaped from her attacker. Cobain later found out that two boys ended up singing the song while raping a different girl, inspiring the song "Rape Me", making this a rare case where one "ripped from the headlines" work ended up leading to the creation of another.
</li><li> "18 and Life" by Skid Row was written when guitarist Dave Sabo read a newspaper article about the event.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Superchick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Superchick">Superchic[k]</a>'s "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8nBBvjZ-M">Hero<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" seems in response to claims of bullying in schools and/or teen suicides.
</li><li> The album <em>"The Crusade"</em> by heavy metal band Trivium had four examples of this; "Entrance of the Conflagration" (about the murder of four children by their mother Andrea Yates), "Unrepentant" (about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his four daughters), "Contempt Breeds Contamination" (about the racially-influenced killing of a Guinean immigrant by four cops in New York), and "And Sadness Will Sear" (about the hate-driven torture and murder of Matthew Shepard).
</li><li> The murder of Matthew Shepard also inspired Melissa Etheridge's song "Scarecrow."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode">Depeche Mode</a> did a song in 1986 called "New Dress", where nearly every line was taken from an actual headline.
<ul><li> "Blasphemous Rumours" is a song that's actually about the lead singer's <em>sister</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The song "Maria Navarro" by Was/Not Was. Maria Navarro called 911 because her estranged husband had threatened to kill her. Dispatchers ignored the call and Maria died.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists">The Decemberists</a>' "12/17/12" was written as a way for Colin Meloy to cope with the conflicting feelings between his happy personal life and the suffering of the victims of the then-recent Sandy Hook shooting.
</li><li> To an extent, the song about <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dooley_%28song%29">Tom Dooley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> "We Didn't Start the Fire" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> is made entirely of this, referencing headline events all the way from 1949, the year of Joel's birth, to 1989, the year of the song's release.
</li><li> The 1993 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">Duran Duran</a> album track "Sin of the City" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeddingAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeddingAlbum">The Wedding Album</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5n0hi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5n0hi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5n0hi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">actually titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Duran Duran</a></em>, but referred to as <em>The Wedding Album</em> to distinguish it from the group's 1981 debut album</span>) was basically a recount of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Land_fire">1990 fire at the Happy Land<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a nightclub in The Bronx, that killed 87 people (though the lyrics state, "89 dead").
</li><li> Another song inspired by the Happy Land fire was "Happy Land" by seminal New Wave/punk rock musician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeJackson">Joe Jackson</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GordonLightfoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GordonLightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a> wrote and recorded two noteworthy songs about true events; his hit single "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" was in fact about the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Fitzgerald">1975 sinking of the American Great Lakes freighter SS Edmund Fitzgerald<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and "Black Day in July", a 1968 song about the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Detroit_riot">1967 Detroit race riots<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Savatage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Savatage">Savatage</a> based a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWakeOfMagellan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWakeOfMagellan">The Wake of Magellan</a></em>, on such events. One being the murder of reporter Veronica Guerin by drug lords. The second being the Maersk Dubai incident, were the captain of a freighter ordered discovered stowaways to be thrown overboard.
</li><li> Brenda Ann Spencer's 1979 shooting rampage that killed two people and injured nine others was the inspiration for The Boomtown Rats' song ''I Don't Like Mondays." The title of the song was what she stated was her reason for doing it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s "American Skin (41 Shots)", from the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo by four New York City police officers.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LivingColour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LivingColour">Living Colour</a> also do live covers of this song.
</li><li> Springsteen's "Nebraska" is about the Charles Starkweather murder spree.
</li></ul></li><li> The verse in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>'s song "Nobody's Hero" from their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Counterparts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Counterparts">Counterparts</a></em> album starts "I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family, all their lives were shattered in a nightmare of brutality" refers to the family of one of the girls murdered by Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo. The line "Hero - Lands a crippled airplane..." refers to the pilot who landed the United Flight 232 in Sioux City, Iowa using only the engines to control it after the flight controls failed, saving 185 of the 296 people on board.
<ul><li> Also, the song "Heresy" from the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RollTheBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RollTheBones">Roll the Bones</a></em> was written about Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</li></ul></li><li> The song "The Way" by <em>Fastball</em> is based on a news story from 1997 about an elderly couple from Salado, Texas, who disappeared on their way to a local event being held in Temple, and were later found dead at the bottom of a 25 foot cliff just a few miles outside of Hot Springs, Arkansas (more than 500 hundred miles from their destination). Lead singer Tony Scalzo was inspired to write lyrics about a presumably middle-aged couple who just got fed up with their lives and reality, and abandoned their children and everything else for a chance to find paradise. The refrain still makes it clear that they've reached Heaven, but their ghosts can still be seen wandering.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">"The Modest Revolution"</a> by Enter The Haggis is based entirely on articles from a single issue of the Toronto Globe and Mail. The second track "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.enterthehaggis.com/newsflash#.URl5I4XmZFR">"Can't Trust The News"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is based on a woman who, after some horrible couple years climbed the highest peak on each continent. In her 60's.
<ul><li> A significant number of their other songs are based on true stories.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGazette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGazette">The Gazette</a>'s song "Taion" is allegedly based on the murder of Junko Furuta, a seventeen-year-old girl who was kidnapped and tortured for an entire month before her abusers killed her.
</li><li> "Bind Torture Kill" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation">Suffocation</a>, off their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a>, is loosely inspired by the serial killer Dennis Rader, who was arrested about a year before the album's release. The lyrics themselves are more about the mindset of a serial killer than any of Rader's specific murders, though.
</li><li> "Hey Man Nice Shot" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter">Filter</a> is about the politician Budd Dwyer, a Pennsylvania state treasurer who was accused of corruption. Vehemently claiming his innocence until the end, in early 1987 Dwyer called a press conference during which he read half of a prepared statement and then shot himself. The song was released in 1995 and its timing and subject matter lead many to speculate it was written about the similar suicide of Kurt Cobain but it was written in 1991.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a>'s single "Jeremy" from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenPearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenPearlJam">Ten</a></em> is about the suicide of Jeremy Wade Delle, a 15-year-old boy from Richardson, Texas. On January 8th, 1991, Delle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun">shot himself in the mouth with a revolver</a> in front of his teacher and his classmates, and so Eddie Vedder was moved to write the song both as an anti-bullying anthem and as an anti-suicide anthem, and is now one of their most well-known songs.
</li><li> The music video for "Learn To Fly" by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a></em> was inspired by an incident where the Drug Enforcement Agency discovered cocaine stashed away inside the nose cone of a commercial jet. The band took this idea and ran with it, featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBlack">Jack Black</a> and Kyle Gass of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenaciousD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenaciousD">Tenacious D</a></em> scrambling to hide away some cocaine before they're caught. They stash it inside the coffee maker, which results in everyone getting high as balls, including the flight crew. This leaves the band members themselves, who had already been served other drinks before-hand, to make an emergency landing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a> "New York Mining Disaster 1941". (To be picky, it was inspired by the Aberfan Mining Disaster 1966, according to the other Wiki.)
</li><li> "Five Miles Out" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield">Mike Oldfield</a> is autobiographical - the unexperienced pilot of his machine directly flew into a storm, and they all survived only with a lot of luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrosbyStillsNashAndYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrosbyStillsNashAndYoung">Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young</a></em> had "Ohio", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> penned by Neil Young about the 1970 Kent State shootings.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a> song "Sex Dwarf" was inspired by a headline which Marc Almond read in the (now defunct) British tabloid <em>The News of the World</em>. Ironically, the duo found themselves on the wrong end of tabloid headlines after the song's video was reported to the police because of its sexually explicit content.
</li><li> "Miracle Man" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> is based on Jim Swaggart, a televangelist with whom Osbourne had butted heads who was caught in a prostitution scandal in 1988. Seems Osbourne couldn't resist the urge to call out "Jimmy Sinner" on his hypocrisy.
</li><li> Being a punk band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst">Rise Against</a> has a number of songs like this. "Make It Stop (September's Children)" was based on a number of prominent suicides of gay youths that were rooted in a history of harassment and bullying; the song even recites their names.
