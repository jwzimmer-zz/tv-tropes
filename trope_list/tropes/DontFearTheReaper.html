Therefore, when personifying it, the result was often pretty terrifying. However, there has also been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">very different attitude at times</a>, with various writers and artists creating a personification of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a> who is not only not scary, but friendly, compassionate, and otherwise the sort of person you'd want to find waiting for you at a difficult time like that.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any deceased human with enough spiritual energy can become a shinigami. The fact that the main character becomes one while still alive is a plot point before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> shows his face. Thus, the shinigami are just like humans: they can be friendly, moody, supportive, scary, hostile depending on situation or individual personality type. However, shinigami aren't enemies of humanity even if their focus on the big picture can make them seem aloof at times. Their role is to guide the dead to Soul Society, cleanse hollows of post-death sin so they too can be guided to Soul Society and also to maintain the balance of souls across different worlds. In other words, shinigami are portrayed the same way humans are portrayed: as individuals with their own personalities, worries, fears, foibles, strengths and weaknesses.
</li><li> This is arguably the overarching theme of the series. Death is indeed a scary thing, but it will happen to all of us eventually, so we might as well accept it. The final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Yhwach</a>, is written to be the embodiment of the fear of death, and is a perfect demonstration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">how far a person is willing to go to escape death</a>. A world of immortality does sound like a good idea on paper, but when one stops and really think about it, a world of immortality would have no need to grow and advance. In the end, death is necessary for progression.
</li></ul></li><li> The idea is alluded to in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">Laughing Bull</a> says "Do not fear death. Death is always by our side. When we show fear it jumps at us faster than light, but if we do not show fear, it casts its eye upon us gently, and guides us into infinity."
</li><li> Momo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BalladOfAShinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BalladOfAShinigami">Ballad of a Shinigami</a></em> is a sweet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalWhiteHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalWhiteHair">white-haired</a> girl who not only makes your death painless, she helps the people you are leaving behind by comforting them.
</li><li> Death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">Gregory Horror Show</a></em> is the only character shown to be completely friendly to the trapped guests, speaking kindly and offering to help where he can.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a>.</em> Shinigami have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> and most don't give humans and their lives very much thought. At the same time, they're not all bad — Ryuk really seems to enjoy hanging out with Light and often spends time doing goofy stuff like playing video games in his room. Two Shinigami fell in love with a human and used their powers to extend her life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In spite of their pleasant nature, Shinigami will never be "good" as it's understood by humans. Gelus and later Rem saved Misa's life but were both killed because Shinigami can never use their powers to prolong the lifespan of mortals, and after knowing and hanging out with Light for so many years, Ryuk was all too happy to kill him as soon as he stopped being entertaining.</span>
</li><li> The Arbiters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade">Death Parade</a></em> meet recently deceased humans to determine whether their souls should go back into the cycle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath">into the Void</a>, but are usually rather pleasant individuals to deal with, albeit with occasional hints of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">how utterly alien their minds are</a> compared to humans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu">Kamichu!</a></em>, Death is a rather friendly, if somewhat eccentric goddess, who even once had an affair with Poverty.
</li><li> In the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madoka herself</span> is seen appearing before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">magical girls whose soul gems are about to be corrupted and taking the gems with her</span>, enabling them to die peacefully and go to the afterlife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">without becoming witches</span>.
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>. Sailor Saturn is an entity of death and carries a scythe as a weapon. She has the power to destroy a planet if she wants. However she is not evil and her purpose is to kill off the remnants of a destroyed world, so that Sailor Moon can use her own powers to restore it. Any time she uses her death powers is only to allow rebirth to happen immediately afterwards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway">Spirited Away</a></em>, Chihiro takes a train to get to Zeniba's home which is intended for use by the dead moving onto the next life; it has phantom passengers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lord Death willingly embraces this trope. Back in his day he used to look like a textbook skull-and-black-cloak (read: very intimidating) Grim Reaper, but when he founded Death Weapon Meister Academy, he took on a <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/souleater/images/d/d5/Shinigami-sama%27s_Appearance_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130327234129">more friendly appearance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and goofy speech patterns, so as to not frighten his students. He saves that for his enemies.
</li><li> His son Death the Kid is also hardly a threatening image of death, being a teenage boy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a>. Don't try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">do whatever you like with human lives</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">He doesn't like that one bit.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the short manga story "Thirty and A Half Minutes" by Snippy MJ, the Reaper arrives at a hospital to collect a woman dying in childbirth. Just as her time is about to run out, the Reaper grants her an additional 30 minutes and 30 seconds, allowing her to deliver the baby and hold it in her arms, getting to share one moment with her husband and child as a family before she passes. It can be read <a class="urllink" href="http://smacmag.net/v/sma4/thirty-and-a-half-minutes-by-snippy-mj/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/a0pYd8L_700b_v2.jpg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> deals with the spirit of the pharaoh Abidos, challenging Judai. After losing, he passes on, satisfied that he finally found an opponent who would duel him seriously. Judai refuses his offer to go with him to the afterlife, but promises to meet him again after 100 years. The episode ends with the crew discussing death and the afterlife. Needless to say, this didn't go well with the translators.

<ul><li> The French comic <em>Le Collège Invisible</em> has an incarnation of Death quite similar to Gaiman's Perky Goth, and possibly inspired by her.
</li><li> Although Cernunnos, the Elder God of Death from Joseph Michael Linsner's <em>Dawn</em> series can definitely take terrifying form if he so chooses (if, for example, he needs to curb-stomp a group of angels and demons who've decided to trespass on Earth with their bickering), the one time we see him welcoming a soul to the afterlife, he takes a much more attractive form and greets her...very warmly.
</li><li> Bernie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathVigil">Death Vigil</a></em> doesn't claim souls at all—instead, she focuses on protecting people from death by combating primordial forces of evil that want to eat reality. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">revives</a> people who have died to join the Vigil and gives them veilrippers to fight against said primordial evils. In her spare time, she likes listening to modern music on her iPod and dancing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>: The Martians worshipped H'ronmeer, the god of death and fire (though some regard him as a god of life and light), who called all Green Martians his children. He was blamed for the plague that wiped out the Martian race, but that was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Ma'alefa'ak</a>'s fault. On one occasion, he seemed to be coming after J'onn, but in truth he just needed his help to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">lead the Martians' souls to the afterlife</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>'s Death can be like this. Sometimes, she seems like a nice girl, if a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">dead inside</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, she could also be quite evil.
<ul><li> Wade Wilson, prior to becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, even fell in love with her, and one of the reasons he can't die is because one of her jealous suitors made him immortal so he'd stay away from her, which is another reason why Deadpool is so freaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>. Amazingly, she's been shown to reciprocate his feelings—but they can only meet during the few seconds after he dies and before his mutant power/immortal curse can call him back to life. Death as a star-crossed lover?
</li><li> Death has also appeared as a low-key but friendly construction worker, to Jean Grey and Rachel Grey-Summers.
</li><li> In another X-Men related example, New Mutant Dani Moonstar once tried to fight off an incarnation of Death from taking one of her (non-mutant) friends. She eventually allowed Death to do her job, after she explained why her 'gift' was not to be feared by those who were suffering.
</li><li> She <em>can</em> stop being nice if she wants to. When she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DraculaLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DraculaLives">appeared to Dracula</a> - who she clearly didn't like - she took a male form that was far more intimidating.
</li><li> In any story involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> (which constitutes <em>most</em> of the stories she appears prominently in), she is presented as a cruel, greedy, and insidiously manipulative being who enjoys causing suffering almost as much as causing death itself; and is generally depicted as the very antithesis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">DC's compassionate version of Death</a>. At best, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a>, often crossing over into genuine evil (she actively seduced Thanos into becoming the living murder machine he is, while still always keeping him lonely and miserable). The reason her relationship with Deadpool is so funny is <em>because</em> it's so unusual for her to react with sincere affection (let alone love) to <em>anyone.</em>
</li><li> One story included a presumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards the DC Death, having Marvel Death appear as a cute goth girl who was far from perky:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Thanos:</strong> Must you wear that skin? <br/><strong>Death:</strong> Ah... you find it discomforting to hear this form speak of dark desire? Do I make you uncomfortable? <br/><strong>Thanos:</strong> Very. <br/><strong>Death:</strong> Lesson learned, Thanos of Titan. I am Death. I am not of comfort.
</div></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a> of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworld</a> gained the Infinity Gauntlet and went crazy with its power he attempted to invoke this by making death appear as a beautiful woman instead of a cloaked skeleton.
</li></ul></li><li> The Brazilian comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang">Monica's Gang</a></em> has one in the spinoff <em>Penadinho</em> (known in English as <em>Bug-a-booo</em>). Dona Morte/Lady McDeath is a clumsy Grim Reaper who is always forced to run after her "next clients". Her creator <a class="urllink" href="http://www.monica.com.br/mauricio/cronicas/cron285.htm">states<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (link's in Portuguese) that the character is an attempt of making death less scary than most people treat it, and tries to portray her as just someone doing her job, never an assassin.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, the interpretation of Death as an attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Perky Goth</a> is, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> version, probably the foremost modern example of the trope. This Death is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>, who appears at the end of every existence - humans, gods, stars - and offers a sympathetic face to remove some of the shock and terror of the moment. She isn't even bothered by the constant deaths and resurrections of the superhero set, cheerfully telling a baffled and enraged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> that, "they all seem like they're having so much fun!" And as she then points out, they'll all come with her eventually. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">didn't always have this positive mindset:</a> she developed this sympathy after a mysterious decision to spend one day a century in a mortal existence.

He typically greets those he's come to claim with a huge 'Welcome to Your Eternal Reward Party' intended to be as happy as possible for them with all their deceased loved ones as guests. He often even begins his role before they die by allowing them to relive their happiest moments.

Before that the German poet and journalist Matthias Claudius (1740-1815) often portrayed Death as a friendly personification, <em>Freund Hain</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13r1t');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13r1t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13r1t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> As the frontispice to Claudius' collected works shows and the illustration he commissioned for <em>Nach der Krankheit</em> show, Freund Hain is a classic skeleton with a scythe, but no cloak.</span> - a variation of <em>Freund Hein</em> or <em>Gevatter Hein</em> ("friend" or "godfather Hank", a common German euphemism for Death) - most famously in his poem <em>Der Tod und das Mädchen</em> ("Death and the Maiden", 1775), which also appears in the Music section. Another poem, <em>Nach der Krankheit</em> ("After Sickness", 1777) describes how during a bad fever Death comes to Asmus (Claudius' alter ego) and with a friendly smile offers to take him into his arm. Asmus asks him to pass him by this time, to which Freund Hain acquiesces, and the poem ends with Asmus saying: "And when you return sooner or later, please smile again, Hain!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookThief">The Book Thief</a></em> is narrated by Death, who is amusing, non-linear and <em>very</em> compassionate towards humans (he specifically states he's haunted by them, especially "the ones who are left behind"), particularly the other main characters. Given that it's a book about World War II, the "amusing" part takes a sharp turn. The death camp scenes, unsurprisingly, are particularly bad.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cerberon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cerberon">Cerberon</a></em>, Edu, the goddess of death, is described as loving and merciful in her duty to provide rest and comfort after death. She's in charge of keeping the dead from bothering the living, but doesn't seem very proactive in this regard, considering all the zombies, ghouls, vampires and ghosts hanging around, although she does promptly respond to her priests' calls to take them away.
</li><li> Considering that the main characters are almost all Grim Reapers and are by and large extremely likable people, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Croak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Croak">Croak</a></em> has this in spades.
</li><li> The Danish children's book <em>Cry, Heart, But Never Break</em> is about four young siblings who are trying to prevent Death from taking their gravely ill grandmother, who is sleeping upstairs. Death is drawn as a kindly, long-nosed old man in a hooded black robe. He's definitely a supernatural being, but his actions and attitude are deeply human, politely staying for coffee at the children's behest and telling them an allegorical story to explain the nature of his job and ease their fears.
</li><li> TG From <em>The Dead Detective</em> series is a totally happin' dude.
</li><li> While Death from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series is still probably not the kind of person (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a>) you'd like to meet in a dark alleyway, what with him still being the classic cowled skeleton and all, he's the closest thing the Discworld has to a responsible, benevolent deity, fulfilling a necessary role (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em> for what happens when he doesn't do the job). The other gods tend to be self-interested jerks running on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek Mythology</a> rules. It's worth noting that said role doesn't involve doing the <em>actual killing</em>, or even collecting the departed's life, but rather just facilitating the 'moving on' once the body is dead, and has no stake in the process. Not to mention that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover">very fond of cats</a> (it's suggested that cruelty to cats is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">one of the very few things that can make Death genuinely angry</a>, and he also has adopted rather a large number of his own, which by all indications he takes quite good care of). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, no matter how kind he is, people are still rarely pleased to see him (except under certain <em>very</em> unfortunate circumstances). Interestingly, despite him being a skeleton along the traditional Grim Reaper mould, there have been a fair few elderly or terminally ill fans (some imminently due to be "collected") who wrote to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> saying that they hope that he wasn't too far off the mark. Pratchett wrote that these letters usually caused him to spend some time staring at the wall. Especially when said fans were children.
<ul><li> Arguably codifying the trope, Death's former apprentice Mort and his wife, Ysabell (Death's adopted daughter), use "Non Timetis Messor" — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">slightly dodgy</a> Latin "Don't fear the Reaper" as their family motto.
</li><li> As a central protagonist in several books, a great deal Death's of characterisation is dedicated to <em>his</em> problems. Fiction rarely depicts the reaper after the soul of their client has moved on, but the Discworld does, and it illustrates what it would be like to have to have such a role; not just from his point of view, but from Mort's (when he was Death's apprentice), and his granddaughter Susan's (who thanks to the strange nature of Discworld inheritance, has picked up a number of his traits and abilities, to her great displeasure). It's noted that it's rarely a pleasant duty and he isn't allowed to interfere, so the same empathy that makes him sympathetic to others also brings him sadness and grief (probably the only mortal emotions he truly grasps), with his entire plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic">Soul Music</a></em> more or less summarising the five stages of grief from the point of view of a being who not only never forgets anything, no matter how hard he tries, but remembers it as if it was yesterday.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em> is devoted to Death discovering how vital kindness in his job is, and near the end, he delivers perhaps the defining quote for his character, and one of the defining ones for this trope.
<div class="indent"><span class="asscaps">Lord, what can the harvest hope for, if not for the care of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Reaper Man?</a></span>
</div></li><li> A major part of the plot in the later half of the book is the risk of this trope being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a>. Death is only to be feared if you've made him your enemy. The new emerging Death <em>of Humans</em> is exactly the sort of Death that <em>should</em> be feared.
</li><li> Interestingly, Death was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">much more petty and fearsome in his first appearances</a>, doing things like taking the life of a swarm of flies or a random passer-by out of anger for not being able to collect Rincewind's life. This was quickly dropped after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">a few books</a>.
</li><li> One of his most telling moments in the whole series is when he has to kill a chicken in <em>Reaper Man</em>... and is <em>utterly horrified</em>. His internal monologue explains that he never "takes" life - he simply takes over where life leaves off. When he does take a life, then has to spend the rest of the day laying down rat poison, the narration notes that he feels like a murderer.

The crowning moment comes when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> refills <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMatchGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMatchGirl">The Little Match Girl</a>'s hourglass rather than collect her soul</span>.

</div></li><li> A part of being a witch on the Disc is that witches know when they are going to die. Witches, being generally pragmatic, stoic types whose outward reaction to a cottage on fire would likely be the same as to spilling their tea, tend to treat this not as a terrifying prospect, but as a well-appreciated chance to get their affairs in order and pass the homestead on to the next witch, before meeting Death with a sense of familiarity. Wizards also know — they tend to treat it as a chance to have one last rousing feast and spend (and borrow) lots of money they won't be needing soon.
</li><li> Death has also been replaced temporarily by his apprentice Mort and Mort's daughter (Death's "granddaughter") Susan Sto Helit. One is a knobby-kneed adolescent male who gradually starts taking on Death's traits while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTakesAHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTakesAHoliday">Death Takes a Holiday</a>, and the other is a young woman, who inherited a number of said traits. Death and Susan are also two of the only things standing between humanity and the Auditors. <em>Boy</em> have they done a good job there...
</li><li> Death's struggle in <em>Thief of Time</em> is his inability to prevent the Auditors from freezing time, thus bringing about a kind of apocalypse, without breaking the rules. He gets around this by drafting Susan to do the legwork instead, but also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the Auditors remind him and the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a> that the rules state they have to ride out, Death is the one to point out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">the rules never specify</a> who they must ride out <em>against</em></span>.

</li><li> The final posts to Sir Terry Pratchett's Twitter account are as follows:
<div class="indent"><em><span class="asscaps">At last, Sir Terry, we must walk together.</span></em> <br/><em>Terry took Deaths arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night.</em> <br/><em>The End.</em>
</div></li><li> Interestingly, the surgical team who treated Terry Pratchett for a minor procedure - which after patient questioning on his part, turned out to have become somewhat more complicated and turned into a more urgent Situation - told him afterwards that he'd sat up during the operation, demonstrating the anaesthesia wasn't <em>quite</em> working, and had a one-sided conversation with an unseen Other in the operating theatre. Pratchett had apparently asked that if he had to go at this point, could a packed lunch be provided? Ham sandwiches with mustard would be appreciated. Apparently he was only offered plain ham with no condiments, and had expressed disappointment. Terry was both perplexed and oddly reassure by this, and this account of his own NDE - which he didn't remember at all save through the doctor's recollection - ended up in a Discworld novel as a discourse between an elderly witch and Death. This is recollected in <em>A Blink Of The Screen</em>, a collection of his non-fiction writings. Hopefully Death remembered the mustard, when the time did arrive.

<ul><li> The Japanese live-action drama <em>Shinigami-kun</em> based on the manga of the same name is portrayed as someone who can pass for human, albeit a human with a rather odd taste in clothes. He frequently shows up to congratulate the soon-to-be-dearly-departed on their impending demise, and tell them that they have three days left to live and to tie up and loose ends. He's also baffled and often rather hurt that - with one exception - none of the people he mentions this to are all that happy about the heads up.

A woman frightened of dying allows a wounded police officer (played by a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRedford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRedford">Robert Redford</a>) into her apartment.

<div class="indent"><em>Mother, give me your hand... You see. No shock. No engulfment. No tearing asunder. What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper. What you thought was the end is the beginning.</em> — Death, assuring the old woman that her journey has just begun. <br/>...
</div><div class="indent"><em>Am I really that frightening? Before you knew who I was, you sat with me. Talked with me.</em>
</div></li><li> With one or two exceptions, Death is regularly portrayed as a very polite man — often a businessman wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">nice suit</a>. Which, when you think about it, is probably a good thing since his job is to "welcome" people into death, not to make them run away from it.
</li><li> One character, Mr. Bookman, gets to make a deal to extend his life to finish his life's ambition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZone1959S1E2OneForTheAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZone1959S1E2OneForTheAngels">to make "a pitch for the angels"</a>. Death agrees but is annoyed when Bookman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">decides to retire</a> and says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancingDeathsBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancingDeathsBooks">he'll take a life of a little girl instead</a>, flinging Bookman's loophole back in his face when he tries to break the deal himself. This leads Bookman to make a pitch to Death a collection of worthless trinkets (ties, threads and matches) in order to make Death miss his appointment with the girl, thus completing his life's ambition of a big sale that made a difference. Either Death set the whole thing up just to make his client feel better or you can trick him by selling him cheap shoe polish; either way no need to fear him.

He regards a woman who has become fascinated with him with curiosity, but never animosity; eventually, he allows her to become his partner and she embodies the trope more closely by helping to comfort the dying as they are taken.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone2002">The Twilight Zone (2002)</a></em> revival, the episode "A Night In Mercy", Death is a kind man who doesn't like his job at all and admires a doctor for having the power to give life. Death decides to give up his job, and the doctor quickly finds out how vital it is when incurable burn patients are unable to die and are thus left in agony. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the doctor dies at the end of the episode, Death admits that he's tempted to let him go back to life, but both of them agree that it's just the way things go.</span>

<ul><li> Tessa, one of the Reapers. Admittedly, some of the other Reapers we see range from creepy to outright scary, but Tessa appears to spirits as a gorgeous, compassionate, and genuinely sweet servant of Death, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Sam and Dean even willingly save her from meeting a grisly fate in season four</span>. Though during her role there, she's a bit more snippy than in her first appearance, mostly dismissing the brothers when they try to help a dead young boy who has yet to pass on. The reason being, for the latter, was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was supposed to take Dean, until he was brought back to life by Azazel, thanks to his dad making a deal</span>.
</li><li> Death himself, the boss of the Reapers, also appears. Death is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity">Cosmic Entity</a> who is as old as the universe and about the same age as God. He runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> and has seen the death of entire galaxies and will eventually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">reap God!</a></em> Hence, he is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">extremely pissed off</a></em> that he is bound to one tiny planet circling around a barely newborn sun in a young galaxy that usually wouldn't even be a blip on his radar, due to "a spoilt brat having a tantrum" (a.k.a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Lucifer</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu">Dean has a little problem swallowing his pizza after being told this.</a> Just a gentle reminder that, no matter how much of a threat Lucifer may seem, there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Always a Bigger Fish</a>. A <em>much</em> bigger fish. This Death is also given a very human trait, one he shares with Dean: he really likes cheap but tasty food such as pizza, bacon dogs, and fried pickles.
</li><li> In a later episode Dean wants Death's help <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to restore Sam's soul</span> and Death gives him a test where Dean has to do Death's duties for a day. Dean <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fails the test but attempts to fix his mistake as much as he can</span>. Death is impressed that Dean was able to understand the seriousness and importantance of Death's job and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gives Sam his soul back</span>.
</li><li> When the Winchesters deal with Death he's usually quite snarky and dispassionate because he feels they're wasting his time by asking him for favors. However, when he's reaping someone he appears quite polite and complimentary and finds it an honor to guide specific people to the afterlife.
</li></ul></li><li> Death is a recurring character in the older BBC series <em>Mulberry</em>, which is appropriate given that the titular character Mulberry is his own son, tasked with cheering up a dour old woman before Death comes to call on business. He spends a good deal of his appearances arguing with Mulberry about how his job isn't a bad thing and how he'd like it if Mulberry would stop asking for extensions on the time he's got.

Throughout the course of the episode, and in dealing with his own potential illness, it is revealed that she is actually the Angel of Comfort (the same one who visited him when his dad died.) The Angel of Death does not appear.

I am a friend, and come not to punish. Be of good cheer! I am not savage. You will sleep softly in my arms."
</li><li> <em>Death on Hennepin</em> by Boiled in Lead, takes a more stern tack but ultimately the Reaper in this song is also present to ease the deceased's passing, not harm her or frighten her.

According to bandmates, he secluded himself for nine days, refused to talk to anyone, and emerged a lot happier with a fully-formed song about how he had come to terms with his own mortality. Over <em>forty</em> years on, he is still with us and fronting the band.
</li><li> The first member of the Blue Öyster Cult to be offered a personal opportunity not to fear the Reaper was keyboards player Allen Lanier.

</li><li> "When the Saints Go Marching In," a Christian hymn, is best known today as a jazz tune by Louis Armstrong. It's popular as a funeral march in New Orleans, it treats death as joyous occasion for those who are going to heaven. The song itself, is about the Second Coming, the Resurrection of the Dead, and the New Creation. Death is only mentioned indirectly by referring to "those who have gone before."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rage">Rage</a>'s album <em>Speak of the Dead</em> features a Grim Reaper in several songs who is "Heaven-sent" as a mercy to free one from pain, and wishes not to be feared.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas">Kansas</a> song "Child of Innocence". While the lyrics focus on the inevitability of death and the pointlessness of trying to prevent it, they also paint the grim reaper as a comforting figure that need not be feared.
</li><li> Gabriel Faure said of his Requiem Mass... "It has been said that my Requiem does not express the fear of death and someone has called it a lullaby of death. But it is thus that I see death: as a happy deliverance, an aspiration towards happiness above, rather than as a painful experience." The final movement, In Paradisum, is an incredibly beautiful lullaby.
</li><li> <em>She Was So Beautiful</em> by Russian rock-band <em>Splean</em> narrates about a beautiful woman met by an author who happens to be the Death. After a short talk she leaves, saying "hope to see you soon" and telling narrator not to sorrow about her.
</li><li> Argentine band Sui Generis gave us <em>Cancion para mi muerte</em> (Song for my death). The tone is like a love ballad and the lyrics speak directly to Death in a friendly manner, without making apology to suicide. In the last verses, the singer tells Death to warn him when it decides to go take him, not because he is afraid, but because he wants to dress his best.

The angels will escort the faithful to Heaven, but they'll also dutifully cast the wicked into Hell.
</li><li> Some scholars take "Angel of Death" from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a> to be an allegory for Jesus. A large number of angels also bear the title. The Kabbalic figure Azriel (known as Ezra/Azra in Orthodox Chritianity and Azrael in Islam and Sikhim) is probably the most famous today, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Michael</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Gabriel</a> also qualify. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> is also credited as an "angel" of death, so it's Zig Zagged.

Though they believed that those who offended the gods would suffer in the afterlife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">their religion</a> featured lovely, kind deities who welcomed the dead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">The Underworld</a> with beer and food.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Valkyries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Valkyries">Valkyries</a>, female spirits, are reapers of the souls of dead warriors deemed worthy of being taken to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Valhalla</a>. People who died of sickness and death went taken to Hel and Helheim, a shady but peaceful place. Hel is monstrous in appearance but a neutral deity that is understood to be kind, from what is understood from the poems.
</li><li> The Breton psychopomp Ankou has shades of this in some of the (frequently contradictory) legends about them. Most of the stories portray them as a fairly terrifying aversion of this; a skeletal figure with a scythe who has too much enthusiasm for their job, but in others they're simply the spirit of the last person to died in a parish the previous year who got drafted into spending a year serving as that parish's psychopomp. While this means that they can be very variable in how they do their job (a old Breton saying when there was more deaths that year than usual translates as 'on my faith, this one is a nasty Ankou'), it also means that there's a pretty good chance of the deceased being picked up by someone that they know which kind of makes the whole thing rather less scary; you're not dealing with some sort of inhuman supernatural being, you're getting a lift to the afterlife from a neighbor or maybe even a relative.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, to a faithful, the Archangel of Death would be like an old friend one has been waiting for, for years who takes the soul gently and tenderly on a silken cloth and sends it on it's way. Apparently he's also very accommodating and is even willing to wait a few moments if one asks. Though to a faithless he apparently appears in such a terrifying, vicious form that even messiahs with extremely strong hearts would faint at seeing him.
</li><li> The Persephone situation aside (and even that depends on which version of the myth you read), Hades is one of the nicest gods in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">Consummate Professional</a> and dog lover, in contrast to the capricious collection of rapists and other sundry ne'er-do-wells that makes up the rest of the pantheon (the ancient Greeks considered their gods more models <em>of</em> human behavior rather than <em>for</em>). While he's responsible for punishing the wicked in Tartarus, he's also responsible for rewarding great heroes and paragons in the Elysian Fields.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> setting really likes this trope. Kelemvor is the poster boy for this trope and canonically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a>. He and his worshipers work to comfort the living and ensure that the dead rest in peace, and Kelemvorite rangers, clerics and paladins are among the most determined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">undead</a> hunters in the setting. The setting also includes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">halfling</a> death god Urogalan, also LN, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Mulhorandi</a> god Osiris who is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a></em>. Even Kelemvor's unnerving-to-mortals subordinate Jergal counts, as he is merely the archivist of death.
<ul><li> In 2nd edition, Kelemvor was Lawful Good. He was changed to neutral later on because of D&amp;D's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">tendency to equate death powers to evil</a>. In-universe, the rest of the pantheon got together to stop him from being too nice.
</li><li> Sehanine Moonbow, the elven goddess of (amongst other things) death, was of the "Neutral Good" alignment and had a bit of a 'death as part of the journey of existence, not the end' slant to her. She got retconned as merely an aspect of Selûne (who does not have death in her portfolio) in 4th edition, however.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Greyhawk</em> setting, Wee Jas is the Lawful Neutral goddess of Death and Magic. Her clerics teach that death is part of the natural order, and that she shepherds the souls of the deceased to their final destinations. She was originally a goddess of magic, but after a magical disaster killed millions, magic was equated with death, which altered the perception of her to a more morbid figure. She's also a rival to Nerull, the Grim Reaper figure of the setting, since she's seen as a relatively healthy form of death worship, and Nerull... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">really, really isn't.</a>
</li><li> Ezra, the Lawful Neutral patron goddess of the Anchorites of Ravenloft, has an innate connection to Death, as she is said to have voluntarily merged with the Mists (themselves associated with death) in order to stand between the Land's dark forces and its inhabitants. She doesn't <em>cause</em> death, but is believed to shield the souls of the deceased from evil forces upon their passing.
</li><li> At least one god of death (a converted version of Hades) is explicitly stated to only be evil because the alignment was required for levels in the Assassin class, but would otherwise be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a>. Which makes sense.
</li><li> In the short-lived 4th Edition the deity of death, the Raven Queen, was Unaligned, and hated the undead. Which, since paladins in that edition only needed to match the alignment of their patron deity, made her rather popular with players.
</li></ul></li><li> The God of Death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to D&amp;D 3rd edition, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> Pharasma. She's is also the god of Fate, Prophecy, and Rebirth. She has no problem with Resurrection as you'll arrive in her domain eventually so there is no need to rush things.

<ul><li> Icthlarin of the Menaphite pantheon also qualifies, being the equivalent of Anubis or Osiris and hence the god of guiding souls into the afterlife. He and Death are good friends, to the point that Sliske holds Death hostage during the quest "Missing, Presumed Death" to guarantee Icthlarin's cooperation. Sadly, Icthlarin's sister Amascut (a splice of Ammut and Sehkmet), formerly the goddess of rebirth for the just and punishment for the unjust, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">gone round the bend</a>.

He says that it's mostly because he's really overworked, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most likely still processing people from the apocalypse a few centuries ago</span>. If you decline, he actually complains that you don't want to come back to life, and if you refuse a second time he'll let you queue up for the afterlife, but makes it clear that he really doesn't want to do it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em> series portrays the Grim Reaper very kindly; he listens to pleas for dead sims to be revived, and he gives a chance for the Sims to win back their loved ones, and even if they failed at his little game, he might bring them back as zombies anyway. He also gives discounts on children's resurrections. He enjoys watching TV, and if he arrives at a party, he might party with the residents, even though he always spoils the mood with his arrival. Oh that silly Reaper.
<ul><li> If a sim dies of old age while in Platinum Aspiration in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em>, the Reaper shows up in a flower lei, accompanied by hula girl zombies, to send your sim on an eternal vacation to Tropical Paradise Heaven.
</li><li> One of the plot hooks in Strangetown is the product of an affair between the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> and the friendly guy who kept coming for her husbands.
</li><li> Thanks to the University expansion, you can even call the Reaper and bribe him to resurrect your loved ones (or bargain with him as they're dying). He offers a reduced rate for children, but stiffing him otherwise can have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">some unpleasant consequences.</a>
</li><li> If you have the Pets expansion, the Reaper will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">play with your dogs and cats</a> when he comes for them.
</li><li> Though he does have his temper. In <em>Sims 3 University Life</em>, if you rant against him, he will strike down your sim. He does resurrect them and tells them not to do that again as he's got a job to do.
</li><li> One amusing glitch can happen in Sims 3. One tumblr user reported that a sims' husband died a few minutes before the female sim started to give birth. This causes all NPCs on the lot to panic at that... Including Death. Another posted "What do I do? This is the opposite of my job!"
</li><li> The Sims 4 adds to this even more. If the Grim Reaper comes to your lot to reap a sim, he will stay, and be interacted with. Your sim can come up and try to be his friend, and it will work! There's even an in-game achievement for doing this.
