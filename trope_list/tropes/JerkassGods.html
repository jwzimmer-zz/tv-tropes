Also, having different people write and tell different stories and myths about gods means that the deities in question are <em>very </em> prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> by whoever is writing the story, because even back then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">people liked to project themselves</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">and their opinions onto characters</a>, even if the characters are gods. Because of that, mythological characterization and continuity regarding the gods and other mythical figures tends to fluctuate wildly from story to story. Some of these authors and storytellers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">also made some gods</a> grab the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">Jerkass Ball</a> from time to time, which eventually spread out among public opinion and turned some deities from being viewed as nice to being seen as evil due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">people remembering deities more for the bad things they did</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">rather than for their heroic actions</a> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Everybody Hates Hades</a> trope is a good example of that). What was considered okay and acceptable back then isnt always what is considered okay and acceptable today, because society and its values change over time. Gods and the stories surrounding gods often reflect the cultures and societies that worshipped them. Since civilizations of ancient times or societies of other nations have different values and codes of ethics than the ones we have, then a god who is considered a Jerkass God by one civilization and time period may be viewed as a heroic god instead by another civilization and time period.

</li><li> And then, there's Zeno, the most powerful god who reigns over the others. He looks and acts like a cute child, but his backstory involves him wiping <em>6</em> universes in a fit of anger. The Universe Survival Arc is centering on him throwing a multiversal tournament to determine which universe would keep on existing. The ones which would have lost? They'll be erased. He's willing to do so <em>even though he befriended a mortal from one of the contesting universes</em>. And to make matters worse, the only reason he gives for this planned genocide is that he thinks there are too many universes. Oh and it turns out that Zeno is actually going to erase <em>all</em> of the universes once the tournament is over with the only reason he didn't do so is because of Android 17's wish to restore all of the universes which convinces them that the mortals are worth living.

Orihime-sama, the goddess who chooses whether or not to grant such wishes, is just about to grant Ichigo's wish that her bedwetting would stop until she sees Shouta's wish to get to meet Ichigo again. Bitter over being unable to ever see her <em>own</em> love, Orihime-sama nearly rejects Shouta's wish out of hand until she has another idea. She decides to grant Shouta's wish but, in exchange, she <em>worsens</em> Ichigo's wetting problems by making her wet herself anytime she interacts with the opposite gender. Orihime-sama's stated goal: To make it so that even if Ichigo and Shouta <em>do</em> reunite, which they do in high school, she will forever elude him. After that, Orihime-sama sees little Morei's wish, "Allways wanna bee wit Shoota", and gets so angry she makes Morei wet herself on the spot, wishing Shouta's loathing on her. After causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure">Potty Failure</a> in one six year-old, cursing another with wetting problems so severe she needs diapers in the present day, and doing so only to guarantee future problems for a third, Orihime-sama decides to go home and play games, tired from actually working for once.

Most of the gods are decent enough to mortals, as they all used to be mortal themselves, but as disaster after epic disaster piles up, the pantheon's individual ways of coping become increasingly unhealthy and problematic, not to mention dangerous to the rest of the world and each other. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">Woden is just genuinely an asshole though</a>.

<ul><li> God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit go golfing. The Holy Spirit tees off with an OK shot that lands on the edge of the fairway and goes into the rough. Jesus does a great drive that lands square on the green. God takes a long time to set up, then hits a terrible drive that ricochets off a tree and goes towards the water. Just before it lands in the water, a fish leaps out of the water and swallows the ball, then a heron swoops out of the sky and picks the fish up in its mouth and flies off towards the rough. The heron squeezes the fish, which spits the ball out. The ball falls towards the water, only to be caught by a passing raven which veers back towards the course and lands in a sand trap. The raven leaves the ball in the sand, and a squirrel runs into the sandtrap, picks up the ball, carries it to the hole and drops it in. Whereupon Jesus turns to God and says "Are you going to play golf, or are you going to fuck around?"

The Vikings all jump, then another opening in the clouds appear, and an even louder voice exasperatedly booms, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">LOKI</a>, WHY THE F**K!?"

The other <em>valar</em> are just <em>lethargic</em> at best - and they have their own golden kids, Elves - and could not care less of Men.

Without asking for consent beforehand. Ward is <em>quite</em> disgruntled about this use of his sister, and the pain the god inflicted on Oreg, who tried, but failed to protect Ciarra from this. As gods are gods, Ward's only means of showing his anger is to not pray to that specific god anymore.

Howard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> pulp stories, Conan's pantheon itself seems to qualify. The only god ever named by Conan out of his own pantheon (though he is happy to take the names of other pantheons' gods in vain) is Crom. Conan explains it in detail in <em>Queen of the Black Coast</em>: <span class="font-s">"He dwells on a great mountain. What use to call on him? Little he cares if men live or die. Better to be silent than to call his attention to you; he will send you dooms, not fortune! He is grim and loveless, but at birth he breathes power to strive and slay into a man's soul.

They also play games with the lives of men, but first they have to get the board out, and look all over the place for the dice.
<ul><li> Special mention goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero">Nuggan</a>, a small, unimportant bureaucratic god most notable for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Patron God of Borogravia</a>.

"Devout Nugganites try not to look at it these days.")

</li></ul></li><li> The Wild Gods of the <em>Broken Balance Series</em> (and, by extension, the visual novels based off the Broken Balance universe) vary but are mostly this. Given that they embody human emotions that run the gamut and generally embody the extremeties of said emotions, they more or less are this by default, and more than live up to their names. Examples of dangerous and very active gods in the setting include:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy">Mallion</a>, the God of Greed, who is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> than anything but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose descendants, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Kallias Jeridar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber">Reuben Jeridar</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Arken Jeridar</a>, are two villains and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> in the visual novel <em>Serafina's Saga</em> before all of them pull at least a partial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> in the sequel</span>,

Loki is willing to start interracial, genocidal war to win a bet with Badb, who, in turn, sends protagonist bad dreams and scares her with visions of her dead friends (not that Badb cares, she just want to win the bet). Cahan (werewolf goddess) shoehorns Dora into almost taking over entire werewolf clan and forces reluctant werewolves to bow to her. Anubis kidnaps and mummifies young women to "keep them with him" forever. List goes on.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>:
<ul><li> Amongst the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> gods of the created by Lovecraft, technically just Nyarlathotep counts. The others aren't the least bit concerned about humans, or maybe don't even know of our existence, being mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot">mindless, chaotic abstractions</a>. But Nyarlathotep seems to love to dick around with humans, typically demanding human sacrifices when summoned, even though he almost certainly doesn't need them for anything, and occasionally giving humans some extra chances to destroy ourselves, even though he could destroy us effortlessly if he really wanted. It seems that he doesn't care about outcomes — he just likes to dick around.
<ul><li> This is a somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> description used by later writers. In Lovecraft's original works Nyarlathotep stands in the way of humans who seek forbidden knowledge more often than not, although he can be persuaded to be a little more lenient with human sacrifices. On the other hand, in his first appearance, before Lovecraft had figured out what to do with him, he was basically the embodiment of scientific progress, and drives humanity mad by overwhelming them with cosmic knowledge.
</li><li> This is the approach used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> webcomic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheCallOfWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheCallOfWhatever">The Call of Whatever</a></em>, and once humanity starts jerking Nyarlathotep around in turn (thanks to Occultech's helpline boosting cultist survival/success rates), he quits his job. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">This was more Jerkassish than you would think.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The gods of Earth, or the Great Ones from Lovecraft's Dreamland-stories also qualify. They tend to be petty, selfish and short-tempered. Partially this is due to the way humanity threatens their very existence with their insatiable curiosity, but there's little excuse to how they steal Randolph Carter's magnificent city from him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDreamQuestOfUnknownKadath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDreamQuestOfUnknownKadath">The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</a></em> just because they want it for themselves, and justify it as "divine wisdom". This story, it's worth noting, is tonally uncharacteristic of Lovecraft, being more of an epic fantasy adventure than the type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a> he's best known for.
</li><li> The stories of Lovecraft's friend and colleague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkAshtonSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkAshtonSmith">Clark Ashton Smith</a>, though technically part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, are also generally more conventional swashbuckling fantasy adventure yarns, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths">Hyperborea</a> stories in particular are full of gods who come across less like unfathomable forces of apocalyptic destruction and more like the small-minded jerks you get in most real-world mythologies. A great example of this can be found in his short story "The Seven Geases", which takes us on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">darkly comic</a> tour of some of Hyperborea's gods and their lairs, most of which, Mount Olympus-style, are in the cave complex beneath a single mountain - beings like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Tsathoggua, The Sleeper of N'Kai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Abhoth, The Source of Uncleanliness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">Atlach-Nacha, the Spider God</a>, who come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> at worst, and mildly grouchy at best. The encounters build on each other with the episodic, repetitive rhythms of a fairy tale or nursery rhyme (what Wikipedia calls a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_tale">cumulative tale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
</li></ul></li><li> The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek pantheon</a>, and most of the other creatures with god powers, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHunters">Dark Hunter</a></em> series.
</li><li> Lord Khersis, the primary human god in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU">Tales of MU</a></em>, once smote a confused little girl who was praying to him for guidance just because she was half-demon. And he's one of the nicer deities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em>, the Greek gods can often fulfill this trope, though some still manage to be sympathetic, via Freudian Excuse. (Hades, for example, has spent three millennia as the target of all the gods' Jerk-Assness and ostracism for ... drawing the unluckiest straw). It's also somewhat noticeable that more than a few of them are less jerkish than they used to be, with Poseidon and Artemis in particular coming off as much less jerkish than they classically are (though not without the implication they can in fact be jerks if need be), with even Ares and Hera having moments showing themselves to be less jerkish than in classical mythology (though with Hera, that's <em>really</em> not saying much. Hestia, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> in the myths, remains as such, but she's definitely an exception to the general rule.
<ul><li> The demigods, who are the protagonists of the series, also sometimes resent their parents for being Jerk Asses and ignoring them; the gods are eventually called out on it and forced to acknowledge all their children. (Whether this had any effect on how many affairs the gods have remains to be seen). Hermes also implies that the gods are constrained by the Fates from being able to spend too much time with their kid.
</li><li> Zeus takes the cake, though. Zeus (and Poseidon, to be fair) pressure Hades into a pact that they will no longer have demigod children due to the destruction their kids caused in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>... and also 'cause there's a prophecy saying one of them will choose to either save or destroy the world upon turning sixteen. Once the pact is made, Zeus attempts to kill Hades' two remaining children who are under sixteen— Hades protects them, but Zeus does succeed in killing their mother and presumably any other bystanders. Fast forward about sixty years: Zeus is the first to break the pact, and because he's the god of justice and king of the gods, <em>gets none of the comeuppance.</em> His daughter, Thalia, is punished instead: she is under constant monster attack and makes her final stand mere feet away from safety, holding the monsters off so her friends can escape. Zeus turns her into a pine tree as she dies. (Although she is accidentally resurrected later.) Hades, ironically, turns out to be the only one of the three to honor the pact— all of his children seen in the series were born in the 1930s and either placed in a time warp or brought back from the dead.
</li><li> In the sequel series when someone asks why the gods even need the demigods, all the gods look like they just ate something terribly sour and bitter and rancid and Aphrodite answers "Don't you think we've been asking that ourselves for millennia?"
</li><li> It is telling that the companion book Percy Jackson's Greek Gods has a whole paragraph reminding the readers that the gods do not, in fact, give a damn about us. Sure we might be useful at times to get around the rules and stipulations they are supposed to live by (no going to each other's territory without being invited for example), but their attitudes range from "that kid who enjoys burning ants with a magnifying glass", through "the kid watching ants march by peacefully" (with us being the ants), up to "the class in general towards the class gerbil: kinda cute at the start, but gets old real quick, in more ways than one" (with us being the gerbil.) Sometimes, gods will genuinely try to help mortals and demigods...and then forget about them entirely, having done their Good Deed for the century. Apollo recounts how, during the French Revolution, he wanted to check in on his son Louis XI, then remembered that Louis had already been dead for decades.
</li><li> The Egyptian gods in Rick Riordan's next series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> are petty backstabbers who squabble and fight with the main characters even though they are the only ones in a position to stop all of reality from descending into Chaos, which would destroy them too. But it is mostly due to lacking a strong king. Once the divine power struggle is over the gods quickly come together to fight Apophis from the nicest of them to the worst of them. Unfortunately, the magicians themselves are still heavily divided and Apophis has vast armies of demons to aid him.
</li><li> The Gods of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseandtheGodsofAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseandtheGodsofAsgard">Magnus Chaseandthe Godsof Asgard</a></em> series are, similarly to the Egyptians above, less jerkish than the Olympians. However they can come off as 'Hush kids, the grownups are talking' at times, though it is somewhat entangled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> and they, unlike Zeus, will thank and reward you much easier and quicker (since, unlike the Greek gods, they know they're going to die).
</li></ul></li><li> Not only are the gods of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords">Book of Swords</a></em> jerkasses, but several of the swords have jerkass qualities themselves. I'm looking at you Coinspinner and Wayfinder.
</li><li> The demon Xanth in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> novels.
<ul><li> All of the greater demons (of which Xanth is one) in general; they are involved in a complex game with more similarities to Nomic than the classic Chess, and people are only rarely used as pawns in certain rounds - most of the time, they're not considered at all. Xanth actually undergoes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and becomes less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> over the course of the novels, eventually even falling in love.
</li></ul></li><li> All of the "new" gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em> are vicious, backbiting, and desperate for worship, and a few of the old gods (especially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Odin and Loki</span>) are, too.
</li><li> Almost all the Greek gods in Anne Ursu's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CronusChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CronusChronicles">Cronus Chronicles</a></em> (with the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Persephone</span>). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a demigod who wants to enslave humanity, and most of the other gods either don't care or are actively trying to revenge themselves on the heroes for standing up to them. In the end the heroine <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> blackmails the gods into leaving humanity alone</span>.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool">Jesus is way cool</a> in Christopher Moore's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lamb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lamb">Lamb</a></em> his father's reaction to Joshua's pleading for humanity is "Screw 'em".
</li><li> The first chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlenCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlenCook">Glen Cook</a>'s <em>Surrender to the Will of the Night</em> has one survivor of a scouting party return to report to the god that sent the party out—although the survivor had been driven mad by his experiences. "His god rewarded him as gods do. It devoured him."
</li><li> A number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt">Tom Holt</a>'s novels have jackass deities. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> is portrayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Grailblazers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Grailblazers">Grailblazers</a></em> as being not so much evil as prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">Moral Myopia</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, with two people being cursed to immortality for the incredibly minor sins of giving Jesus a pair of socks instead of frankincense or myrrh and failing to wash up for Him at the Last Supper. Other deities aren't treated a hell of a lot better; for example, the Greek pantheon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YeGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YeGods">Ye Gods</a></em> play "The Great Game", which seems to resemble Monopoly (with Earth as the board). At one point Demeter avoids paying tax assessments by flooding a major city. Wars, earthquakes, etc. are also just part of the Game.
</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a></em> gods seem to be this way, or at best they're a bit petty and tend to overreact. This isn't helped at all by the fact that they're pretty much stuck in that mindset with literally no way to change.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TillWeHaveFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TillWeHaveFaces">Till We Have Faces</a></em>, much like the Greeks, the people of Glome think of their gods as petty brutes and try to do as little to attract their attention as possible. The Fox, a Stoic philosopher from Greece, dismisses these ideas as "lies of poets" and considers the Divine to be above such pettiness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, both views are wrong, in different ways</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon">Fantasy Pantheon</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shadowmarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shadowmarch">Shadowmarch</a></em> is heavily inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> (to the point that the three head gods are clear expies of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades) and as such the majority of them are portrayed this way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or rather, were- Kupilas, the Hephaestus-analogue, eventually got fed up with them and succeeded in tricking them all into hibernation- only a few demigods and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Zosim the trickster</a> are still active</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles">Iron Druid Chronicles</a></em> the Norse gods are portrayed like this, especially Thor who is a supernatural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> to everyone outside his pantheon. Odin is a bit of a mix. While he is suggested to have manipulated several other pantheons to make sure the Norse remained on top by being remembered, he never actually goes out of his way to be a jerk to Atticus, even allowing Atticus to live after aiding in the collective fucking over that the Thor Revenge Squad dealt to the Norse. When the Morrigan took Atticus to meet with him and Frig he was a little bit of a jerk, but otherwise totally cordial. To be fair, Odin is speaking to the man who invaded his home, robbed him, killed his advisers, killed one of the residents of his realm, humiliated him, left, and then cam back with a kill-squad, resulting in the deaths of a rather large number of members of his family, and the implied rape of Freya. Being a "little bit of a jerk" and nothing more must take GODLY levels of restraint. And once he and Atticus actually start working together, he's actually a pretty good guy. If you pay him, or your interests align with his, he may even help you. Note: he likes to be paid in girl scout cookies. So he's really just your average adult.
<ul><li> The Roman gods colluded with Theophilus and the vampire nation to eradicate Druids, and when Bacchus finds out that Atticus is still alive he hightails it over to America to finish the job. The Greeks' involvement in the series has them largely doing their own thing, only opposing Atticus out of solidarity with the Romans.
</li><li> In contrast Jesus and the various versions of the Coyote are quite decent and care about humans (well, Coyote explicitly only cares about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">his</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">humans</a>, but it's the thought that counts).
</li><li> The gods that Atticus himself follows, the Tuatha de Dannan, have their ups and downs. They range from actively evil (Aenghus Og) to merely petty (Brighid) to actually pretty nice (Mannan mac Lir among others). In Goibhniu's first appearance this trope is lampshaded though Goibhniu himself is actually a subversion.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Atticus:</strong> Gods can screw anything and anybody. For reference, see history.
</div><ul><li> The Morrigan is a bit of a mixed bag. She's got a lot of the markings of a Jerkass God (temperamental, tendency to cause pain for various reasons, turned on by being feared) but is actually pretty nice and personable when she wants to be and is Atticus' oldest and most consistent ally.
</li><li> It is later revealed that the gods are pretty much stuck with the personalities that their worshippers attribute to them. The Morrigan becomes aware of this and actually wants to change for the better but cruelty and pain are so strongly associated with her worship that she is unable to see the world through any other metric. It is quite tragic and causes the Morrigan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> go out and get herself killed in battle.</span> The few times she manages to get around the "chains of belief", she's actually pretty sweet.
</li><li> This makes one wonder why Thor is such a sadist since all the stories about him were him being a hero and protector of the common people severely lacking his jerkish qualities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos">Chronicles of Chaos</a></em> explains this trope thusly: in this universe, moral laws and destinies have supernatural weight, and breaking or bending them carries penalties. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Olympians</a>, however, have the power to change those moral laws, which mean they aren't bound by them.

Of course, it might be because he already owns an entire realm and has no reason to be greedy.

<ul><li> Sun Wukong was such a jerkass god that even the other gods went to Buddha and begged him to put a stop to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">monkey business</a>. On the other hand, most of his jerkass tendencies were directed at the other gods-he cared for his monkey brethren and didn't bother humanity before being sealed in the mountain-and that was because they were jerkasses towards him. It didn't excuse his behavior and he became a much better individual throughout his journey.
</li><li> Buddha himself. It may not seem so obvious at first, but it becomes pretty clear that he is one when you think about it. Before he punished Wukong, Buddha made a bet with him, which went like this; <em>Sun Wukong must first jump onto Buddha's palm, He must then leave Buddha's palm and fly to the edge of the universe, if Sun Wukong accomplishes this, he shall be the new ruler of Heaven.</em> So the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunWukong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunWukong">Monkey King</a> puts his all into it, and after reaching what he believes to be the edge of the universe, marked by five giant pillars, then flys back to Buddha in order to claim Heaven, ONLY TO BE TOLD that he never left Buddha's hand, due to the fact that the <strong>'ENTIRE UNIVERSE</strong>' rest in the palm of Buddha's hand, and then was sealed under a Mountain for 500 years and only given Iron Balls to eat and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mercury">Mercury</a> to drink as part of his aforementioned punishment. Sound fair so far? Well while Wukong was a those giant pillars, he signed his name on one of them to prove he'd been there, then went around to the other side of it and peed on it, when he goes back to Buddha it's revealed that the "pillars" were in fact Buddha's fingers, <em><strong>This means that Sun Wukong successfully left Buddha's palm and went to the edge of the universe, a palm CAN'T exist on both sides of the fingers.</strong></em>
<ul><li> Another version has Buddha using his powers to cloud Wukong's mind to stop him from going anywhere, <strong>which is pretty much the same thing as slipping someone a mickey to stop them from completing their part of the bet. i.e. cheating.</strong>
</li><li> A final version has Wukong actually going to the "pillars", but just peeing on a different pillar, <em>but one could could agure that he still won because he did technically make it to the edge other universe.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Another case of Buddha being a jerkass was the time he had his men fly Tripitaka and Co. back to China, but before they were home, Buddha asked how many disasters they had suffered on their way to him, after finding out it was 80 Buddha decided to have them go through another one just because 9 was Buddism's lucky/holy number and 9x9 is 81 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nun2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1nun2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nun2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> They didn't even NEED to experience another disaster, Buddha just wanted them to</span>, so he orders his men to drop them without consulting Tripitaka and Co.

</li><li> It's implied that the real God (the actual creator, who does exist in the supernatural universe) has shades of this, as its commonly pointed out, especially by Dean Winchester, that despite being all-powerful and all-knowing, he idly sits by letting so many horrors occur every day to innocent people and it turns out he actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">abandoned his children</a> (the angels) shortly after Lucifer's rebellion, leading the majority of them who were still (the equivalent of) children in the ruins of heaven. This probably also explains why his three eldest (Lucifer doesn't count as he was already evil before this) have so many problems, Gabriel ran off and pretends to be a Pagan, Raphael is a completely uncaring jerk who doesn't even care for his own kind, and Michael is a fanatic who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">obsessed with pleasing his absent father</a>.

When her dying worshipers asked why she had done this after they did their best to honor her, she replied, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">Because I can.</a>" Apparently, this is why the modern-day Peacekeepers refuse to believe in any religion.

</li><li> Similarly, the Ancients themselves might qualify. Sure, they're the "good guy" counterparts of the Ori, but despite their power and Ascended status, they have rules against interfering with the affairs of mortals, up to and including letting a half-Ascended Goa'uld run around slaughtering billions and gaining a foothold into destroying the <em>entire galaxy</em> just to punish one of their own for helping him Ascend on accident.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Mythology and Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> According to religion researchist Yehezekel Kaufmann and psychohistorian Lloyd deMause, this trope is omnipresent in <em>all</em> Polytheistic religions: their deities are not benevolent nor nice entities, but whimsical and malevolent bullies or outright tyrants which treat mortals with contempt and which the mortals need to constantly placate to be safe from their wrath or whims. This is severely undermined by the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology">Mesopotamian</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Egyptian</a> and yes, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek</a> literature in which worshippers express love for their deities, which clearly shows they didn't all have such a view. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> even wanted such depictions to be banned, as they were blasphemous to him.
</li><li> The gods of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> are widely remembered today for being spoiled children with fancy powers at best and total assholes at worst. Part of this is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderizing</a> their jerk side and ignoring their benevolent side combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">They were held to different standards from humans</a> and were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">center of the universe</a> instead of humans. The other reason is they often were just massive jerks because they could be. Even the best of them have one or two stories like this, with a few exceptions.
<ul><li> The only exceptions tended to be Hades, Hermes, Demeter, Hephaestus, Hestia and Athena (and even then, they had some questionable moments of their own too). Hades due to hanging out in the underworld all the time (thus not being in a position to get involved in the divine douchebaggery) and being one of the most law-abiding, not to mention (reasonably) fair. Unfortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Everybody Hates Hades</a> and in modern works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken">he is often portrayed as being</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> due to him ruling the Underworld, when in Greek myth Hades was more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who just happened to be the manager of the garbage dump everybody hates. Hermes, although a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">mischievous Trickster</a>, tends to punish only the unjust and the hubristic, and gets by on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Also, it should be noted that he tends to help heroes a lot in Greek mythology and to assist them if they need anything, so hes got that going for him too. Hestia was the most peaceful and is hardly involved in any myths probably because non-jackass gods are less interesting (on the flip side, she probably was the most trusted and prayed-to of all the Olympians—the hearth and family are kind of a big deal). Hephaestus also tends to be one of the nicer ones; despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the gods, he never took it out on mortals (perhaps he was too busy smithing, or maybe he just always thought "Hey, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">I married Aphrodite</a>!"). Demeter is also a good<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ah6i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ah6i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ah6i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if wrathful—recall the story of Persephone</span> mother and even acted as a nanny at one point to a mortal baby. Not to mention that even Demeter has her bad side too - most of which happened when she was searching for Persephone. Other times, her wrath was incurred more by people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">provoking</a> it or being a jerkass first. Athena, like her uncle Hades, tended to stay out of the petty squabbles of her family (unless she absolutely needed to get involved for one reason or another) because being the goddess of wisdom, she knew that bullying mortals or other gods was not a good idea. Also, like Hermes, she helps heroes on their journey by lending them a hand and giving them guidance from time to time. Shes also portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> to her younger siblings, because she often gives them guidance too and if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralBastard">Heras not their mother</a>, then Athena will often discreetly protect them from Heras <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">murderous wrath and jealousy</a> (Heracles/Hercules being a good example of that, from when Hera wanted him dead and Athena had to step in and take measures to protect him when he was a baby).
</li><li> One of the worst is Zeus, who ironically is the god of law and upholder of morals. While there are some stories of Zeus punishing evildoers and rewarding the just, many of his stories are about his dalliances with immortal and mortal women. He has a lecherous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester">Memetic Molester</a> infamy due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">forcing himself</a> upon women, doing little to protect them and their "divine rapechildren" from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> wife, Hera. Add to that his other highly questionable actions, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox">Pandora's Box</a> incident, and he is perhaps the biggest asshole of all. Of course, many of these myths are fairly transparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory">Just So Stories</a>, particularly the "divine rapechildren" stories (most of which result in Zeus being the ancestor of a people or a royal house of some Greek city or other<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4lkrn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4lkrn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4lkrn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Zeus as a swan with Leda? Legitimacy for the royal house of early Sparta. Zeus and Alcmene? Legitimacy for the story of Heracles, from whom so many Greek royal houses claimed descent (including both of the royal families of the classical Spartan state of the Lycurgan constitution). Zeus and Eurymedusa as ants? Ancestors of the Myrmidon (literally "ant") people. Zeus and Europa with that whole bull thing? Allowed the kings of Crete to claim divine ancestry. Zeus impregnating Danaë with a "shower of gold" to beget Perseus? Legitimacy for the royal house of Mycenae. Zeus and Antiope? Part of the story of Amphion and Zethus, who built the walls of Thebes.</span>) and of course the Pandora's Box incident was an explanation for why bad things happen to good people (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">why women shouldn't be trusted</a>).
</li><li> Also worth a mention is Ares. Even back then, Greek scholars wrote about how men run in terror from this bloodthirsty god of war. However, Ares's bloodlust only showed during wartime, he has never been portrayed as a rapist, and was always depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaBear">Papa Bear</a>, unlike his father Zeus. He was portrayed more positively by the Romans however, due to them having a stronger military tradition than the Greeks. In the Iliad, the phrase Homer uses to refer to Ares is <em>kukleion athanaton</em>: Evil Undying.
</li><li> This is kind of magnified compared to other pantheons where the gods tended to have human problems (Greek gods do not, being immortal) or at least created most of the world they jerked around in (nope, the Olympians just took over and decided not to destroy humanity, the Titans's creation). To be fair, most of the unprovoked jerkassery is restricted to the Olympians. Deities like Selene, Hypnos, Aether and even the likes of Nyx and Tartarus were for the most part content to mind their own business.
</li><li> While the Titans were generally nicer to humanity than the Olympians, their patriarch still ate his own children (the Olympians), so the Olympians being jerkasses to the Titans' creation is not so surprising.
</li><li> Eris, goddess of strife and discord, like her name suggests, promotes quarrel and conflict for no specific reason. Her most notorious act was making a golden apple dedicated "to the most beautiful goddess" which caused a quarrel between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, which triggered the chain of events that led to the Trojan War.
</li><li> This is a conflicting issue. Yes, gods can be assholes caring only about themselves... and they can be absolutely fair and nice protectors of humanity. Zeus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">hell-bent on getting all women</a> (and some men) into bed, but also honorable. Hades is either honest and lawful, or morbidly misanthropic. Ares is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">addicted to battle</a>, but one of the few gods that protect their demigods and has a reputation for hunting rapists. Aphrodite has two aspects, Pandemos-aspect of lust and sex, and Urania-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove">aspect of deep spiritual love/</a> Titans either started a golden age of humanity or we didn't exist when they were around. And given that both first of Olympians and Titans were eaten by their father, whose mother (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">and wife</a>) rose out of primal Chaos well...Greek Mythology is heavy on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">inconsistencies,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">different approaches to characters,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">fatal family issues,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">long-spanning vendettas.</a>

<ul><li> Odin, while generally a good guy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">sometimes comes off as a massive jerk</a>. Sure, he generally likes people and helps them, but he's not trustworthy, prone to have his devoted or especially competent followers killed in messy ways <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">so they join him in Valhalla.</a> Sure, it's for the best, but losing the favor of the god you faithfully serve and fight for mid-battle would surely suck. Interestingly, the Norse seemed to acknowledge this aspect as he is called both "<em>Deceiver</em>", "<em>Swift Tricker</em>" and "<em>Ruler of treachery</em>" in poems.
<ul><li> Even his reasons for having his favored warriors join him in Valhalla are suspect. He doesn't get them killed in battle so that they can have a great afterlife. He gets them killed in battle because the rules say that's the only way you get to come to his hall in the afterlife, and he needs all the help he can get for the upcoming battle at the end of the world. That he already knows he's fated to lose and nothing he can do can possibly change that. (Even being a <em>god</em> can suck in this mythos.)
</li><li> Small wonder Loki is involved in Ragnarok seeing what Odin did to his family. Fenrir, Hel, and Jörmungand were imprisoned with Sleipnir, in Niflheim, and beneath the sea respectively for basically no reason beyond "we foresaw that they would cause a lot of trouble" (which they did when released, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">because they were pissed at being imprisoned</a>) and when Loki was bound beneath the earth (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">which he did deserve</a>, in theory at least) the chains binding him were made from the intestines of his youngest son, whose twin brother Odin forced to kill for their father's crimes.
</li><li> Fenris was actually briefly kept as a guard dog by Odin before being chained by Gleipnir. He took exception to that and it became apparent as he grew that keeping him as a glorified pet might not have been the best idea. This, combined with the previously mentioned prophecies of his role in Odin's death caused them the forge the three chains.
</li><li> Another example: Thor returns from Jotunheim after fighting giants, and needs to cross a river. Odin disguises himself as an old man, and refuses to take him across. While Thor boasts about slaying giants and protecting Midgard, Odin brags about how many women he had sex with in the meantime. Eventually Thor gets tired of it and leaves.
</li><li> There was this one time where a dwarf(who, in this mythos, turn to stone if sunlight hits them) wanted to marry Thor's daughter. Rather than just dealing with it and being happy for his daughter, or even just forbidding it, or refusing it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>) Thor told him that he could, but only if he beat him in a battle of wits. The dwarf agreed, not knowing that Thor had specifically set up the battle of wits at such a time that it would last until sunrise, outside. Guess who turned to stone? Hint: not Thor
</li></ul></li><li> Freyr sending his servant to threaten Gerd's family until she marries him. But that ended but biting him in the ass since he lost his magic sword in the process with some scholars thinking that the sword ended up in the hands of Surtr...
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SorlisTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SorlisTale">Sorli's Tale</a>" paints a rather unfavorable image of the Aesir, with Freyja as a floozie who sleeps with four dwarfs in exchange for a necklace, Odin as her jealous sugardaddy, and Loki as Odin's conniving lackey. The tale relates how Freyja, on a challenge of Odin, caused the Everlasting Battle between the kings Hedin and Hogni. None of the gods shows any qualms about the suffering and the destroyed lives caused by their actions.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology">Shinto pantheon</a> wasn't free from its share of jerks. Given that there's around 8 million gods in the Shinto pantheon, that's not exactly surprising....
<ul><li> When the goddess Izanami died from birthing Kagutsuchi, the god of fire, her husband, Izanagi, chopped the fire spirit into eight pieces in a rage, even though Izanami in her death throes had birthed the water goddess Mizuhame and instructed her to watch over Kagutsuchi and pacify him if he ever got out of hand. Afterward, Izanagi traveled to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">Yomi</a> to save Izanami but when he saw that his wife had turned into a rotted corpse, Izanagi ran away in fear, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman">an enraged Izanami</a> pursuing him. Izanagi then pushed a boulder into the mouth of the cave which led into Yomi, trapping Izanami inside and out of anger she declared that if Izanagi did not remove the boulder, she would kill 1,000 of his people every day, to which Izanagi, instead of removing the boulder, shot back that he'd just give life to 1,500.
</li><li> Tsukuyomi was invited to a feast by Uke Mochi, the goddess of food, who made the food by turning into the ocean and spitting out fish, then facing the forest and having wild game come out of her anus, and finally turning into a rice paddy field and vomiting up a bowl of rice. Tsukuyomi, disgusted by the repulsive way the delicious meal came to be, killed Uke Moshi.
</li><li> Amaterasu and her brother Susanoo had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">antagonistic relationship</a>. After being ordered to leave the heavens by Izanagi, Susanoo bid his sister farewell before challenging her to prove his sincerity. They each took an item from another to birth gods and goddesses from them. From Susanoo's sword, Amaterasu birthed three women while from Ameratsu's necklace Susanoo birthed five men and declared himself the winner since he had produced five of them. When Amaterasu argued back that her necklace had produced the five men while Susanoo's sword could only produce three women, Susanoo went on a rampage, destroying his sister's rice paddies, defecating in her irrigation ditches, throwing fecal matter at her temple, and hurling a flayed horse at her loom, which splintered into hundreds of pieces, killing all her hand-maidens. Coincidentally, this is also the story of how Winter came about because it was at that point that Amaterasu proceeded to hide herself (and thus, the sun) in a cave to <em>get away from him</em>.
<ul><li> Unlike most deities, Susanoo actually faced repercussions for thisafter the other gods managed to pry Amaterasu out of her cave, they then proceeded to happily kick him out of heaven until he proved he wasn't completely worthless. This managed to get through to him, and he later slew the dragon Orochi as penance...and to score a wife. He's still a jerk, he's just a <em>mature</em> jerk now.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, after slaying Orochi, Susanoo took a sword from inside its body and gave to Amaterasu as a conciliatory gift, suggesting that he at least became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note55uhu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note55uhu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note55uhu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This sword later became one of the three royal treasures of Japan.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Ookuninushi, while generally seen in a positive light, is actually quite the jerkass. When Amaterasu requested that he hand over the country to her descendants, he seemed alright with it and agreed to do it. Then, several generations later, he caused a plague during emperor Suujin's reign, demanding a new temple to end it. Doing so stopped the plague, but the god was apparently still angry, because he then made the next emperor's son dumb, requiring the emperor to build another temple to him.
</li></ul></li><li> Indra from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Hindu Mythology</a> fits this trope. Whenever someone — be it human, God or demon — gained too much power, Indra would send the beautiful dancing girls from his court to upset their prayers. He also has a bad habit of raping sages' wives by disguising himself as their husbands.

<ul><li> Ishtar (later counterpart to Inanna, who appeared in the Sumerian stories underlying the Epic) is highly untrustworthy, and has the tendency of turning her lovers into moles and beasts when she's tired of them. And when Gilgamesh refused to sleep with her, she sent a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">angry bull</a> (but not before warning that if the other gods don't let her send the bull she will open the gates of the Underworld and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">the dead with outnumber the living</a>) to destroy Uruk.

</li></ul></li><li> Freaking every single one of them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/AztecMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/AztecMythology">Aztec Mythology</a> (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Quetzalcoatl</a>, and even he had his moments). When your <em>rain and fertility god</em> likes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">food</a> young and crying, and one of two rulers is literally the god of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a>, there's little wonder why they thought it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.
<ul><li> Even Quetzalcoatl kinda sucks, since he would be much nicer to humanity than the current top god in the pantheon if he was to retake that place...but retaking that place would also completely destroy the world and kill every living thing, forcing him to start from scratch.

<ul><li> The deities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> &amp; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. <strong>All</strong> of them. Canon does <em>sometimes</em> seem contradictory on this point, though.
<ul><li> Khorne wants to see people fight battles, the bloodier and more gruesome the better. In the Warhammer universes, simply being a god of war makes him a possible good guy, while the fact that <em>your</em> viscera would be just as pleasing to him as your enemies makes him one of the bad guys.
</li><li> Slaanesh might want to help you to experience every positive sensation that you can, even turning negative sensations into new kinds of pleasure... but he/she/it <strong>definitely</strong> wants to <em>force</em> you to experience <em>everything</em>, as a kind of torture-orgy.
</li><li> Papa Nurgle either wants you to help you to accept the pain and suffering of existence in the Warhammer universes, even nullifying some of the effects for you... so that you will be grateful enough to help him "spread the love" by infecting healthy people with incurable diseases and unhealing wounds to help them see how bad the universe is, so that they will turn to Grandfather Nurgle and he can help <em>them,</em> too. Oh, and he's holding the lone subversion of this trope - Isha - captive, and experimenting with plagues on her.
</li><li> Tzeentch <em>definitely</em> is a Jerkass God, because he is the god of scheming to such an extent that <em>anything</em> good <em>or</em> bad in the Warhammer universe is his doing. His grand master-plan was responsible for every single happy moment of your life...and every single moment of negativity of any kind.
</li><li> Bloody-handed Khaine is the Eldar god of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">war and conflict</a> <em>and murder</em>. He was a reckless and brutal jerk of a god who was cursed to have blood forever drip from his hands after he murdered a mortal Eldar hero. In any other setting he would be a candidate for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Here, he's one of the closest things the Eldar have to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a></em>, as the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> of the Eldar Pantheon is dead.
</li><li> Cegorach the Laughing God is pretty much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> god of deception, stealth, creativity, art and trickery. He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester">The Jester</a> of the Eldar Pantheon, spending all of his time mocking everything. On the other hand, he's also one of the closest things the Eldar have to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> since he and his servants the Harlequins guard the secrets of the Black Library from the forces of Chaos, and most of the targets of his trolling really deserve it. He's a bit like Tzeentch, albeit with a slightly better sense of humor.
</li><li> The God Emperor of Mankind may or may not have been a true deity (he denied it but the present day Imperium worship him as one anyway) but he was an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a> <em>at best</em>. During his campaign to unite the galaxy under human rule he cause the deaths of billions, xeno and human alike. He also had a lot of trouble relating to others as actual people and had a tendency to keep secrets even when it was a bad idea. His inability to be a proper parent to many of the Primarchs such as Angron, Lorgar, and Magnus, played a huge part in ending the Imperium's golden age. Also, because the beliefs of large groups of sentient beings tends to become the truth in the Warp, he may be a true god yet.
</li><li> Gork and Mork are just a pair of thugs. One likes to hit people when they aren't looking, and the other hits people really hard whether they're looking or not. Fortunately, their worshipers are Orks, a race of thugs whose lives center around hitting people and wandering the cosmos to look for new people to hit. By their standards, their gods are perfectly reasonable. Nobody else in the galaxy would agree with them.
</li><li> The C'Tan are evil star gods who gave the Necrons the means to conquer the galaxy while simultaneously enslaving them. The Night Bringer instilled the fear of death into the sentient races, the Outsider is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Mad God</a> that anybody in their right mind would steer clear of, the Deceiver is another malevolent trickster who helped with the destruction of most of his own brethren, and the Void Dragon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicAbomination">Draconic Abomination</a> who would rupture the Imperium if he were ever released from his prison on Mars.
</li><li> Subverted with Isha, the Eldar Mother Goddess, who survived the Fall as Nurgle's prisoner/disease Guinea pig. However, whenever he isn't looking, she whispers the cures to Nurgle's plagues to mortals. Now imagine the Hell that must be her life: she's in literal Hell, held captive by her antithesis, who routinely infects her with every malicious sickness that he can think of, then he waits until she cures herself, then uses his observations upon whatever methods she used to cure herself to make his next disease "harder to cure". And all she can do is watch. Whenever Nurgle glances away, she does everything in her power to tell mortals how to cure all of the horrible diseases and plagues that he's developed and released with "her help", however unwilling. Then remember the state of the galaxy as a whole, and guess how often she isn't brushed of as a demon trying to subvert them.
</li></ul></li><li> Many gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> have grown corrupt and complacent without anyone to answer to.
<ul><li> The Usurpation came to be because the Golden Age Solars had turned into this, as well.
</li><li> And even before becoming the Yozi and Neverborn, most of the Primordials were selfish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a> who, when they weren't playing the Games of Divinity while the Gods did all the actual work, amused themselves by tormenting the inhabitants of Creation or their ugly brother Autochthon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SenZar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SenZar">SenZar</a></em> offers too many examples of this trope to count (including, potentially, evil player characters who ascend to godhood), but the prize for <em>most</em> jerkassness goes to the Eternals, the only type of gods who actually gain (even more) power for being complete jackasses.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Time of Troubles led to all of the gods banished to the material plane in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">avatar form</a>, screwing up the Realms pretty much wherever they went. Many of them used this as an opportunity to expand their power base, using human armies as pawns to take down other gods. The kicker is that the whole thing started because they upset the overgod, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster">Ao</a>, by stealing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Tablets of Fate</a>. To his credit, after the whole fiasco is over Ao does require that deities actually be worshipped to get their power in the future. And hey, we got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">new edition</a> out of it.
</li><li> At least according to some sources, Ao was getting tired of the gods goofing off to play power games against each other instead of doing their actual jobs, anyway. The theft of the Tablets was simply the straw that broke the camel's back (and made for conveniently collectable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> at the same time). And the Kicker? The Tablets of Fate were just symbolic. Ao ground them to dust in front of the other Gods just to show that all that suffering was for nothing.
</li><li> Back when Myrkul was the god of death, he created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">Wall of the Faithless</a>, a place where every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a> has their soul slowly turned into nothing. When Kelemvor ascended to the position, he decided to abolish that, and judge souls based on their deeds in life. This led to good people stopping their worship, while evil people became obsessed with cheating death. The other gods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">were so pissed</a> that they forced Kelemvor to bring back Myrkul's system. Hope you're cool with religion, cause if you don't, your soul is doomed.
</li><li> Corellon the Leader of the Elvish Pantheon is argueably one of the worst gods on the side of good in the dnd multiverse. Despite his chaotic good alignment Corellon is a infamously petty and emotional god whose spontaneous outbursts have caused serious damage to the elves He cheated Gruumsh and the Orcs out of a homeland causng orcs and gruumsh to become the chaotic evil murderers they are known as today. When Lolth attempted to overthrow him he cursed every single elf who did not take his side in the battle of the gods and condemned the entire drow race to suffer under Lolth's hand, he refuses to create more elvish souls which is causing the elvish race to slowly go extinct. All in all his behavior is not evil but as a King and A God he is not suited to ruling.
</li><li> Even if you worship a god, your fate is arguably not any better. Souls that die are sent to the Fugue Plane, where they become petitioners. If you worshipped a god in life, they would (hopefully, there is no guarantee) come to pick you up as a servant. Once a god has claimed you, you lose all your skills and attributes, become mindless, and have your body remodeled into whatever your god finds amusing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PlayingGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PlayingGods">Playing Gods</a></em> gets this trope right. You play as one of the five major gods from the major religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism) or you can use the sixth stand and insert a sticker or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a photo of yourself</a> or use a key ring or action figure or whatever as a god too. You convert other gods' sects, spread believers or massacre every other deity's sects. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> though, and it's really a satire of fundamentalism and religious warfare and how it's better to be at peace with your fellow religions rather than attack them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> makes use of this trope. In general, if the mythology portrays a god/dess as a jerkass, then he/she is the same in Scion. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> between modern culture and mythology is also given a few subtle nods, the most obvious of which is that, by the "God" sourcebook, the official sample Aztec character is depicted as disgusted by and disdainful of his native pantheon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em>, Menoth, creator god of the human race, is such a massive jerk that two humans became gods just to overthrow him. It's not hard to see why as he supports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a> (most punishments <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">having something to do with fire</a>) and the fact that if you're too awesome <em>he will kill you</em>. Why? So you can fight for him in his heavenly army because he's attacking the other gods' cities. Why? Because he's a jerk.

He believes they are all monsters who do nothing but cause misery for mortals. He is most ashamed of himself and what he did with his power when he was a god. This strains his relationship with his son Atreus because he has tried to keep Atreus' heritage hidden from him. It doesn't help that the Norse gods don't seem to be any better than the Olympians.

The Daedric Princes are the most powerful of the Daedric beings, immortal entities who existed prior to the creation of Mundus, the mortal plane, and who did not sacrifice any of their power to help create Mundus (as the Aedra did).

<ul><li> Azura, Daedric Prince of Dusk and Dawn, is generally seen as one of the most benevolent of the Daedric Princes.

She also prophesied the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of Nerevar who would cast down the "false gods". In the plot of <em>Morrowind</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Nerevarine</a> may not actually be Nerevar's reincarnation, but simply a convenient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a> for Azura <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">to get her revenge on the Tribunal</a></span>.

Her actions just happen to benefit mortals more often than not by stopping divine threats.
</li><li> Meridia, the Daedric Prince associated with the "energy of living things," is another who is generally considered "good," but has some very jerkass qualities as well. She has a hatred of all things undead and seeks to rid them from the world, which is usually a good thing for living mortals.

He may be the Daedric Prince most active in aiding his followers, and in every appearance is shown to care about them deeply. However, he <em>is</em> completely insane. Seemingly at random, he can fluctuate between being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGod">Jerkass God</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo">Great Gazoo</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyInconvenientDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyInconvenientDeity">Incredibly Inconvenient Deity</a>, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>. He's been known to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">hurl celestial bodies</a> at those who've offended him, or simply make cheese rain from the sky on a whim. In The Oblivion expansion <em>The Shimmering Isles</em>, Sheogorath has been known to sentence people to death for growing beards, played jumprope with the entrails of someone who had his undying loyalty, and immediately threatens a subordinate he suspects of betraying them with ripping out their eyes. Thankfully by the time of <em>Skyrim</em> Sheogorath has mellowed out significantly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to being the probably-heroic Champion of Cyrodiil who ascended to godhood and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing">became the new Sheogorath</a></span>, in fact he even helps repair the mentality of a former emperor he cursed with madness, allowing his spirit to finally rest in peace.

(He is a believer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>, and he knew that all attempts to stop the true Nerevarine would be destined to fail, confirming his identity.)
</li><li> In the <em>Bloodmoon</em> expansion, Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt, is a Downplayed example. He does kidnap the greatest warriors on Solstheim for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">"hunt"</a>, but he also gives plenty of warnings, prophecies, signs, and such that it is time for the hunt. When a finalist emerges from his hunting grounds to challenge him directly, he also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">gives that person a sporting chance</a> by fighting him at significantly reduced (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass">still incredibly strong for a mortal</a>) strength.

Furthermore, their ability to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic">the Thu'um</a> allows them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">bend reality</a> to their very will. During the Merethic Era they caused untold destruction across all of Tamriel before they were driven to extinction and their leader, Alduin is prophesied to be the one to ultimately destroy the world. Multiple characters make the point that Alduin's destruction of the world and consumption of everyone's souls is an inevitability, it's unfortunate but it's a natural part of the world's lifecycle, but he has no excuse to be enslaving people instead of killing them, and he's thousands/hundreds of thousands of years too early and killing time by tormenting humanity to begin with.

Her aim was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">gather faith</a> at the expense of <em>possibly destroying Gensokyo</em>, since she was trying to take it from the Hakurei Shrine, who maintain the boundary that protects the last sanctuary of magic from <em>the real world where magic is dead</em> (admittedly, Kanako being a goddess from said outside world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">she might not have realized the importance of the Hakurei Border</a>)... Later on, her jerkass traits are played with. While pretty manipulative, she has every reason to be seen as a positive influence and is actively introducing outside world technology into Gensokyo.
</li><li> The Sinistrals in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia">Lufia</a></em> series of games fit this trope to a T.

To a lesser extent, Xom's fellow chaos god Makhleb also qualifies. He not only awards power and favor to his worshipers for killing everything under the sun (thus making life more miserable for <em>non</em>-worshipers), but he also grants the ability to summon demons (up to and including the most powerful non-unique demons in the game)... which have a chance of spawning hostile to the summoner!
</li><li> The Elder Gods of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia">Lusternia</a></em> each follow their own agenda. Some, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">Elostian</a>, are relatively benign; others, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Eventru</a>, less so; still others, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Fain</a>, veer into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> territory.

</li><li> Used as a gameplay mechanic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a></em>: there are ten Gods; choosing to pray to one will make enemies tougher to defeat, but increase the experience and money you get from beating them. Although in this case it's justified; before the cataclysm that kicked off the plot, your culture had lost most of its reverence for the gods, and turned them into toys and architectural decorations, so they're a little hacked off at you right now. On the other hand, if you should decide to reject them, they won't begrudge you that, because they think you're just pussing out.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ashera</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>. While she isn't exactly an immature jerk like most examples, she proves to have an extreme view of how the world should be and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends up turning almost everyone to stone when she awakens and sees the world doesn't match her vision.</span> Ironically, she was considered a benevolent goddess before that event, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her other half, Yune was considered evil, but ends up being much nicer and less extreme, though also a lot more emotional and childish</span>.
</li><li> Most of the Eastern Gods from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IzunaLegendOfTheUnemployedNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IzunaLegendOfTheUnemployedNinja">Izuna</a></em> duology (especially their leader, Takushiki) are none too happy with Izuna and her clan trespassing on the sacred Kamiari Shrine, and take their frustrations out on the villagers by placing them under various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curses</a>.
</li><li> The gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, for the most part, see their followers as little more than tools they can use to gain an advantage over the other gods. Even Saradomin, who is worshipped by most of the characters in-game, doesn't really seem to care much about his worshippers, and was actively participating in the God Wars without a second thought. The closest thing there is to a 'good' god is Guthix, the god of nature and balance, who created Gielinor and was powerful enough to stop the God Wars.
<ul><li> The cruelty of the gods in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> history of the universe is the roundabout reason for the populating of Gleinor, the world the game takes place in. Guthix was born a mortal but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">killed a God</a> who had killed his daughter through gross negligence. After he accidentally became a god, Guthix populated Gleinor with the hopes that it would be free of the fighting between the gods.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His death allows many gods to come to the realm and wage war again.</span>
</li><li> Most of the gods tend to be well-intentioned extremists, though several are more caring about the mortals who worship them. Seren committed suicide to prevent her elves from dying out, while Armadyl had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBsod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBsod">Heroic BSoD</a> when he thought his followers were wiped out.

Instead, he selfishly manipulates everyone else in a bid to increase his own power.
<ul><li> Subverted in that Gwyndolin is the leader of the Darkmoon Blades, assassins who specifically target sinners in Lordran. Doubly subverted in that a sinner can be a player who kills friendly NPC's, a player who invades and kills other players, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or anyone who has discovered the illusion of Anor Londo. To be fair, though, Gwyndolin only seeks to punish you for even having the audacity to attack the illusion of his long gone sister, Gwynevere.</span> The rest of his godly family has either abandoned him, died, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or gone insane.</span>
</li><li> And it turns out <em>Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight</em> is the biggest jackass of them all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the distant past, he and the other Lord Soul bearers fought against the dragons. Among these, the Dark Soul was unique in that it was a conduit to the Abyss, which existed in direct opposition to Gwyn's First Flame. Uncaring that their bearers, the Pygmy Lords, were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">completely loyal</a> to him, he had them all rounded up and sealed in the Ringed City, using his own youngest child as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Cosmic Keystone</a> to keep it sealed in time. Then he fed the Pygmy Lords' descendants, humanity, a sanitized version of history which placed him as King of the Gods and included nothing about the Dark Soul. When the First Flame started fading, the Dark Soul within the humans started reacting and created the Undead Curse in an effort to ensure the natural order Gwyn defied was upheld, and without the Abyss knowledge of the Lords, this led to era after era of suffering and misery.</span>

</li><li> Nyarlathotep and, depending on one's point of view, Philemon from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series.

</li><li> The Elder Gods from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>, where, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">when begged by Raiden for help against the invasion of Earthrealm</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">Outworld</a>, their response is "so sad, too bad, but we don't care about the genocide of an entire realm". Shao Kahn even mocks them by calling them "impotent worms".
<ul><li> They weren't much different in the previous games/timeline. When they were not being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">indifferent</a> to all but their own survival they tended to make things worse.

Thus Quan Chi used the amulet to free Shinnok, who then declares and unleashes his vengeance on his fellow Elder Gods who imprisoned him into the Netherrealm. Then its revealed in <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> that Kronika was the one responsible for cursing Shang Tsung in the first place!</span>. They promised to return to life Scorpion's clan in exchange for service, but resurrected them as the undead. They tend to screw characters (both good and evil) over in several endings throughout the games. And comments in the games and outside of them has stated the Elder Gods appointed Shao Kahn as the protector of Outworld. A position he used to gain control of the realm. The Elder Gods then are responsible for most of the major villains throughout the games.

Just like Kahn in the previous game, Shinnok mocks his fellow Elder Gods for their inaction and apparent cowardice. And after Shinnok is vanquished, Raiden, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn">feeling that the Elder Gods are more burden than help</a>, decides to take matters into his own hands by defending Earthrealm from <strong>ALL</strong> threats.

Their solution to this "problem"? Descend to earth and simply <em>massacre</em> human and demon alike. Of particular note is Varach of the Wars, who brags about how he keeps the world in cycles of war and peace so that the gods can harvest the energy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">the Timestream</a> from those who die, then give them time to reproduce before starting again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, even they are beaten in jerkassery by Fate...</span>

With such a tall order, your God would probably help you as much as possible to ensure success, right? Wrong. Sure, they can help you if you pray to them... as long as you don't do it too often. Pray without respecting a certain time limit since your last prayer, and your God will get angry. Get your God too angry, and they'll start punishing you, all the way up to <em>trying to kill you</em>. Sacrifices can mollify the God and reduce the time limit, though.

Granted you don't learn who he really is until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>, but as Solas, he seems to lack many of the more sinister traits the elves ascribe to him. Codex entries found at the Temple of Mythal even goes so far as to suggest that he was actually a God of Rebellion who got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a>, meaning he might lean closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursor</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsFlawed">God Is Flawed</a> than previously believed.

</li><li> Some of the information revealed in <em>Inquisition</em> heavily implies that the rest of the Elven Pantheon were not as benevolent as Dalish stories claim either. Mythal was pretty much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is why the rest of them killed her: she worried too much about the well-being of their people and got in the way of their desire for more power.

</li><li> The true nature of the Old Gods of the Tevinter Imperium is ambiguous, but each of them apparently tricked their high priests into invading the Golden City on his behalf, with negative consequences for everyone (including themselves).
</li><li> The main reason Solas approves of the idea of The Maker without believing in it is because The Maker <em>doesn't do anything</em>. True gods don't need to flaunt their power.
</li><li> The Maker can also fall into this, depending on the speaker, to the point where the interpretations of the Maker that make Him seem actually decent (such as Leliana's) tend to be semi-heretical. Chantry dogma holds that the darkspawn exist because the magisters of Tevinter invaded Heaven and got smacked down and turned into monsters; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of it seems to be true <em>except</em> the Maker's involvement, which is still ambiguous</span>. In other words, countless humans and dwarves have been killed in horrible ways or turned into monsters because of the admittedly abhorrent actions of a small group of Tevene magisters, none of whom even <em>could</em> have been dwarven because dwarves can't do magic. Then there's the Chantry explanation for demons existing, which is that the Maker screwed up when making spirits by not giving them the capacity for creation, dumped them like a sack of hot bricks and dedicated all His attention to mortals instead, leading many of the spirits to fester in resentment and turn evil. Most of His relationship with mortals seems to consist of turning His face from them, looking back for thirty seconds, and then returning to a stance of "no, screw you guys", meaning he is, at best, very passive-aggressive and deeply indifferent towards collateral damage.

<ul><li> The Gods created the world it seems for their own amusement as much as anything. Their squabbles the first time created the Snarl and ended up killing 1/4 of them and unmaking reality before they locked it up in the current world. When they remade it they made Clerics and a lot of cool monsters for them to help fight, but needed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> for them to kill for experience. All goblin races were created to be nothing more than easy experience points and defined as "Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a>" for the purposes of alignment and spells, no matter their actions. (Well, according to Redcloak anyway.) As a result, killing a Goblin child unable to comprehend good and evil is not an evil act (again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">according to Redcloak</a>). The motivation of the aforementioned Redcloak stems from him trying to give his people an equal footing.
</li><li> The Dark One (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">previously-mortal</a> god of the goblins) averts this in his dealings with his followers, but he's still willing to threaten the stability of the entire universe in order to force the other gods to make Goblins a PC race. Right-Eye however believes this is true, and renounced the Dark One because he thought (citing the many goblins who died for the cause) the Dark One cared more about revenge than about goblins.
</li><li> The Northern Gods attending the Godsmoot seem to bear out Redcloak's depiction, with many of the ostensibly Good gods supporting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ending the world and killing everyone on it</span> because it would be safer for them, personally.

</li><li> In <em>Monster Girl Encyclopedia</em>:
<ul><li> From various profiles, we can conclude that while the Chief God really loves humans, she hates monsters. It's possible that she created them with the intent of having an enemy for mankind to fight. On the other end, we have the Fallen God who believes in pleasure above all other things, and forcefully converts both human women and angels into its followers the same way as a succubus, causing them to desire the ultimate "reward" of being locked in eternal coitus with their mate in Pandemonium. Finally, the cyclopes were once deities, but fellow deities cursed them into monsters simply because <em>they have only one eye</em>.
</li><li> Translations of the official background material have also shown that Poseidon (who is a goddess in this setting) turned against the other gods and sided with the demon lord in part at least because the other gods were forcing her to make storms to reduce human populations and make them fear the sea.
</li><li> Also from the settings material, it turns out that the monsters are living creatures the Chief God created so that the population of humans could be easily controlled. The previous Demon Lords were control devices so that the gods could control the monsters. Whenever the population of humans got too high, the monsters would become incredibly vicious and begin killing large numbers of humans. Then when humans started to die out and the monsters became too numerous, the Chief God would grant humans incredible power, creating heroes, and send them to slay the Demon Lord. With the Demon Lord slain, the monsters would kill each other to decide the next Demon Lord, causing a rapid decrease in the monster population. This would go on until humans again became too prosperous, at which point a new Demon Lord would be born and take control of the Monsters. This process ran for several cycles until a Succubus fought her way to becoming the current Demon Lord, and started messing with the system.

</li></ul></li><li> Neptune of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> acts this way.
<ul><li> His son Triton in "Spongebob and The Clash of Triton" on the other hand actually did care about mortals and their affairs before his father locked him in a cage because he felt that trying to improve the lives of mortals was not befitting of a god. The thousands of years he spent locked away eventually turned Triton into a jerkass god as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The (freakish) version of God on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> could qualify too. Not only does He look like a spectacularly ugly cross between an orangutan and a hippopotamus, but He is cold-hearted and hypocritical in allowing Satan to take all human beings except for Mormons to Hell, despite Himself being a Buddhist - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">a religion that ultimately dispenses with the idea of God</a>. (Satan, however, couldn't be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">evil</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow">Discord</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. He's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">all-powerful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who can do pretty much anything he pleases. And just what does he use this power to do? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse">Turn Equestria into</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">chaos-stricken version</a> of its former self and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldGoneMad">drive everypony insane</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">his own amusement</a>. His initial appearance paints him more as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> than just a jerkass, but his characterization in "Keep Calm and Flutter On" falls squarely in line with this trope (unless you consider "spirit of chaos and disharmony" not close enough to explicitly-stated godhood, but there's no denying the "jerkass" part).
<ul><li> Tirek, the demonic centaur, from the same show as well, could qualify as well if not more-so. He's pretty much Equestria's equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, especially when he drained everypony in Equestria of their magic. He rules over Equestria with an iron hoof, destroys Twilight's beloved tree home, and tries to murder the mane six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. He's eviler than Discord as shown by him betraying Discord in a heartbeat and nearly <em>succeeding</em> in destroying Equestria.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord">Sorcerous Overlord</a> King Sombra seems to be this for the Crystal Empire. A millennium ago, he came seemingly out of nowhere and magically converted the entire place into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a>; oppressed the Crystal Ponies as his blatant, personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a>; and then, once Princesses Celestia and Luna came and overthrew him for the Crystal Ponies' sake, cursed the Empire to vanish as both spite for his imprisonment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a> to preserve "his" domain until his inevitable return. And in the Season 5 finale, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Futures</a> shows what would've happened if said return had gone off without a hitch: He would've inflicted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a> on the Crystal Ponies by magically brainwashing them into becoming his soldiers in a war against the rest of Equestria. As a confirmed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Sauron</a>, he can't even be mentioned without an aura of complete unpleasantness.
</li></ul></li><li> The Users (ie <em>people</em>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Reboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Reboot">Reboot</a></em> count from the perspective of those inside the computers. While they <em>do</em> send upgrades and keep the machine running it's purely for pragmatic reasons while they unleash game cubes which put the sprites and binomes in danger and program viruses. The only thing that stops this from going right into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a> territory is that the Users are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">Obliviously Evil</a>: they don't realize the denizens of the net are living sentient beings and play games for fun without realizing the danger and damage they cause.
</li><li> Flynn's one appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising">TRON: Uprising</a></em> is similar to the <em>Reboot</em> example. He's not malevolent, but he is a bit of an oblivious idiot who blows off the mounting Program-Iso tensions, Clu's power-hungry streak, and The Grid's problems with gridbugs and other stability issues. When System Guard Dyson appeals to Flynn for help in healing a nasty facial injury, Flynn is too distracted to help, leading Dyson to be one of the first (and most powerful) Programs to side with Clu in implementing the coup that left Flynn exiled and Tron grievously injured.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, Cupid is the God of Love (at least, according to him). He can be easily bribed to set a couple up, and if he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> to someone you don't want to be with, he won't care in the least.
</li><li> The nomadic Speakers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania2017">Castlevania (2017)</a></em> consider God (the abrahamic one) to be petty and cruel, pointing to the Tower of Babel as an example of His pettiness; Humanity's greatest accomplishment, a tower that would reach unto the heavens themselves, struck down by a jealous god who would not let His creations rival Him. She later clarifies that while the Speakers may abhor God, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool">nothing but reverence for the Christ, Yeshua</a>, who sacrificed himself for us so we could learn bottomless love and devotion.
