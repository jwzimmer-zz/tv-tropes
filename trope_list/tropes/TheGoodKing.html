<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has several examples:
<ul><li> King Nefertari Cobra cares deeply about his people. When a revolution takes place within his country, he's more concerned that his subjects are unhappy than he is about his own safety.
</li><li> King Neptune of Fishman Island, who used his own body to shield his subjects from an attack.
</li><li> Wapol's father was a king that cared for his subjects and was beloved by all. His son turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a>.
</li><li> Riku Dold III of Dressrosa is a really good king, who loves his country and subjects. Though his country was poor, it was thriving and the people loved him back. Then Doflamingo came and fucked everything up, making Riku Dold seem like a murderer who stole money from his citizens while slaughtering them via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a>. Once the truth was revealed, however, the Dressrosan people starting trusting Riku again.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Hotohori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>. He rules with fairness and he really is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>. It's just too bad he got chi-blasted by Nakago, because after that, the Konan Empire started falling apart, despite Houki and Boushin's best efforts.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>: Saber, Rider, and Archer were all considered great kings in their times. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>, they all hold themselves to vastly different standards. Saber isolated herself from her people and her emotions in order to be as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">effective and just as possible</a>. Rider was the opposite, his passionate love for his people allowing him to empathize with and inspire them. They both strongly disagree with each other's method of ruling; in particular, Saber believes that she wasn't isolated <em>enough</em> and wants to go back in time and never become king so that someone else could do a better job. And of course, Archer is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">giant asshole</a> who was nonetheless "good" due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings">Divine Right of Kings</a>.
</li><li> The King of the World from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> is a minor character, but is shown to be a kind and noble ruler (and later in the story, one of the few Earthlings to figure out that normal means will just get people killed against Cell.)
</li><li> Pharaoh Atem from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. In the anime and manga, he is intelligent, wise and noble, and has a deep love for his people and friends that leads him to sacrifice himself for them, maintaining a seal on the darkness until the protagonist accidentally releases his spirit at the series beginning. He is also a graduate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisePrince">wise prince</a>, as his father's sudden death and mistakes left him with a mess to sort out. His successor being sketchy is averted with Seto, who is said to have brought Egypt into a prosperous age.
</li><li> Toma E. Fiore from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> is the King of Fiore and considered a good king in spite of his limited screen time. While we haven't seen much of his governing skills, the fact that Fiore overall is a peaceful nation outside of the dark guilds lends credence to his ability, and he clearly shows concern for the people as his first order of business during the Grand Magic Games after learning about the upcoming dragon attack is to evacuate the citizens and plead the wizard guilds to help battle the oncoming enemy. He's also a very personable fellow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em>, the Raja is shown to be a good and benevolent ruler, beloved by his subjects.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn">Yona of the Dawn</a></em>: Yona's father was a good man, but a bit ineffective as a king. The land withered under his rule despite his best efforts, and the best that could be said about him was that he prevented war. Of course, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, this led to the nobles deriding him as a coward. His replacement, Soo-Won, is much more effective... but he earned the throne by murdering a man who saw him as a son, and encouraged his allies to act like common bandits against his own people to force them to acknowledge him.
</li><li> The King of Midland in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> looks to be this, but ends up being more of a deconstruction by the end. He is kind, honorable, intelligent, and has led his country through lifetimes of warfare, and in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>, he is willing to reward the Band of the Hawk irrespective of their common birth. As it turns out, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>—he's become so emotionally distant from his wife that she's cheating on him, he's under so much stress that it's heavily implied that his attempts to uplift Griffith are his plan to retire, and his love for his daughter has been badly warped to the point of lust. When things start going south, he snaps completely and spends the last few years of his life as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em>, we have Odin, king of the Aesir. Though he can be a bit imperious or cold, he means exceptionally well and has led his people through countless struggles—which is good, when he's one of the most powerful entities in the Marvel Universe.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a></em>, there's Highfather, ruler of New Genesis, a wise and kind leader who assumed the position after his wild youth and espouses a philosophy of freedom and pacifism. Notably, he tends to avoid acting as a king—he rules with a very light touch, and is more of a spiritual leader who serves to interpret the Source. This is to contrast with Darkseid, who rules with an iron fist.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em>:

He also fulfills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">Equal-Opportunity Evil</a> trope in fantasy by welcoming Wildlings and other outsiders into his Kingdom as equal subjects. Also many of the people who criticize Stannis and oppose him (Littlefinger, the Tyrells, Renly, the Lannisters, Varys) are shown to be very corrupt and self-serving. Robb Stark and Dany, both being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror">Young Conquerors</a>, have a hard time bluffing away their genuine inexperience and spend a lot of time trying to hide the fact that they are both in over their heads. No matter which persuasion they are, all of them have blood on their hands, have executed people and fought wars that have hurt innocents.
</li><li> In the backstory, among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Characters</a> who have sat on the Iron Throne, those remembered as good are Aegon I, Jaehaerys I, and Baelor the Blessed. Aegon I and Jaehaerys I are both remembered as the greatest Targaryen kings; one established the dynasty and its basic institutions, the other consolidated it and presided over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> by a series of diplomatic masterstrokes: he put the Faith on a leash, got rid of the right of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur">First Night</a>, brokered a truce between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a>, built roads, and developed a proper sewage system. Baelor the Blessed is considered a good king because of his religious piety which made him popular among the people, while the more educated nobility remember and regret his political mistakes and his propensity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning">Book Burning</a>; he was not a bad king, but he did make some bad decisions (to the point that Tyrion calls him Baelor the Befuddled) and is mostly remembered fondly because he was highly religious. Aegon V, Aegon the Unlikely, was remembered quite fondly as well, mostly thanks to the influence of his boyhood protector Ser Duncan and his attempts to provide rights to the smallfolk, but this, coupled with the actions of his children, made him unpopular with the nobility and on his death, his reforms were undone by the Hand of the King Tywin Lannister who became popular among the same nobility, but disliked by the smallfolk.
</li><li> The ultimate definition of a good king comes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero">Working-Class Hero</a> Davos Seaworth (who was raised to nobility by Stannis): <em>"There is much I do not understand, I have never pretended elsewise. I know the seas and rivers, the shapes of the coast, where the rocks and shoals lie. I know hidden coves where a boat can land unseen and I know a king protects his people or he is no king at all."</em> Stannis comes round to this way of thinking eventually.
</li><li> Historically there have been other examples. Garth VII "Goldenhand" Gardener is known as this in the Reach. He defeated many of the Reach's enemies, ruled for 81 years and brought three-quarters of a century of peace to the Reach, under which it truly flourished.
</li></ul></li><li> Carrot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> is an interesting version of this trope. Hes the lost-long heir to the Throne of Ankh-Morpork and an embodiment of all the fantastic kingly tropes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">While everyone knows or suspects that hes the rightful king</a>, he doesn't want the job - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">he's content with being a watchman</a> and he doesn't like that people tend to obey him because he's charismatic rather than because it's the right thing to do. Accordingly, he and Vetinari have an Understanding: Vetinari rules wisely, and so long as he does, Carrot keeps his head down (including destroying any evidence of his heritage), in return for the chance to occasionally make "suggestions". Since these are more or less exclusively for the good of the city (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfTheCity">which both are devoted to</a>), Vetinari doesn't mind.
<ul><li> King Verence II of Lancre is a benevolent and hard-working ruler who, unlike most of his predecessors, takes his job quite seriously. Although well enough regarded by his subjects (albeit with a form of fond condescension), Verence's attempts at modernizing his rustic backwater of a mountain kingdom go almost entirely unappreciated by the people of Lancre, who are unsophisticated but practical rural folk who are more concerned about getting up at 5:00 in the morning to milk the cows than attending parliament. He may not be the most confident ruler, or even successful, since his subjects don't really care about what he's doing for them, but gods know he's trying his best and people do appreciate that much about him.
</li><li> The current Low King of the Dwarfs, Rhys Rhysson, and Mr. Shine, the Diamond King of the Trolls. The two of whom work together to finally bring peace between their two peoples after centuries of enmity. Of course, with Rhys, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a> definitely applies - the position of Low King is an elected one, and dwarf politics can get very nasty. As Cheery puts it, any dwarf up for the Low Kingship is not going to be the sort who's spent their time caring for wounded animals and singing hi-ho all the time.

</li><li> Elros Half-Elven, the First King of Numenor, seems portrayed as a very good King. After ruling for 410 years he willingly gave up his life.

He and his wife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">Lady Galadriel</a>, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingCouple">Ruling Couple</a> have made Lothlórien a peaceful, safe and prosperous place to live for the local wood-elves for <em>millennia</em>.

As a grown man, he works toward reforming his country's laws to prevent abuse of power by his nobles. While he's a fairly good king, he's not necessarily a nice <em>person</em>, who can often be stuck-up, arrogant and commanding even to his closest friends. Lady Knight Keladry of Mindelan in particular is very critical of him. In response, he tells her about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommand">The Chains Of Command</a>.

He institutes religious freedom, lowers taxes, and punishes nobles who mistreat commoners. Whenever Aquilonia goes to war, Conan personally leads his troops into battle rather than having one of his generals do it. True to his barbarian upbringing he is also modest, preferring simple garments (though made of fine fabric) to ornate and garish clothing. Despite some hiccups early in his reign, his people and his armies love and aspire to be loyal to him (rallying to him without delay when he shows up despite seemingly being dead not long before), and one religious sect aids him when he is disposed in <em>The Hour of the Dragon</em> while stating that he will always be their king for what he did for them.

<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cersei notes to Margaery Tyrell, upon Tommen's coronation in Season 4's "First of His Name," that Tommen has the potential to be the first of these in <em>fifty years</em>. Joffrey was king for about three years, and Robert for about 17 (in the TV timeline). The Mad King ruled for over 20 years. She doesn't mention Aegon V by name, but she was apparently referring to him (Aegon V ruled for over 25 years, so there's no way she's talking about his father Maekar). Judging by Tommen's ideals of monarchy (holiness, justice, strength, and wisdom), she could well be right. Sadly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">now we know he won't</a>. His lack of experience prevents him from being effective in any of these areas. Tywin wastes no time convincing Tommen that true wisdom is recognizing when others know things you do not, which allows pretty much anyone to manipulate them. When the Faith Militant rises up again and imprisons Loras, Tommen is too indecisive and fearful to really take action against them. Then Margaery gets taken away as well and Tommen doesn't do anything. Then he further allows the Faith Militant to basically take over the crown and constantly change the laws of the Kingdom. While Joffrey was a terrible king because he subjected the kingdom to his cruel whims without concern for the consequences, Tommen is so indecisive that the kingdom is instead subject to the whims of everyone but himself. Ultimately, he throws himself out a window when Cersei finally moves against her enemies, that being quite literally the only power he possesses at that point.</span>
</li><li> Ned excels at two things: battle and administration. He is so loved by his bannermen and the smallfolk that his death at the hands of Southern rulers motivates them to <em>never again submit to the Iron Throne</em> and wage a civil war to avenge him.

</li><li> Mentioned in the novels, Emperor Kran, who was in charge at the time of the Earth-Centauri first contact. Inheriting a nation divided and on the verge of a civil war from his weak-willed predecessor, he reunited the Centauri Republic through sheer charisma and genius and was planning to initiate reforms to better the conditions of the poorer Centauri, even touring the poorer areas of the homeworld with the nobles in tow to show them the need for the reforms. Sadly, he was killed by a commoner during one of such tours before he could even start.

He even forms genuine friendships with his more powerful subjects, such as Kel'Thuzad and Anub'Arak. It's bitterly ironic that he's applying the very advice his father (whom he murdered) gave him about how to be a good king in his leadership of the Scourge.
<ul><li> According to the lore, King Llane Wrynn of Stormwind was one. His one flaw was that he was too trusting, resulting in Garona murdering him during a crucial time, resulting in Stormwind's fall during the First War. His son Varian eventually assumes the throne and appears to be this as well, although he is, at first, distrustful of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">worgen</a> of Gilneas. After Varian's death, his son Anduin returns to the throne (he was previously the King of Stormwind during Varian's disappearance). Hopefully, he will be like his father and grandfather. In Lordaeron, it's implied that King Terenas Menethil II was one as well. Unfortunately, his son Arthas ends up being corrupted by the Scourge and murdering him.

Many analysts consider this drastic reduction in popularity the real reason behind his unexpected abdication.
</li><li> King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the Fourth Dragon King of Bhutan, was the first king to lead his country out of isolation from the rest of the world, introduced modernization such as television and the internet, created the Gross National Happiness Index to rule based on what would make his subjects happy rather than just focusing on the economy, and finally abdicated and ordered parliamentary elections, on the basis that it had been found that countries with parliamentary democracies were happier than monarchies.

He saved Wessex from Viking Invasion after the Vikings had nearly conquered it. He then started a system of burghs to protect the country, and started an education system. His actions eventually united Britain. There's a reason he's the only English king to be given the moniker "the Great".
</li><li> Sultan Suleiman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent">The Magnificent</a> of the Ottoman Empire is fondly remembered by the Turks for his tolerance and fair rule, ushering in his reign a period of peace and stability later sultans would try to emulate.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PedroII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PedroII">Emperor Dom Pedro II</a> of Brazil. He was an abolitionist, a cultured man, and a sponsor of the arts and sciences, using his power in a benevolent way. He was also a massive advocate for the freedom of his people, with freedom of speech, civil rights, economic development, and democratic representation flourishing under his rule, and was willing to accept that the monarchy's days were numbered and that Brazil's future would best be served by a transition into a republic.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03746');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03746" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03746');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Admittedly, the <em>reason</em> for this sentiment was due more to sexism than anything  the only issue he had was a daughter, Maria, and Pedro did not believe she was capable of ruling his vast empire, nor did he think anyone in his government would support her. The other reason was that he was unwilling to shed blood to fight back against the eventual republican coup, even though he clearly had the support of the people. (Bizarrely, even the coup plotters greatly admired him, to the point where they <em>seriously regretted</em> launching the coup in the first place after he actually abdicated.)</span> He is still a national hero and highly respected in Brazil to this day.
</li><li> Christian IV of Denmark is, despite his horrible war record that later almost destroyed the country, universally respected as a great ruler. He loved art and music and budgeted many musicians to play at his court, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>, was a very upbeat man even in his elderly days, ruled justly and was a joy to be around.

The last Austro-Hungarian Emperor, Karl/Karoly IV in particular's still highly regarded for his humility, efforts to end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the Great War</a> and dedication to serve (and hold intact) the Empire...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">which went horribly wrong</a>. If anything, his reign is something of a tragic deconstruction similar to Brazil's Emperor Dom Pedro above: his work to alleviate the sufferings of his people, holding the various realms together and generally being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> among the Central Powers would have helped the Habsburg monarchy endure into the 20th century and beyond if not for the strains of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> ultimately tearing the Empire at the seams.

He was kind to his subjects, religiously tolerant in an era of fanaticism and religious war, devoted to ensuring national prosperity (the phrase "a chicken in every pot" as shorthand for "everyone doing well economically" is derived from his statement that, God willing, he would ensure that every peasant in France would have "a chicken in his pot every Sunday") and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">a famously good time</a>.
</li><li> Emperor Trajan, the second of the "Five Good Emperors of Rome." He extended Rome to the pinnacle of its size and power, but what really makes him this trope is that his reputation has survived, unblemished, through <em>nineteen centuries</em> of scholarship, making him one of the most triumphant aversions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> that sometimes comes with naming historical figures as this trope. It was customary afterward for the Senate to pray when recognizing a new emperor that he be as good as Trajan.

</li><li> Umberto II, last king of Italy, managed to prove himself this both as Lieutenant General for the Realm (basically, his father Vittorio Emanuele III made him regent after Italy switched sides in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> because he himself was tainted by having supported the Fascist regime while Umberto was a known opposer of both Fascism and Nazism), when he managed to avoid the secession of Sicily without spilling a single drop of blood, and in his brief reign (35 days) where, in the face of the many irregularities in the referendum that had seen the Italians choosing the republican regime, he single-handedly defused any chance of a civil war while <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling out the government for proclaiming the Republic before the official results were announced</a>.

He created the Korean alphabet '<a class="urllink" href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/korean.htm">Hangul<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>' from scratch for peasants who couldn't learn complex Chinese characters. He helped create the traditional Korean music notes with his own music skills. He began a series of military conquests to ensure that neighboring countries would respect their border. He let a genius commoner work in his court and develop automatic water clocks, sundials, and the world's first rain gauge. He published books about agriculture that would help peasants, researched and legislated laws that were so groundbreaking at that time that later kings didn't find the need to legislate new ones for <em>centuries</em>, and set a precedent for future kings by trying to debate and cooperate with his subjects, not rule over them. This overworking combined with diabetes probably caused his death at age 52. Koreans are so grateful to him that even centuries after his death, they use his portrait on their money, named the main road that crosses downtown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul">Seoul</a> after him, built a statue of him in the middle of said road, and named the administrative city after him.

When his army lost the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HundredYearsWar">battle of Poitiers (a.k.a. Maupertuis)</a>, he refused to retreat, ended up in English hands, and had to be ransomed for three million gold écus and several French provinces (the biggest king's ransom in French history). He also gave his younger son Philip the Bold the duchy of Burgundy, without which there might not have been the internecine strife between the Armagnacs and Bourgignons and the English-Burgundian alliance that disastrously affected the reign of John's grandson, King Charles VI. No wonder there never was another King John of France...
</li><li> King Casimir III the Great of Poland. He rebuilt Poland financially, doubled the size of the kingdom, founded the first Polish university, gave Jews rights and protections as 'people of the king', encouraged Jewish migration and reformed the law. He was sometimes called 'the Peasant King' because he was known for taking the side of commoners where the law didn't protect them from the nobility and clergy, or 'the Polish Justinian', for his reforms of judiciary system and work for unified legal code. A popular Polish proverb says he 'found Poland wooden and left brick', due to his support for urbanization (with over 100 towns founded during his reign) and fortification of the country.

Sweden fondly remembers him from freeing them from the yoke of King Christian II Of Denmark (who to this day is referred to as "Kristian Tyrann" or [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Christian The Tyrant</a> in Sweden), and is widely recognized as the father of modern Sweden, to the point that the Swedish Day Of Independence on June 6th is one of two commemorative events (the other being the signing of the 1809 government declaration) because that's the day when Gustav Vasa was officially crowned king in 1523, leading to the official dissolution of the Kalmar Union. However, for all of his accomplishments, Vasa is remembered for his vicious destruction of the catholic church, and introducing Protenstatism as the official religion of Sweden mainly so he could confiscare the Church's wealth. This, combined with his taxation policy, resulted in the "Dackefejden" (Dacke Feud), a peasant uprising in southern Sweden led by revolutionary Nils Dacke that took years to put down. Regardless, despite the controversy in his own time, King Vasa is still a beloved icon in Sweden and considered a national hero into modern day.

Unlike the aforementioned examples, Olav was a constitutional monarch and had no <em>actual</em> power, but was extremely well-regarded in Norway as a symbol of national unity, to the degree that he was voted "Norwegian of the Century" in 2005 (fifteen years after his death) despite being born Danish.

He lives in Germany, where he runs a car service station. He manages most of the governing via Skype, but he regularly visits his people. He has raised several fundraisers to improve the standard of living for his people (often even paid much of the costs himself). Among other things, he has built water pumps and pipes, schools, hospitals, training centres and even prisons.
