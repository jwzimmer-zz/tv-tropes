Even so, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's heavily implied he knows many mysteries about the Titans, and is the one who gave Eren his Titan Shifting powers, via a mysterious injection.

</li><li> Perhaps even more so is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren Kruger</span>, who only appears in the flashbacks of the character mentioned above, but is essentially responsible for all the events in the series turning out the way they did — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grisha met Kruger when he was a child and was present on the day Grisha's sister was killed. He's the reason why Grisha joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> and met his first wife Dina and it's because of him that Zeke Yeager, the Beast Titan, was born.

You can say that she's the whole reason why Tomobiki starts to fight for his (somewhat pathetic) life.

Without Hikaru helping, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ichiro Suzuki</a> is forced to do a programming "Death March" of 80+ work weeks to meet a deadline to finish a game. When he finishes and falls asleep, the next he knows is that he has been returned to his 15-year-old body and sent to the fantasy world where the entire story takes place.

Kyojuro's death is also the first one Inosuke reacts with proper sorrow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>:
<ul><li> IceDevimon was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> who kidnapped Rika with the intent of making her his Tamer. While he was destroyed at the end of his episode, Rika's encounter with him was so traumatizing that she declared her hatred of all Digimon including her own partner Renamon. She and Renamon wouldn't reunite until an episode later which was the beginning of a massive change in Rika's attitude towards Renamon and Digimon as a whole.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternZodiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternZodiac">The Horse Deva</a>, Indramon, only appeared in two episodes, the second of which was his death. However, his vicious beatdown on Impmon set in motion the events that led to Impmon making a deal with the Devas to become Beezlemon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Grandpa Gohan is dead by the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s beginning and only appears in person during the Fortuneteller Baba Saga, but it was his finding Goku and raising him that turned Goku from the future destroyer of humanity to the altruistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> we know and love. Furthermore, Goku's first born son is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">named in his honor</a>.
</li><li> Believe it or not, Raditz is essentially the catalyst for the entire second half of the <em>Dragon Ball</em> manga (or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, as it's usually named). Had Raditz not remembered his little brother and come to Earth, the entire series would have been turned on its head: Piccolo and Goku would never have teamed up and thus Piccolo wouldn't have joined the Z-Fighters. He may have even remained evil, and continued on with a plan to terrorize planet Earth, had he and Goku not joined forces. Goku wouldn't have trained with King Kai, but merely at his own pace, and would have been far too weak to combat the androids by the time they arrived, assuming he hadn't already died from the heart virus he was to contract. Gohan would never have been trained by Piccolo, and thus would never have become a fighter at all. Vegeta and Nappa would never have received the transmission involving the Dragon Balls, and thus would never have visited the Earth, thus remaining under Freeza's thumb  Freeza himself would also never have been killed, allowing the Cold family to continue terrorizing the universe. And who knows what trouble Babidi would've caused if he'd arrived earlier and unleashed Buu unchallenged. Despite being the weakest villain at the start of the series, Raditz coming to Earth is what allowed the Z series to be what it became.
</li><li> Dr. Gero. He's long dead in Trunks' timeline and is only around for a few episodes as Android 20 before being killed by Android 17. However, it is Gero who created all the androids, including Cell, and his actions turns two timelines into a living hell and nearly destroys the solar system of the main timeline. Literally <em>everything</em> bad that happens in the Android/Cell Saga is his fault.
<ul><li> And then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a>,</em> even though Gero's creations aren't actually involved, the entire Future Trunks saga where Goku Black and Zamasu wreak havoc on the future timeline was caused because Bulma invented time travel to undo the damage left behind by the Cyborgs/Androids. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And on the bright side, Dr. Gero also indirectly <em>saved the multiverse</em> by creating Androids 17 and 18, who were key players in the Universe Survival tournament, with the former ending up the ultimate victor and passing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> behind the tournament by wishing for the others' return.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Bibidi is long dead by the time the Buu saga begins, but he's the one who instigated it by summoning Majin Buu in the first place. And while his 'son'/doppelganger Babidi is continuing the plan in his place, Babidi doesn't have all of Bibidi's knowledge, and so doesn't know the spell that actually <em>unseals</em> Buu, forcing him to steal energy to do it. Babidi is also verbally abusive to Buu and controls him through the threat of being sealed away, unlike Bibidi who preferred to use cake as a reward, which got him killed when Buu finally made it clear that he didn't appreciate the poor treatment.
</li><li> Van Zant, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> gunman who shot Mr. Satan and Bee, triggers the latter half of the Buu Saga. He only appears in two episodes, but his attack on Mr. Satan and Bee, whom Majin Buu had befriended, directly results in the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Evil Buu</a>, who in turn eats his good half and becomes Super Buu.
</li><li> The Yardrat race barely appears in the anime and not at all in the manga, but them teaching Goku Instant Transmission off-screen ends up saving the earth several times over.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Dragon Ball Minus</a></em>, Bardock and Gine. They were the ones to send Goku to Earth. If they hadn't, Goku would have died along with their planet. And without Goku, Pilaf would've become ruler of earth thanks to the Dragon Balls.
</li><li> Lord Zuno, the smartest being in the universe; despite him showing up for only two scenes in the Future Trunks Saga, it's him telling Zamasu about the Super Dragon Balls and Goku that gives Zamasu the information needed to begin his plans, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> first by killing his master to become a Supreme Kai and taking the Time Ring, using it to go a year into the future, and making a wish on the Super Dragon Balls to take Goku's body, creating Goku Black</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, the three muggers who try to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rob Goku unknowingly cause the Universe Survival arc.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tomoo appears in one episode and one manga chapter, but it was his actions that ultimately played the biggest role in turning Lucy into a bitter figure who hated humanity (namely he beat her puppy to death with a rock/vase and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">made Lucy watch when he did</a>). Lucy snapped and brutally executed him and his cronies, as well as someone who may or may not have meant to betray her. It was all downhill from there.
</li><li> Speaking of someone who may or may not have meant to betray Lucy, the unnamed "orphanage girl" also has a small role, but has just as big an impact on the plot as Tomoo: the reason Tomoo found out that Lucy even had a puppy was because the orphanage girl told him about it, even though the orphanage girl had previously promised Lucy to keep the puppy's existence a secret. So while Tomoo's murder of a puppy sent Lucy down the path of misanthropy, it was the unnamed orphanage girl who made Tomoo's actions possible. The girl later claims that she blabbed about the puppy by accident, but Lucy thinks the girl betrayed her on purpose out of malice. It's left ambiguous which interpretation is correct.
</li><li> Aiko Takada has an equally brief appearance, but she's Lucy's second human friend, and it was her death that resulted in Lucy being captured and imprisoned in the Diclonius Research Institute, as well as the catalyst for Lucy's long-running vendetta with Kurama.
</li><li> Diclonius Silpleit # 3 died quickly in a flashback, but not before infecting Kurama and his original assistant with the virus that caused their children to be born Diclonius. This led to Mariko's birth, the realization of the manner of Diclonius propagation, and down the line, the existence of Lucy.

However, had they not asked the Soothsayer to predict their son's future, the events of the trilogy would have been very different. Indeed, because of this prophecy, Shen tried to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> exterminate all pandas</span>, which ultimately resulted in Po being found and adopted by Mr. Ping and growing up near the Jade Palace, becoming the Dragon Warrior years later.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em>, Lord Farquaad only appears in a handful of scenes and has little interaction with the main characters. However, his sending of the fairy tale creatures to Shrek's swamp caused Shrek to intervene and be sent by Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona so Farquaad could marry her and officially call himself king of Duloc. Fiona then falls in love with Shrek and marries him, thus foiling the plans of every subsequent villain and changing the fates of both Duloc and Far Far Away.

The only POV character she interacts with is Daenerys. However, her actions become not only the driving force behind much of Daenerys's story arc, but also the reason that dragons (and in turn, stronger magic), have returned to the world.

</li><li> Lyanna Stark only appears as a statue and in the memories of Ned Stark, but she had one of the largest influences in the plot: her kidnapping led to the death of Ned's father and brother and Robert's Rebellion, her death turned Robert Baratheon into a depressed man whose disdain for ruling caused no short end to problems <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she might be mother to Jon Snow, a character whose role in the books has been incredibly important.</span>

He's a minor character in the novel (and in the film he's on screen for only fifteen minutes or so), and yet he drives the plot forward on several occasions all by himself. (Amusingly, Anthony Hopkins set a record by winning the Best Actor Oscar in the shortest amount of screen time.)
<ul><li> This is even more the case in the preceding novel, <em>Red Dragon.</em> Unlike his relationship with Clarice, which formed the real meat of <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, his relationship with Will Graham is mostly restricted to a mutual hatred.

</li><li> Narcissa Malfoy in the latter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books. In terms of facetime and notoriety, she takes backseat to her husband and son and mostly just another snobby wizard supremacist. However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">the sixth book</a>, her binding Snape to the Unbreakable vow is ultimately responsible for the climax of the story.

</li><li> Lucius Malfoys role in the story also by far eclipses his actual screen (err page) time. Dumbledore had suspected all along that Voldemort had made horcruxes at some point but didnt: have any proof, know how many there could be, know what kind of objects theyd be, and have a time frame. When Lucius slips Ginny the diary horcrux in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">second book</a>, he puts into motion the events of the rest of the series. Dumbledore was able to work backwards and figure out everything he didnt know (that hed made them in his young adult years, they were objects based around the Hogwarts founders, and since hes not deaf that there were more) to ultimately take him down. When Ginny uses the diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, it also let them get basilisk venom which is one of the few things that can destroy horcuxes.
</li><li> Kreacher. When screenwriter Michael Goldenberg tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">adapt him out</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J.

(Goldenberg can be forgiven for attempting it, since Kreacher's <em>one</em> plot-critical moment had, at the time, not yet been published.)
</li><li> The sixth book introduces many characters who appear only via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback">Pensieve Flashback</a>, most — if not all — of whom are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">long gone by the time the series start</a>: Marvolo, Morfin, and Merope Gaunt; Bob Ogden; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tom Riddle, Sr.</span>; Mrs. Cole; and Hepzibah Smith and her House Elf, Hokey. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They're all connected to Voldemort's backstory: Marvolo, Morfin, Merope, and Riddle Sr. are Voldemort's maternal grandfather, uncle, mother, and father, respectively; Ogden's encounter with them eventually led to Voldemort's birth at the orphanage Mrs. Cole would be running by the time Dumbledore went there, and Voldemort met Hepzibah Smith and Hokey when he was employed to liaise with Hepzibah for her antique collections, two of which eventually fell into Voldemort's hands.</span>
</li><li> Dumbledore's siblings, Aberforth &amp; Ariana, don't show up until very late in the series (Aberforth is mentioned in passing a few times and shows up about three quarters through <em>Deathly Hallows</em> but Ariana goes completely unmentioned until the beginning of that book) but are very important to his backstory and the story in general. To make a long story short, some Muggle boys did something horrible to Ariana when they saw her doing magic when she was a kid. It's implied but not outright stated to have been some sort of sexual abuse and their dad went to prison for attacking them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a>. The trauma caused Ariana to repress her magic and become unstable. She accidentally killed their mom. Dumbledore got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">Promotion to Parent</a> and didn't take it well because he wanted to go see the world but he wanted Aberforth to finish school and so he stayed. Gellert Grindelwald came knocking on their village and Albus wanted to go on his trip with him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> and take Ariana with them. Aberforth put his foot down and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">Mêlée à Trois</a> ensued with poor Ariana caught in the middle, she got killed even though they don't know who actually killed her. Her death made Albus realize that power went to his head and explains why the greatest wizard of his age became a teacher instead of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>. He still hates himself for it, so much that the only time he ever actually mentions her is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></em> while trying to empathize with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leta Lestrange</span> who similarly still hates herself for incidentally causing her younger siblings death as a kid. Aberforth also feels incredibly guilty for it and its why the brothers arent necessarily close as adults. She's been dead for about a hundred years by the time of his death but wanting to see her to apologize to her in the Resurrection Stone is how he gets the curse that kills him. It's also clear on a re-read that Aberforth uses his role as the barkeeper at the Hog's Head to spy on Death Eaters for his brother. In fact, he's the one who kicked Snape out of the bar halfway through the prophecy, setting in motion the event that cause Harry's parents' death and in turn Snape turning spy against Voldemort,

Fans of the show, however, know that she only ever appeared in seven episodes, almost never for more than one scene, and she only ever made two "shocking returns" (and it was never a surprise for any of the heroes — none of them met her or knew who she was until her last arc in Season 4 — only for the audience). Still, she did make <em>quite</em> a splash whenever she did show up, most notably in the Season 2 finale, where in her one minute of screentime she managed to single-handedly turn the upbeat, triumphant ending into a horribly uncertain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>.

This didn't result in anything huge at first, as Batista became a "Deacon" and one of Keibler's allies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">The Dudley Boys</a> faction, while Orton was injured soon after his debut and had his career sidelined for the rest of the year. But in early 2003, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> introduced both of these men as the junior members of their new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a> stable. Batista and Orton proved quite useful to HHH, to say the least: they helped him retain his World Heavyweight Championship for far longer than he deserved, and against the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott Steiner</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>. They also played a crucial role in causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> to lose the match whose stipulation was that he would have to unmask, costing Kane what last shreds of his sanity remained so that he turned against his brother and former ally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> and buried him alive — causing 'Taker to be resurrected as his "Deadman" persona once again in 2004 after having been a biker character for the past four years. And of course, Evolution would set the stage for the titanic power struggle between HHH and Orton, which started in 2004 and continued off and on for nearly five whole years after that! (The two wouldn't bury the hatchet permanently until 2013, when they joined forces as members of The Authority.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox">Alicia Fox</a> killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> in 2008. Well, indirectly, and only temporarily. It was the videotape of her being romanced by the Rated-R Superstar on the day of his wedding to then-General Manager of <em>SmackDown</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a> (leaked by Triple H during the ceremony) that caused Vickie to turn vindictively on her fiancé and rehire the Undertaker (who had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">permanently banished from WWE about a month earlier</a>), whom she then pitted against Edge in a main event <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell">Hell in a Cell</a> Match at that year's <em>SummerSlam</em>. In that match, the Undertaker chokeslammed Edge right through the ring that created a hole, and then caused flames to erupt from it, the implication being that Edge had literally been sent to Hell. But bringing 'Taker back was the worst possible thing that Vickie could have done, since the "Deadman" turned his wrath on her as well as Edge (he having much more reason to hate <em>her</em>, after all). His attempt to choke Vickie's soul out of her body resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> turning heel to save her, which, in turn, resulted in Big Show becoming Vickie's new boyfriend, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Edge returned</a>. This sparked a bitter feud between Undertaker and Big Show that lasted for the rest of the year and continued into 2009 before Vickie and Edge got back together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a> has perhaps exerted the greatest direct influence on WWE of any Diva in history: <br/>An inadvertent blow to the neck from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> nearly crippled her, turned boyfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a> into an overprotective and possessive jerk, and ultimately caused Bryan to lash out at Lee for nearly everything she did, including his losing the World Heavyweight Championship in 18 seconds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em>, thus leading Bryan to virulently dump AJ on the following week's episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a></em>. Daniel's cruelty apparently caused AJ's mind to snap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">resulting in her behavior becoming ever more erratic</a> and her profile on television to rise, as airtime was steadily eaten up by her bizarre antics. Indeed, AJ was transformed into such an outrageous scene stealer that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> appointed her as General Manager of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWE Raw</a></em> later that summer  much to the chagrin of Daniel Bryan, who had assumed that she had agreed to marry him in the ring when in fact she had accepted the GM position. <br/>This cruel prank, in turn, caused Bryan to lose his mind, which in turn led to him having to seek psychological group therapy along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>... which culminated in the two of them forming a comedic tag team called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeamHellNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeamHellNo">Team Hell No</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turned both characters face again</a>. This marked the beginning of Daniel Bryan's true rocket to stardom in WWE, making him so popular that not only did he go on to win the WWE Championship three times, but when he was respectively excluded from and (relatively) quickly eliminated in the 2014 and 2015 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> matches, fan disillusionment ran so deep that the WWE Universe turned virulently on the men who did win those matches: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>. While Batista turned this situation into heel heat for what eventually led to Bryan's title win at <em>WrestleMania 30</em>, Reigns never regained the adoration he had during his days with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">is still heavily booed despite being a face</a>, and has had to acknowledge that fact within kayfabe. <br/>Also affected by AJ-mania? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>, whose popularity was heavily propelled by AJ becoming his manager in December of 2012, leading him to his first true World Heavyweight Championship reign. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay">The New Day</a>, an enormously popular trio that might have not existed if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston">Big E Langston</a> was never given the role he got in the Ziggler/Lee faction. Not to mention, the breakup and solo success of the members of The Shield, as without the formation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a> and the return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a>, which can respectively be attributed to Bryan's rise to popularity and the outcry over Batista winning the Rumble (which as previously mentioned was largely because of Bryans absence from the match), their arc would not have played out the same.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a>'s actions as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackdown">Smackdown Live!</a></em>'s General Manager played a huge role in the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">"The Man"</a>. She booked a Triple Threat match where the champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella">Carmella</a> would face Becky and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Summerslam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Summerslam">Summerslam</a> 2018</em>. At the end of said match, with Charlotte stealing the victory and the championship from her hands at the last minutes of the match, and feeling that everything she worked for has been stolen again, Becky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned heel</a> on Charlotte, and their friendship was destroyed. This, in turn, would lead to the revamp of Becky as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>-like character (with the audience <em>refusing</em> to boo her), a series of well-received matches against Charlotte (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWrestlingObserverNewsletter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWrestlingObserverNewsletter">four-and-three-quarter-star-rated</a> Last Man Standing match at <em>WWE Evolution</em>), the Twitter feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>, Becky being injured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax">Nia Jax</a> in the <em>Raw</em> go-home episode for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a> 2018</em> (and the resulting injury from Nia's botch making Becky look like a warrior), Becky being left out of <em>SS</em> due to said injury, and the main event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 35</em> being changed from Ronda vs. Charlotte into a Triple Threat match with Becky inserted as a challenger between the two champions in a "Winner Takes All" match... which she won, resulting in Becky being the first Women's Champion holding both the Raw and Smackdown Women's titles at the same time and becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">the new face</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENewEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENewEra">the WWE's "New Era"</a>. Oh, and if that wasn't enough, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, her new persona being called "The Man" led to a series of Twitter quips with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>, who also called himself "The Man"... and who eventually not only would become his boyfriend, but also the father of her child.
</li></ul></li><li> The Big Show heel turn mentioned above had another bit player besides Alicia Fox. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick">Brian Kendrick</a> won a match to qualify for a WWE championship shot against Triple H. Big Show thought he won, so he stepped out of the ring over the top rope and walked back to the locker room. Little did he know Kendrick was being hoisted on his bodyguard Ezekiel Jacksons shoulders. After Show left ringside, Kendrick was rolled back into the ring to claim victory. Frustration over this loss ultimately may have caused Show to snap that fateful night.

A year later this strange chain of events led to the creation of <em>All In</em>, the biggest indie PPV, and half a year later, it ended up in the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a>, the first serious competitor to the WWE ever since the end of WCW.
</li><li> Despite his run with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a> lasting less than a year before he left NJPW for WWE, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt">Fergal Devitt</a> (WWE's Finn Bálor) influence on the course of the stable's and the company's history can be felt nearly five years following his departure. The foundation he created for Bullet Club with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq">The Kliq</a>-style covenant motif enabled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> to seamlessly step into the front seat the same night he departed and complete the dream of BC winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on its official one-year anniversary. The camaraderie, cool T-shirt, and general badass antics of the Club, all of which were established by Devitt and his friends, combined with the high-profile presence of Styles in his stead, made them a worldwide phenomenon so powerful that taking the name of Bullet Club as a cash cow became a central part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a>' "world-changing" agenda when it was time for Styles and The Good Brothers to leave; and even after The Elite's antics became too much to be sustainable within the group's core values, rather than dying out or letting them fully absorb the title of Bullet Club, the core members he started with were able to band together and hatch a successful plan to take The Club back. Oh, and the Elite being ousted from the stable (and later the promotion, though this was because the Elite decided to let their contracts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> amd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> run out and not re-sign) <em>also</em> led to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a>. So yeah, a WWE superstar created the stable that would, in turn, create the first serious rival for the WWE ever since the folding of WCW.
<ul><li> The biggest seed of Devitt's influence, however, would come where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayWhite">Jay White</a>, the young man who tagged with Devitt once in the United Kingdom and impressed him so much that The Prince got Jay in touch with Bad Luck Fale to bring him into NJPW, would step forward and take his place at the front of Bullet Club as the culmination of both the BCOG/Firing Squad scheme and White's personal mission to sabotage rival faction CHAOS. White would then bring the same IWGP Heavyweight Championship back to Bullet Club in short order, winning it from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> just over a month after Tanahashi claimed the title from a departing Omega, validating his ascent as The Club's true weapon of choice to succeed Devitt after Styles. And Devitt responded by Tweeting his name and wearing the same color ring gear as him. This has only strengthened with the addition of KENTA at the end of the 2019 G1 tour.

But as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> pointed out succinctly in his analysis of the play, without Tybalt, the rest of the play's events would never have happened.
<ul><li> Remember that there was more than one friar? Of course not, because Friar John is in one scene and has about five lines. But because he fails to deliver a letter to Romeo, the tragedy of the climax is allowed to unfold.

Whether she's seen as a "good" or "bad" character is a key decision when staging the play, and directors tend to give her plenty of extra stage time to pray in Hebrew or look tragic. Lorenzo could also be seen this way—besides being the boy who steals Jessica, he has one of the play's best soliloquies ("How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank...")
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMagicFlute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMagicFlute">The Magic Flute</a></em>, the Queen of the Night only appears in three scenes (and the opera counts them in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurActsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurActsAreDifferent">French scenes</a>" way). Two of them consist entirely of an extravagant coloratura aria (and many people only remember the second one). The third is a small part of the second act finale in which she gets in only a few lines before her final defeat.

The letter reveals that Fantine has an illegitimate daughter, which in turn gets her fired, which in turn forces her into prostitution, which in turn prompts Valjean to pity her, which in turn makes him on the scene to save a man from a runaway cart, which in turn makes Inspector Javert reveal that a man he thinks is Valjean has been arrested, which in turn makes Valjean decide to turn himself in <em>and</em> promise to care for the dying Fantine's daughter, which in turn...you know what, it's probably easier to simply say that the Nameless Factory Worker is the most important character in the show.
<ul><li> Then there's the Bishop, who sets Valjean on a path of righteousness for the entirety of the play. Without him Valjean would likely have continued his self-destructive spiral until rejailed or killed, Fantine would have been arrested and died in prison, Cosette would have stayed with the Thenardiers, causing her to never meet Marius, who would more zealously assist the revolutionaries and die among them. Curiously, Eponine <em>might</em> have survived the show, not ever reaching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> caused by Marius and Cosette's relationship.

The team? Juggernauts. Their leader? Gorge, Malcolm's longest-standing rival, and the one who would eventually dethrone him.

</li><li> In her self-titled episode, she tells Steven that, on Rose's request, she designed her sword so that it could only poof a Gem, never shatter. This is what makes him suspicious when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blue Diamond yells at his trial that Rose used a sword to shatter Pink Diamond, and more so when the below-mentioned Defence Zircon points out other holes in the story.

<ul><li> His first appearance in season 2's <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Kills</em> has him rebuild the Monarch's organization and reunites him with Dr. Girlfriend. These events lead up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their marriage at the end of season 2</span> and their evil-doing abilities have gone up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">a few levels</a> ever since.
</li><li> His second major appearance in season 3's <em>The Doctor is Sin</em> has him attempt to do the same thing for Doctor Venture and Venture Industries, but ultimately serves to give Venture a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a></span>.

</li><li> His third appearance in the pre-Season 6 one-hour special <em>All This and Gargantua-2</em>, has him helping to build up and expand the Revenge Society into a legitimate super villain organization. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He also kills the Investors and saves the Guild of Calamitous Intent after the Sovereign tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>.</span> It's a major shakeup in the Venture universe, to be sure.
