All you know is what he's doing right this minute is kind of endearing from an audience perspective. He's fun, he's cool. Quirky, maybe, but in a good way. At this rate, he'll be a runaway favourite with the fans. Yeah, he's okay. We like him. He's...
</p><p>Wait, what is he doing now? Why has he cornered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeyTheWonderDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeyTheWonderDog">Tropey</a> in the old mill? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements">What's with the bicycle pump, oven mitts and three pounds of feathers?</a> ...oh.

</p><p>Did the cunning writers set you up to sort of like the villain just so it would be even more jarring when you realized he was, well, <em>evil</em>? That's this trope.

Kind of a bait-and-switch technique for viewer sympathy. Distinct from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> because the character was always this much of a psycho, but the audience just hadn't seen it yet, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">they may have heard</a> that they did something bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy">offscreen</a>. It's generally always done purely to accentuate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment—you see a bit of personal quirkiness or interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> that has you liking this character, that has you 'on their side', and then they do something really really nasty, and as a viewer you feel worse because you're guilty by association.

A Bait the Dog moment can subvert an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>, or it might show that the character is more complex than first appears. Often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>, ironically, or perhaps fittingly enough.

</p><p>This is ultimately a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalTropes">Betrayal Trope</a> (of audience expectations if not other characters in-universe), so there will be spoilers.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Griffith in the Golden Age Arc is a charismatic mercenary captain who comes across as the most cool, likable, and admirable person you've ever met, especially as seen through the eyes of the protagonist Guts, so that it really hits you for a curveball when you're occasionally reminded how ruthless and scary he can be. He's a brilliant battlefield commander and swordfighter, he makes Guts feel right at home with the Hawks in no time, he risks his life to save Guts twice, all of his followers practically worship him, and he's a hit with the ladies including Princess Charlotte whom he woos in a courtly manner. Then he asks Guts to assassinate Count Julius, the King's brother who had just made a failed attempt on Griffith's life, in which Guts also accidentally kills Julius' young son Adonis. When Griffith hears the news from Charlotte's maid Anna, he briefly flashes a wicked grin, indicating that he isn't bothered by a child's innocent blood on his hands, that he assassinated Charlotte's uncle or the fact that he used Guts for such a dirty mission — in fact, it is speculated by Judeau that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">he may have actually wanted the boy dead along with Julius because he was being groomed to marry Charlotte, who Griffith wanted for himself</a>. The way he deals with the Queen's conspiracy against him is similarly chilling, as he uses Minister Foss' daughter as a hostage to make him betray the conspirators, kills the Queen and her plotters by trapping them in a burning building, and then has Guts kill the men he hired to kidnap Foss' daughter so the evidence won't lead back to him.
<ul><li> The scary thing is that Griffith goes for another round in this. Take all these and you may still think he's just a hopeless dreamer in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> that is Midland. He might be viewed as a brilliant and charismatic figure with shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>, but overall still comes off pretty antiheroic and can earn respect. You might even have sympathy for him after he is tortured and reduced to a broken shell of his former self by a vengeful King who wants him dead. But then comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">the Eclipse</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">and a betrayal of every one of his followers that is so utterly horrifying that any kind of respect from the audience is probably gone</a>. <em>Especially</em> with what he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">does to Guts</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">and Casca</a> upon becoming Femto.
</li></ul></li><li> Bishop Mozgus is a fanatical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> inquisitor who is infamous for having no reason or mercy in his hunt for heretics, and the scary thing is he's really convinced that he's torturing and executing people in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulsavingCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulsavingCrusader">save their souls</a>. One time when his subordinate Farnese catches a bunch of starving refugees attacking a supply cart, he takes pity on a woman with a starving baby and promises to get more aid for the refugees. His reassuring fatherly concern makes it seem for a moment like maybe he has a compassionate side to him after all, but then he shows just how sick his sense of justice is when he escorts her into the torture chamber (by far <em>the</em> most nightmarish place in the entire Tower of Conviction) and tells her she still needs to pay for her blasphemy, even if she spoke it for the sake of her child. Afterward, Farnese finds the woman back among the refugees having lost her mind from the torture and carrying her dead baby in her arms.

<ul><li> Technically, the episode <em>before</em> the wedding incident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">already established her as a psychopath.</a> The next episode just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">hammered it home.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Johan Liebert of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> indulges in this trope on more than one occasion. He's hardly ever shown as anything other than an awful psychopath who enjoys murdering people for little more than shits and giggles. However, during the university arc, we see him lovingly playing with children, and helping an old man and his illegitimate son reunite for the first time. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this is quickly subverted when we see that he manipulated said children into playing a game by which they would attempt to balance themselves on the sides of rooftops, whereby many children fell to their deaths, and that he merely brought the father and son together so that it would be easier to kill them both (he fails on the second part, but still).</span> He also gives money to a sickly homeless woman... because he can tell she's a heroin addict, and would almost certainly spend the money to buy more.
</li><li> Speaking of monsters, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em> has Shira pulling a <em>literal</em> dog bait as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>: Rin is feeling uncertain about whether she's strong enough to go through with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a> quest, so Shira treats her to some wild boar and tells her that he became a strong swordsman by killing humans, that their deaths became the strength that allowed him to survive, and that the wild boar they're eating is no different: Its death is now allowing him and Rin to grow strong and survive. And then, just as Rin eases into the fact that she'll have to get over the fact that she's out on a quest to kill someone and has to become more like Shira, he reveals that the meat she just ate wasn't wild boar after all but <em>her pet dog</em>... Why did he do it? Because he <em>likes</em> messing with people's heads; he does it routinely whenever he interacts with confused or uncertain characters and, considering the fact that it's <em>far</em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">the worst thing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Shira</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist">likes doing</a>, it's kind of amazing how often he can fool even readers into thinking that he might have a decent bone in his body... The quite possibly only reason this works so well is because <em>Blade of the Immortal</em> runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>, with even the worst villains having redeeming qualities, making Shira's pure evil very unexpected and out-of-place.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, this is a key part of the intro for Caster(though, given who he truly is, it's not too surprising).Ryuunosuke, a serial killer, summons Caster, who arrives in all his frightening glory. Ryuunosuke offers Caster the last survivor of his latest kills, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> child, for Caster. Caster draws a book of spells...but then unties the boy and kindly instructs him to leave. However, the second the boy gets to the door, Caster summons....SOMETHING that tears him limb from limb, explaining that offering hope, then tearing it away creates the most despair, to Ryuunosuke's glee.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Prince Clovis is introduced giving a powerful speech condemning an act of terrorism by the Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">resistance</a> which seems pretty conciliatory, as he underscores how loyal Japanese are equal citizens of Britannia. Then a moment later, he is shown going back to socialize at a party, demonstrating that all of that pathos was a put-on. By the end of the episode, he shows his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueColors">True Colors</a> as a neurotic nutjob, by despairing due to C.C's escape to the point of ordering a murderous pogrom on the Japanese ghetto to cover it up. Unlike many of these examples though, Karma catches up with him quickly so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb">he doesn't make it very long in the series</a>.
<ul><li> Clovis's older brother, Prince Schneizel, was kind of the same. He was introduced as a seemingly nice guy who many fans speculated was a heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> in contrast to Lelouch, a ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. Then, he starts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">manipulating</a> the mentally unbalanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius">TV Genius</a> Nina into building a nuclear weapon, uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent">a critical momentary absence of Lelouch to turn the Black Knights against said leader,</a> and eventually reveals his plan to nuke millions of people and declare himself God. And using his half-sister Nunnally, also very unstable at the moment, to such an end</span>. Of course, there was at least one sign prior to this: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">smile</a> as the Avalon prepared to nuke both Suzaku and a pinned-down Zero in the first season.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>; While we see fairly early on that the Amestrian military is a fairly ruthless and potentially dodgy organization, its leader, Fuhrer President King Bradley, presents himself (despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">title</a> and kickass fighting skills) as a more-or-less benign individual who does what he thinks is best for his country and his beloved family. He even offers to help our heroes fight the conspiracy inside the military. Then it's revealed that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a homunculus and part of the aforementioned conspiracy, not to mention the one who ordered the Ishval civil war and subsequent genocide campaign</span>. Despite this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's among the most human (not necessarily sympathetic) of the homunculi and it seems that his love for his wife, in the manga at any rate, is genuine.</span>
<ul><li> To add to that, Bradley is shown to be shaking during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hughes' funeral</span>, one of the major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerkers</a> of the series. When Mustang brings this event up, it is revealed that he was, in fact, shaking with anger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the noise that Hughes' daughter Elicia was causing, as she cried over her father being buried.</span>
</li><li> Amazingly, the series manages to one-up this. Selim Bradley is a cute little kid who looks up to his father, studies hard so he can help the country when he grows up and fanboys other characters with big sparkly eyes. Which makes it all the more horrifying when the reader learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not only is he a homunculus but the <em>oldest</em> of the second-generation homunculi and arguably the most powerful and evil. His actual body is a living shadow that tore a group of Briggs soldiers to pieces and left the survivors so traumatized that they were almost <em>insane!</em> That cute little boy form is more like a shell that he moves within, animating with his shadows</span>. Worst of all, his poor mother has no idea that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her family is evil homunculi (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">although they both seem to care about her in their own ways</a>)</span>.
</li><li> Shou Tucker initially appears to be a kindly state alchemist with a loving daughter Nina and her equally adorable dog Alexander, who the Elric Brothers eventually end up meeting. Even when it turns out that his wife left him, it could be argued that he had learned from his mistakes since then and that he was still a good father even if he wasn't a good husband. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it turns out that his wife hadn't actually left him. Shou Tucker had condemned the rest of her life to one of pain and suffering after he transformed her into a Half-Human Hybrid. And as if that wasn't enough, he later does the same thing to Nina and Alexander. Notably, he is the only character in the franchise the "In Memoriam" omakes don't depict going to Heaven...instead, he's burning in Hell.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in one scene involving Kimblee. When he gets out of prison, he expresses his "gratitude" for "taking care" of him by using alchemy to create a bomb attached to the wrist of one of the guards. The "bomb" turns out to be a toy, however, and Kimblee suggests that the guard give it to his kid as a present.

Teach aka Blackbeard, our story's likely true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> first started out as a rather jolly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> and at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> type, always encouraging Luffy to get stronger, caring for his crewmates, etc. Then fast-forward to the Maineford Arc, where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mocks Whitebeard, feigns sympathy with him, then gleefully steals his Devil Fruit, revealing himself to have always been just a power-hungry megalomaniac.</span> And it's likely this won't be the first thing he does like this, before and after either.
</li><li> Eustace Kidd, at first presented as being disgusted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">World Government Slave Auctions</a> and setting himself up as a worthy opponent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Luffy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Trafalgar Law</a>. Roughly a hundred chapters later, he's seen crucifying pirates attempting to flee the ludicrously dangerous sea of the New World. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the only reason Kidd's bounty was higher than Luffy's is that Kidd leaves a trail of corpses wherever he goes. When he said that he kills anybody who laughs at his dreams, he's not joking.
</li><li> While his most acts of horrific violence have been off-screen, it was soon obvious that Trafalgar Law himself isn't the mellow pretty boy he acts. He sent the hearts of 100 pirates to the world government to become a Warlord of the Sea. It was later revealed that by his power, these hearts are possibly still beating and the people who lose them are still alive but now at the mercy of the one who holds their heart, who can crush it to kill them. No word on how many of the hundred victims are still alive. It's also worth noting that in his first appearance, the other Supernovas were as wary of him as they were of Kidd. The trope seems to have been ultimately subverted with Law, as while he can be terrifying to deal with, he turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> who was simply doing all he could to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> take down Donflamingo, who killed Law's savior and father figure Corazon</span> and instead became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryTrueCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryTrueCompanion">Honorary True Companion</a> of the Straw Hats. Unlike Kid, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> showed a softer side.
</li><li> Inverted with Jimbei. When we first heard of Jimbei, being Arlong's former captain and the one who let Arlong run wild in East Blue, it seems like Oda was setting Jimbei up to be a major villain. Who would have thought that he would actually be an honorable and a decent person, become one of the Straw Hats' biggest allies but also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> be invited by Luffy to join the crew</span>?
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vice-Admiral Vergo</span> did this to G-5.

Mina is a badass fighter and provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">lesbianism</a> and Genma is highly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">affable and funny</a> and seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a>. Then, in the third episode, you have them ambushing a squad of Russian soldiers. Genma hijacks a train and as he uses it to kill, you see the mangled body of the conductor next to him. Then, after Mina shows up and slaughters several more soldiers, Gemna creates a gas explosion to kill the remainder and during this whole time, finds this carnage absolutely hilarious.

All of this is done after we get introduced via a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> flashback and get to see him do the twist to some funky 70's music on the radio.
</li><li> And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackieBrown">Jackie Brown</a></em>, we assume we're on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>'s side, because he seems like his character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>, with some funny lines about AK-47's and a stoner girlfriend, etc. He goes on to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shoot or threaten to shoot most of the characters in the movie</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a>'s character is the same, except we don't find out until much later on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he shoots his/Ardell's girlfriend dead because she wouldn't stop talking</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> has Lou Bloom — a socially awkward but nice kid of recent generations, forced into thievery and petty crime by the horrible economy, something that everyone, from Millennials to Boomers, has felt. He's good with tech, and tries to make an effort to be nice, and social, and is eager to learn, right? Even though his job, and focus of the film, capitalizes on sensationalism and suffering, well, that's just something everyone in this economy's had to swallow, right? Surely, that doesn't include stuff like sexual extortion, evidence rigging, eliminating the competition, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outright murder</span>, right...? He's not someone like Sheldon Cooper or Steve Urkel — he's really Patrick Bateman. To be fair, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murders a security guard to steal his watch</span> right at the beginning of the film.
</li><li> Maman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlumdogMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlumdogMillionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a></em>. A viewer might be slightly suspicious when this man is offering homeless children soda and giving them a home in an orphanage. You may think he's a little shady, but not too terrible when he has the children panhandle in exchange for food and board. Then when he really likes you, you get to sing for him. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">he has a way</a> to make every singing orphan worth double.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BartonFink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BartonFink">Barton Fink</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Charlie seems like a lovable oaf and becomes Barton's only real friend. Then it turns out he's a homicidal maniac who probably killed his girlfriend and gave her head to him in box.</span>
</li><li> The 1945 American Propaganda film <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.archive.org/details/MyJapan1945">My Japan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, whose message is "Holy shit, Japan is badass" bookends scenes of Japanese brutality with tranquil koi ponds.

He's introduced as a likable chap who has a gift for bringing people in to be enlightened in the titular imaginarium. It's shown that he was involved in some sort of scandal about a children's charity, but he still comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>. Then it's revealed that he was selling the children's organs on the black market. The man triggers an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a> reaction in the Devil himself.</span>
</li><li> Done deliberately with the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SecretWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SecretWindow">Secret Window</a></em>—according to the director, by the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">our protagonist finally snaps completely and kills his ex-wife and her boyfriend</span>, we were meant to be too involved with him to stop cheering him on.
</li><li> Any horror film where they don't show who the killer is before the big reveal. Especially in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream">Scream</a></em> film series where Ghostface turns out to be someone you wouldn't expect to be a homicidal mass murderer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em> Warden Norton is a hypocritical jerkass, but you can somewhat understand where he's coming from, and his dictatorial rule can be somewhat excused as the necessary actions of a man trying to maintain order over an institution of violent criminals. You get the feeling he's maybe not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">all</a></em> bad when he talks to Tommy in private asking him if he'd be willing to testify to Andy's innocence. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Tommy agrees, Norton has him shot by Hadley, just so Norton doesn't have to give up having Andy do his paperwork for him, and we know once and for all, no, Norton does not have <em>any</em> good intentions in mind, and he really is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">rotten to the core.</a></span>
</li><li> A subtle example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>. There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a> shot of Silk Spectre in her form-fitting costume, then a cut to the Comedian leering at her. He's a cool superhero type, and he's also just a guy like us! Then, moments later, he tries to rape her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, Magneto and the Brotherhood team up with the X-Men in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> battle against a racist, genocidal military colonel. Magneto's more or less leading a rescue mission to save Professor Xavier, and the two teams fight together so well (the movie's even subtitled "X-Men United") that you can't help but cheer him on and start to wonder if, all things considered, he's really such a bad guy. And then he proceeds to remind the audience that yes, he really is a villain, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">instead of rescuing him, he tries to use the captive, brainwashed Xavier to kill every <em>non-mutant</em> on Earth</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dragonheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a></em> we first see Einon as though he is like any other fantasy hero, who was given Draco's heart and the audience assumes it would be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAndHisX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAndHisX">A Boy and His X</a>. But in a few minutes, we see that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">spoiled prince</a> who is even more oppressive and cruel than his father. When he forces the rebels to help build his new castle, he has their leader blinded for good measure.
<ul><li> Though the signs were present long before that. It was, in fact, the moment he came upon his dying father and tried to steal his crown that got him injured badly enough to need a dragon heart transplant in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> The robber in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> is introduced to us this way. He's behind Peter in line at a convenience store, who is trying to buy chocolate milk and is two cents short. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> clerk won't even let him make up the difference from the "take a penny/leave a penny" jar because he hasn't paid enough. As Peter leaves, the robber tosses his money on the floor, making the clerk bend down to get it, empties the register while he is distracted, and tosses Peter the milk. Since the robbery was non-violent, the robber was nice to Peter, and the clerk was a jerk, you are tempted to like the guy and understand why Peter doesn't stop him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moments later he has murdered Uncle Ben for getting in his way.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em>, the audience is introduced to Mysterio, a long-running famous Spidey villain in the comics, as the heroic Quentin Beck of another universe, who helps Peter and SHIELD take down the Elementals wrecking havoc across Europe, while counseling Peter about the responsibilities of being a hero. It's not until halfway through the film when Peter hands Beck the EDITH software Tony bequeathed him as a torch-passing when the ruse is revealed: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Beck, a bitter Stark Industries ex-employee, made up his heroic persona and backstory to gain back the EDITH software that he developed in order to one-up Stark's legacy, building trust with Peter to get him to hand it over. From there, he has no qualms about wanting to kill Peter and his classmates to keep them from exposing him as a fraud amongst other villainy.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GForce">G-Force</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Speckles.</span>
</li><li> The Japanese horror classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Audition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Audition">Audition</a></em> perfectly fits this trope.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SideEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SideEffects">Side Effects</a></em> proves to be this with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main female protagonist Emily. The film seems like it's a cautionary tale about the dangers of prescription medicine with Emily being the tragic victim. Only to reveal that she used prescription drugs as cover to kill her husband, set up her psychiatrist to take the blame, and get rich off the stock market</span>.
</li><li> Annie Wilkes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Misery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Misery">Misery</a></em>. She saves the author Paul Sheldon from a deadly car crash in the middle of a blizzard. She makes it clear to be a huge fan of his books. She seems dedicated and delighted to nurse his wounds until he makes a full recovery. Though she almost violently disagrees with Sheldon's new book, it's just the actions of a passionate fan. Nothing wrong with that, right? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Too bad she's revealed to be a psychopath that has no intention of letting Sheldon go or let anyone know he's still alive. Then it's revealed that she had a dark past where she poisoned her husband and was a nurse who poisoned many of her patients.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a></em>: Captain Vidal is introduced as a stern militant, with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a> to go along with his fascism. He's polite to Carmen and stern to Ofelia. When he finds a couple of hunters who his men have captured, he searches their bags, finding some tobacco and a beer bottle. He shushes them whenever they talk, and when the younger hunter insists that the other, his father is telling the truth, Vidal calmly walks up to him and beats his face in with the beer bottle. Then he shoots the man's father (not even bothering to warn the soldier who was standing right behind the man, who could have been killed by the exit wound if he hadn't moved away), and calmly shoots the first hunter. He later finds that they were only hunters, and tells his men to do a better job of searching before they bring people to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellraiserBloodline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellraiserBloodline">Hellraiser: Bloodline</a></em>, Pinhead appears to be petting a little white dove in one scene. He promptly feeds it to his hellhound the Chatterbeast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheIronFists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheIronFists">The Man with the Iron Fists</a></em>, Brass Body is introduced playing with some orphans and cheering them up. He is later shown to be a ruthless murderer and rapist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack">Pitch Black</a></em>: So it seems like Riddick, after all this talk about how bad he is, might be an alright guy after all when he prevents Jack from getting killed and used as bait by Johns. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then Riddick leaving the others to die as soon as it becomes a viable option really drives home the point of what a scumbag he can be.</span>
</li><li> Several cases in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>: Kylo Ren, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealed as Ben Solo, confronts his father on Starkiller Base. Han tries to talk him down, and Kylo seems to be listening, admitting to feeling conflicted and asking for Han's help. Then he murders Han, ensuring his fall to the Dark Side so he doesn't have to feel conflicted anymore.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kylo Ren has another moment when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's shown that even after murdering Han Solo, he still feels torn between the Dark Side and the Light. He passes up a chance to kill Leia, and when he murders his own master to save Rey's life and fights off the Praetorian Guard by her side, it seems like he's redeemed himself. Although he has sincere feelings for Rey, his next act is to deliver a completely sincere but sociopathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a> speech to her. When she declines, he takes over the First Order and demands they destroy the last survivors of the Resistance, including her.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> DJ is something of a slovenly jerk, but he fits right in with the grand Star Wars tradition of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">grumpy bear</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">Then he sells the Resistance out to the First Order at a moment's notice to save his own skin</a>, apathetically telling Finn and Rose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal">"they blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow."</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHatefulEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHatefulEight">The Hateful Eight</a></em> is filled with this trope, both played straight and inverted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Prisoner is shown as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>. She is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> or arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the movie. The Hangman is shown as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, but he proves to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> of the movie. The Sheriff is shown as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a> but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a>. The Mexican is shown as charming and misunderstood, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>, same with The Cow Puncher. And The Little Man is shown as a head of authority but is really a Mook. The Bounty Hunter seems like a nobleman but is really an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a>.

The first half of the film focuses on each of the characters so that the viewer can grow attached to them, making the reveals later powerful.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2">RoboCop 2</a></em>: When RoboCain runs into his former lover Angie in the warehouse shoot-out, he lowers his gun and tries to caress her face with his robotic hands, almost seeming like he'll let her live... before snapping her neck. Presumably out of frustration, since he can no longer enjoy a woman in his roboticized state.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner2049" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner2049">Blade Runner 2049</a></em>: While rather creepy and unsettling from the very beginning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Niander Wallace</a> at first appears to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Benevolent Boss</a> like his predecessor Eldon Tyrell, cradling a newborn Replicant in his arms and tenderly wiping the birthing-fluid from her body while softly whispering "Happy birthday" to her. A few minutes later, he talks about the fact that his Replicants being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unable to reproduce</span> makes them useless to him, whereupon he slices her abdomen open with a knife and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">lets her bleed to death.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube">Cube</a></em>, Quentin naturally becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> as he seems protective, competent and sympathetic. After a narrow escape, he loses his temper and launches a hateful, sexist tirade against Halloway. She responds with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech">"Reason You Suck" Speech</a> and calls him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a> pretending to be a good guy.

He looks back, and his expression changes to a cold, murderous stare. He lets her drop.</span> From this point onward, Quentin is a dangerous villain.
</li><li> Used chillingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave">12 Years a Slave</a></em>. When Eliza is separated from her children at the slave auction and is weeping at the plantation, Ford's wife pities her and says, "Have some food and rest. Your children will soon be forgotten." It doesn't seem to occur to her that blacks might love their children every bit as much as white people. Moreover, Ford's wife later demands to her husband that Eliza be sold as she "makes too much noise" (as in she cries too much for her tastes), casting some doubt over how genuine her pity was to begin with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mowlgi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mowlgi">Mowlgi</a></em>, John Lockwood is patient and merciful with Mowgli, and takes him under his wing. Then Mowgli gets a look inside his hut.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnivesOut">Knives Out</a></em>, some of the Thrombeys, particularly the women and Walt, appear to treat Marta nicely and even promise that they will take care of her because she is like one of the family. But the moment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's revealed that Marta is the sole inheritor of Harlan's fortune</span>, they all turn on her in some way or another and attempt to blackmail her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks">Mars Attacks!</a></em>: The president gives an impassioned speech to the Martian leader and two other Martians, offering them peace.

Cue the sequel, and it turns out he is <em>far worse</em> than Heihachi ever was, turning into a full-blown villain, and has remained that way ever since. You could actually get a hint of Kazuya's evil side in <em>Tekken 1</em> if you bought the PlayStation port and completed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga">the minigame</a>, whereas you find out that his alter ego is Devil (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em>2</em>). Though later installments reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">he became evil because of circumstances that were out of his control in the past</a>, he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">revel</a> in the massive power he got and being a ruthless bastard overall so he's still considered evil.
</li><li> <em>Tekken 6</em> seemingly repeated this on Kazuya's son Jin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain">After spending the previous three games as a tortured but ultimately heroic figure fighting against all sorts of evils stemming from the Mishima family tree</a>, Jin's ending in the fifth game sees him take control of the Mishima Zaibatsu and—as shown in <em>T6</em>—promptly use its resources to start what is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Jin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to awaken Azazel and destroy it along with his cursed bloodline, ultimately subverting the trope.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Arthas Menethil. While he's first seen, he may seem to be a genuinely good person put through horrible circumstances to the point his desire to save his country makes him do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and eventually gets promoted into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. It wasn't later that supplemental materials reveal that he's not as goody-goody as his debut game pre-insanity showed him to be, and it's heavily hinted that Arthas!Lich King's over-inflated sense of pride and ego comes from Arthas' own.
</li><li> In the opening cinematic of <em>The Burning Crusade</em> expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, you see a rather beautiful Blood Elf woman playing with a creature made primarily of mana in a graceful, Disney Princess kind of way... and after about 8 seconds of this, she forcibly drains the things essence out, killing it. This establishes the blood elves' sinister, mana-addicted nature hiding underneath their extravagant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">High People</a> aesthetic.
</li><li> In <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, Drakuru starts off as a morally dubious but generally affable troll who aids the player in taking down the forces of the Drakkari Trolls, who are large and dangerous enough to put up a fight even against the Scourge. After helping cleanse their forces, you find out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drakuru is actually in league with Arthas to eliminate the Drakkari threat and turn them over to the Scourge. You get the chance to repay him for his betrayal during a quest line in Zul'Drak.</span>
</li><li> Sylvanas Windrunner herself eventually becomes this trope as the franchise goes on. While she was always evil as an undead (as a living High Elf, she was no different than every other elves, mostly being neutral), she only ended up that way because Arthas forcibly turned her into her undead servant, but she managed to rebel and strike out on its own and after being taken in by Thrall into the Horde, she adapted a "very very morally dubious, but only does things for the survival of her people and won't strike indiscriminately" stance. She was even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">lighter shade of black</a> during the final battle against Arthas, finally claiming her vengeance. And... that's where it goes downhill. Afterwards, Sylvanas digs further and further into "unquestionably evil", starts misusing her own people to save her own hide disregards anything that has a life form, because she saw what it's like if she were to die again (since she just finished her vengeance and it felt empty) and she does not like it one bit. From that point on, she loses whatever moral grayness she had and became just as bad as Arthas was.
</li></ul></li><li> Aside from his flashback appearance, Kefka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> is introduced in the story as a quirky and colorful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousHarlequin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousHarlequin">Villainous Harlequin</a>-like character, humorously demanding that his shoes be emptied of sand <em>in the middle of a desert</em> and generally acting like a goofy manchild. He later reveals himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">sociopath</a> whose idea of fun generally revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">mass genocide</a>.

She waits in Zanarkand as a ghost to greet summoners at the end of their pilgrimage. Until we discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she turns one of the summoner's guardians into a living statue forever and that she knows it's impossible to truly defeat Sin this way</span>.

</li><li> Subverted with Slayer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> XX</em>. One of his intro sequences features him with an attractive woman clinging to him... who he then drains of blood until she's nothing but an empty husk. This <em>seems</em> like a straight application of the trope... until you get into the series story. The woman in question is his wife Sharon, who has the special ability that she simply <em>can't die</em>, period. She kills parasites and disease-causing organisms just by being <em>near</em> them—to the point Eddie (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">body-stealing</a> bioweapon) tries to possess her in one of his endings and <em>melts</em>—and being drained like this is, at worst, a minor inconvenience for her. Slayer <em>is</em> a villain by some readings (he's not just an assassin, he's the founder and former head of the guild), but his relationship with his wife is one of his better aspects.

Rankai, the monk, is actually just motivated by vengeance and will do anything to see Jinkuro die, including <em>selling Momohime's soul to a demon</em>, while Jinkuro, although still very much a villain, isn't quite as callous and devoid of redeeming features as he first appears.

But if you thought that you were oh so wrong. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Battle of Azure City</a>, where Xykon went full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Hero Killer</a> in some incredibly horrible ways, proved <em>exactly</em> how wrong that belief was.

Burlew has occasionally written little essays on how D&amp;D is played and storylines are formed on his website. In a number of these pieces, he talks about giving depth to the villains, and how evil people can have friends, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">Even Evil Has Loved Ones</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship">two villains working together aren't always just looking to turn on each other at the first opportunity</a>.

</li><li> When General Tarquin was introduced he got a lot of fans for affability, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">savvy</a>, and style. And of course <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's Elan's father</span>. It's since become apparent that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he uses his position as de facto ruler of the Empire of Blood to force any woman he fancies to marry him, often through outright torture. Which makes him <em>rather less</em> likable.

</li><li> The same goes for his partner Minister Malack.

Then came "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E24Bubbled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E24Bubbled">Bubbled</a>" wherein Eyeball and Steven are trapped together and while at first, it seems Eyeball is coming around when Steven heals her, in actuality she draws a knife and goes after him. Unlike the other Rubies, Eyeball is played as a legit threat to the defenseless Steven being a fanatical and unhinged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">Sociopathic Soldier</a> who intends to kill him to achieve fame on her home planet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em>: The Book serves to flesh out and humanize the Apex more. Simon, in particular, has a number of sympathetic moments showing how he cares for Grace <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the audience learns that he's been trapped on the train since he was 10. In "The Color Clock Car", he finally starts to warm up to Tuba, sharing a laugh with her and helping her through the car. The episode ends with Simon killing her by throwing her under the wheels of the train, gloating about it to Grace and Hazel, and it's all downhill for the remainder of the season.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero</a></em>: At first it appears that Rippen's parents Axalon and Hedwin and younger sister Vlurgen were calling to celebrate Rippen's birthday in the episode "Mr. Rippen". But it becomes clear they were using calling on his birthday as an excuse so they can mock him for his failures as a villain while rubbing his sister's success in his face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> introduces Norman Osborn as a cold-blooded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who emotionally abuses his son, Harry, and conducts potentially lethal experiments on human test subjects to create super villains as part of a deal with the local crime lord. However, the way Norman effortlessly turns every underhanded dealing to his advantage and his smooth exterior makes him a character very easy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">Love to Hate</a>. When his son, Harry, is exposed as the Green Goblin, Norman finally begins showing a more human side, blaming himself for Harry's transformation and even offering to take the blame for the Goblin's crimes to protect him. Afterwards, he starts acting like a real father to his son. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except it's all a lie. Norman Osborn was the Green Goblin from the beginning and he took advantage of his son's drug addiction and blackouts to frame him for his own crimes. Norman's offer to take the fall and supposed guilt was just a way to manipulate Spider-Man to stop investigating the Goblin, and Norman—whether in the Green Goblin persona or not—proves himself a total sociopath when it's revealed he twisted his son's leg just to enforce his cover story.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>: The episode <em>Autoboot Camp</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a> showing how Bumblebee and Bulkhead first met. At the titular camp, Bumblebee is constantly insulted and beat up by his instructor Sentinel Minor and the other Elite Guard candidates (so basically all the other attendees except Bulkhead, who wants to be a space bridge technician instead). And then there's Longarm, who encourages Bumblebee in his attempts to expose Wasp as a Decepticon spy, helping Bumblebee out when Wasp and Ironhide stuff him into a locker after cutting his legs off and informing Bumblebee of his last opportunity to expose Wasp before Sentinel takes the credit. Bumblebee and Longarm are shown to be good friends in the present day, and it makes sense considering how Longarm comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>... except then the end of the episode shows that Longarm is in fact, the <em>real</em> Decepticon spy Bumblebee was looking for, Shockwave, and that his encouragement was to get an innocent bot (an innocent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, but still...) arrested to draw suspicion away from himself. To rub the point home further, Shockwave later decides to rub it in Bumblebee's face that he was the real spy, cementing that he never really considered him a friend.
