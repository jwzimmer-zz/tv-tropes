</p><p>In a film where cities are destroyed, this trope runs as rampant as the disasters themselves. No matter how many warnings the populace has, no matter if there have been fissures opening in the streets for days or giant alien spaceships hovering overhead, there are always a huge number of people who are just there to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">stare in disbelief</a> right before being obliterated. Unfortunately, this has more than a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. The trope is justified here because seeing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">empty city</a> trashed is not as emotional as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">knowing millions are dying</a>.

</p><p>This is also used poetically (mostly in fantasy) in making the statement that magical events and miracles takes place all the time and all around us, and people are just too busy, or too distracted to see it. But in extreme fantasy it could be that the citizens ignore the flying horse, disappearing church, or whatever the event, because it is a common-place occurrence in that world.

Here, they look, but go about their business. What makes this ad more disturbing is not only the reactions of the people, and the fact that this is happening to a young boy, but we do not even see his parents, and the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a father carries his daughter over where the death occurs and moves her around the blood of the boy.</span> None of the bystanders laugh or seem pleased about the situation, but it is curious at the least all of the reactions we see from everyone including the boy himself, so much reactions in one minute ad. Bystander syndrome is scary enough in real life, but this is exaggerated despite its horrific realism. Because all these things, this ad could swerve over to the category of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">Nausea Fuel</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was particularly guilty of this trope, especially during the Buu Saga. When Goku and Vegeta attempted to get the Earth to donate energy to the Spirit Bomb, the people (besides their friends and family) outright refused, even mocking them. Mr. Satan was legitimately angered at this, as the planet was giving the middle finger at their one and only chance to destroy Majin Buu once and for all, and ended up calling them out for it. Ironically, its him calling them out that got them to do it. Many people said (though possibly only the dub) that it might have just been some trick by Buu, or something to that effect. It was the fact that Mr. Satan is THE MOST FAMOUS HEROIC CHAMPION FIGHTER ON EARTH (since the Z warriors all shun fame and let him take credit for the Cell Games) that they got on board... Though oddly nobody questioned if HIS voice was a trick, probably because the one thing Mr. Satan shares with his namesake other than the name is epic bullshitting.
</li><li> In the anime movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em>, two of the main characters, Howl and Sophie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">walk across the street in mid-air</a> while the street below them is crowded with nearly hundreds of townsfolk dancing. Perhaps they simply never looked up?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient">Panzer World Galient</a></em>: The Lanplatians. Even when a tower falls on their friends right in front of them, they just stand there drooling in confusion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marder's grand plan is actually to make them forget this and care about *something* again.</span>
</li><li> Shows up a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki">Shiki</a></em>, where most of the villagers are utterly apathetic about the vampires taking over the town (they think it's an epidemic of disease, but <em>still</em>). An epidemic is one thing, but the town having dozens of deaths, and slowly being repopulated by pale people who only work at night, you'd think they'd be at least a little suspicious. This ends up frustrating Doctor Ozaki to no end resulting in him hatching a plan to try and get the villagers to act.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, citizens don't care that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Togusa</span> had just been shot and now lay bleeding out on the sidewalk. They just want to get out of the rain... although one citizen does cautiously approach him at the very last second before the episode fades out to the credits.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played Straight</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> - Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">The Sybil System</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">regulated Psycho Pass Scans</a>, violent crime has been diminished to the point where it's practically become a non-existent concept. So when a man using a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Psycho Pass Blocking helmet</span> is beating a woman to death <em>in the middle of the street, in broad day light, in front of millions of witnesses no less</em>, the citizens <em>barely</em> register what's happening and one guy even starts making a video recording of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, people get killed off all the time in public, or escorted out of the public to be killed in gruesome manners, and no one ever seems to pay much attention to the corpses on the streets or rampant disappearances, not even reporting them to the police. The Hunters are the only ones shown to take note of frequent deaths and disappearances in some particular area, and most of them display no empathy whatsoever, using said knowledge as clues to further their own ends. Ordinary civilians recount horrific events casually to their co-workers and comrades in a casual manner with little reaction from the people they speak to. The main character, Gon, is one such exception to this rule; any death he sees weighs heavily on him, as long as they haven't proven themselves an irredeemable murderous scumbag to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> the people of Earth are quite apathetic to the Invid rule and the attempts of the Robotech Expeditionary Force and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the few partisan fighters</a> to take them down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> by the fact that not only they leave Humans alone as long as they don't try to get more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Protoculture</a> than they're alloted or pose a danger to them (overlapping categories, as most mechas and weapons capable of fighting the Invid require Protoculture as fuel), but they've also repaired Earth's ecosystem after the Zentraedi bombardment at the end of the First Robotech War nearly collapsed it, so the citizens of Earth have little reason to oppose the conquerors <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and will sometimes even <em>help them</em>, luring the unsuspecting soldiers into ambushes and leaving before the Invid attack</span>.
</li><li> In the <em>very first episode</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, some thugs try to rape a woman in full view of a busy street, right in front of a convenience store where Light is (ostensibly) reading a manga. Later, an FBI agent has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHeartAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHeartAttack">Hollywood Heart Attack</a> at a busy subway station, and <em>no one</em> seems to notice or care. Later still, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Matt</span> is shot by Takada's bodyguards, while hundreds (or even thousands) of people just look on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the entire Uchiha clan is killed in a single night and nobody but Sasuke (the sole survivor) seem to care at all. It's true that the Uchiha clan weren't on great relations with the rest of the village <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and were in fact planning a coup</span>, but wouldn't somebody at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">Think of the Children!</a> You'd think the Uchiha clan would have at least <em>some friends</em> outside the family that would be devastated by this. Even if we assume people simply didn't care about them, this is still a ludicrous scenario. There is a mass murderer who can kill an entire clan on the loose and as far as they know, he could come back and come after <em>them too</em>. The Uchiha clan was at least one of the founding members of Konoha and were killed in a single night. What made the other clans think they could do any better? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, there's the fact Itachi was <em>ordered</em> to do this by the village leaders in secret, was always still loyal to the village, and he was actually just one of two perpetrators of the act, so there are hints there was quite a government cover up at work about this.</span>

<ul><li> The usual citizens of the Marvel and DC universes do not usually react to people using superpowers or flying around in costumes. After all, after some decades of ongoing continuity, it would not be realistic to expect them to keep pointing "it's a bird, it's a plane..." The exception is when there is a severe fight or destruction: people that keep shopping while Terrax or Despero destroy the buildings some meters away would be too much. Another exception (or not) is when the characters go back in time; the unusual overreactions to superheroes make it even more clear that they are not "at home".

However, while Epicureanism teaches that one should strive for tranquility, and the Stoics too, both philosophies using the word "apathaia" for this from which we get "apathy", neither meant what we now mean by the word. They had different doctrines regarding "tranquility", but in both cases they didn't mean one should not care <em>at all</em> for others. Rather, for Epicureans one should not <em>seek out</em> conflict and adversity, trying to live peacefully with people (or if that wasn't possible, getting away from them or fighting back if attacked). The Stoics are notorious as preaching indifference, but that also isn't the whole story. It's true they did teach we should not let passions rule, but that didn't mean moral concern toward others wasn't good-on the contrary, they said one should act on this. However, they recognized that no matter what, people will face hardship, and said we can control its effects on us (thus maintaining "tranquility" rather than giving in to emotion), not indifference for others' hardships entirely.

<ul><li> In <em>City of Heroes</em>, though, pedestrians who get too close to enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">often cringe and run back the way they came</a>.
</li><li> The apathy is even more apparent if one tries to talk to the civilians. Rogue Islanders are rather dismissive of supervillainy, to the point of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarkers</a>! ("Let me guess. You're the Dark Something or Other.")
</li><li> Prime Example of this: During a <em>Deadly Apocalypse</em> special event (which is heralded by thick fog, dramatic music, and the sudden appearance of ominous banners throughout the zone), Paragon Citizens will run for cover. Islanders? <em>Don't even react</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege II: Broken World</a></em> hits the "<em>reallllly</em> pessimistic" part right on the head. A lot of the Elves go on pessimistic monologues that would make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">goth</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe">Nietzsche Wannabe</a> proud.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Emerald</a></em> Version takes the cake: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the weather's gone to hell, two ancient titans are intent on destroying one another, Hoenn and <em>possibly the entire world</em> are in jeopardy...</span>and that kid in Mossdeep is still rambling on about the rock Steven gave him. Whoop-dee-freaking-doo, now evacuate before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your island floods.</span>
<ul><li> But at least most of the people in that area seemed worried, and their doors were locked.
</li><li> It gets worse when you're trying to solve the issue present in the Hoenn games, and trainers <em>in the general area</em> of the disaster will challenge you to a battle, despite the blistering heat or deluge of rain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Platinum</a></em>, people seem worried too... if they're in the area. This trait is carried on from <em>Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mention goes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonHeartGoldAndSoulSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonHeartGoldAndSoulSilver">Pokemon Heart Gold And Soul Silver</a></em>, where you can have the god of the entire Pokemon universe following you around and no one seems to notice. Well, except the guys at the Ruins of Alph.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>; at one point N suggests that if everybody else in Unova cared about their Pokemon half as much as you do, he wouldn't have a cause, but they don't, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">he does</a>.
<ul><li> At least in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em>, this is averted with the Gym Leaders. Unlike the previous generations where the Gym Leaders are just as apathetic as everyone else, the Leaders from seven of the eight Unova gyms are actively involved in opposing N and Team Plasma.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, two people in the town's Pokemon Center do notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an enormous crystalline weapon has risen from the ground in the middle of Geosenge Town, destroying several houses in the process, and that Team Flare has seized control of their town.</span> On the other hand, another guy in the Pokémon Center is still too busy talking about the TM he gave you earlier to notice anything unusual. But what really takes the cake is Phil the Photo Guy, as you can still call him to take your picture in the middle of all this, and he doesn't acknowledge any of what's going on. When you call him up, he just goes about his business like usual. Even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the crisis is averted, nobody really does anything to fix the damage done around Geosenge's north end</span>, and everyone in town seems relatively unphased by the ordeal.
</li><li> <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> play this game about as straight as the originals, but mercifully make the people of Mossdeep panic as well. It's a little more egregious given the nature of the BuzzNav which reports everything to every Trainer faster than Speed Forme Deoxys; <em>everyone should know about this and be panicking</em>, but only half the country cares.
</li></ul></li><li> In a combination of the giant meteor in the sky and the clownish madman trying to destroy the world, the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> has the possessed Skull Kid bringing the moon down on Termina. Reactions range from "Gee, the moon's getting bigger..." to plans in a Bomb Shop for trying to GET to said moon using bombs. Even the Mask Salesman who starts you on your journey doesn't do anything himself, only shaking you if you go back to him without the eponymous mask.
<ul><li> To be fair, he knows EXACTLY what to do about it. He also knows he can't do anything to help.
</li><li> The <em>entire</em> series is filled with civilians who are surprisingly okay with Link walking right into their houses and breaking their jars to take what's inside, although those same people will, on occasion, demand repayment for breaking down their door...
<ul><li> Parodied hilariously with <a class="urllink" href="http://wizard.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/halolz-dot-com-thelegendofzelda-li.jpg">this image.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a>, <em>anyone</em> in Skyloft will let you <strong>sleep in their bed</strong>. Especially Beedle, who complains how your sleeping in his bed made him have to peddle even harder just to keep his floating shop afloat. He says he doesn't mind, but he certainly complains about it enough.
</li></ul></li><li> And let's be fair: in the last six hours before the crash, everyone's finally gotten off their behinds to start rioting/crying/expecting imminent death. Rather sudden after 66 hours of apathy, but at least they finally showed <em>some</em> emotion.
</li><li> Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that there ARE people screaming at the mayor to get everyone out of the city. Others don't want people panicking and urge him to continue with the festival. The people are planning to go to the ranch to avoid the problem. People are freaked and either have no idea what to do or come up with very inadequate plans. Kafei and most of the other side quest stuff... not so much. Hey, my girlfriend is going to be crushed by a gigantic grinning rock, can you help me get this mask back?
</li><li> Essentially, the people aren't really apathetic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">but are in denial</a>. On the third day when it's made abundantly clear that the moon <em>will</em> fall, they break. The sidequest stuff could also be explained by most of the people being aware that evacuating the town isn't going to save them, so they want to put their affairs in order and enjoy what little time they have left. Not only that, it's the reason that for the major city of the region about to have a huge festival you only see a handful of people roaming the streets, the only people who haven't ALREADY evacuated are the above people in denial.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em> had something of a mix.
<ul><li> Plenty of people were willing to help Link, but sometimes required strange tasks. Getting one key spell, for example, required getting water for a woman when the fountain was the next screen over. Another complained about a trophy being stolen and required its return to get the spell. Clearly there are more important things?
</li><li> Also, the random townspeople were a mixed bag. Some of them were clearly worried with phrases like "You must save Hyrule!" and "Please save our town!". Others expressed "I am much too busy to talk to a stranger" or "I know nothing".
</li><li> Elsewhere in the <em>Zelda</em> universe, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Minish Cap</a></em>, Princess Zelda gets turned to stone, and nobody in town gives a shit. In fact, all they ever seem to give a toss about is how strange the King is acting - by which time you'll probably have seen the cutscene that explains it. Oh, and Kinstones. They LOVE Kinstones.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, nobody seems to notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their beloved Queen Zelda has disappeared. They don't even talk about her all that much</span> or even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hyrule Castle is surrounded by an impenetrable bubble. And when the city is first filled with darkness, they WATCH the castle BURN and don't seem to really care!</span> To paraphrase Midna: "This city is full of idiots!"
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>, a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> were constantly moaning about how terrible things were. This was later changed to make them less unhappy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a>: Playground of Destruction</em>, the people of North Korea have become so desensitized to the constant shifts in government and the daily assortment of air raids, artillery barrages, mafia killings, and armored offensives that they won't even <em>blink</em> when a heavily armed mercenary rumbles past with a stolen tank.
<ul><li> This shows up in <em>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames</em> as well. Most Venezuelan civilians will keep on driving down the road, even when there is a large running gunfight between mercenaries, People's Liberation Army of Venezuela, the Venezuelan Army, the Chinese Army, <em>and</em> the Allied Nations roaring down the road towards them. However, an interesting aversion sometimes occurs when civilian pedestrians in the major cities run screaming in terror from the various bombing runs and gunfights occurring within city limits.
</li></ul></li><li> Played painfully straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>. The entire world has been torn apart, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> is wreaking havoc at night, and Eggman is being uncharacteristically menacing, yet the only townspeople to show appropriate concern or despair are revealed to be possessed by the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. It's a little bit creepy finding people completely aware of the grim state of the world, yet much more concerned with mundane problems.
<ul><li> Perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by all the shit that's happened before. Angel Island periodically crashes into either the sea or a nearby continent, giant robots (and in one case, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> known as Chaos) regularly attack the city of Station Square, <em>a large chunk of the moon is missing</em> from that one time Eggman got his hands on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, there was that alien invasion a few years back... at this point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">they've probably stopped caring.</a>
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Amy, where she asks why everyone is so laid-back during the crisis.
</li><li> The absolute crowning example of this trope is in the execrable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>. Early on in the game you find yourself impeded by a large door which won't be opened without authorization from the captain of the police force, but the officer who tells you this won't just tell you where to find the captain; apparently, the best use of their time was to devise silly little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightsAndKnaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightsAndKnaves">Knights and Knaves</a> games meant to impede people trying to save the princess. The worst part<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00u27');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note00u27" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00u27');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Aside from the fact that the captain is the guy who gives you the "find the captain" mission, or, in other words, <em>the guy standing right next to the door you want open</em>.</span> is that, when you finally locate the captain, he tells you they gave you the runaround because they just really didn't feel like helping you save their beloved monarch.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, at one point, a planet appears overhead. The two planets are mere miles away from each other, and it turns the sky a bright shade of purple. However, no one seems to be upset that another world is placed so close to theirs, except for one college student, who worries that it might mess up his senior thesis.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, a similar premise takes place when the Adephagos is introduced into the world. Despite it being blatantly obvious in its eventual destruction of the world, the populace, for the most part, doesn't look like they care much. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this is changed when the guilds, Knights, and everyone else joins together to destroy blastia in the hopes of bringing change to the world.</span>
</li><li> Averted in the <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, where you gather weapons and otherwise help a group of farmers rise up to battle an undead invasion. It's even the farmers' idea.
</li><li> While the citizen of Empire City will easily notice Cole and act accordingly to his Karma rating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS">inFAMOUS</a></em>, they have the annoying habit of just standing around while you're duking it out with street gangs and giant robots. While not much of an inconvenience if you're playing as a villain, in which case you can just blast everything in sight, be it villain or civilian, it gets particularly annoying when playing as a hero, and you can't use any of your stronger powers because twenty damn old ladies are between you and baddies.
</li><li> Angband, Moria, and some other Roguelikes partially follow this trope. There's a deep dungeon with the world Ultimate Evil at the bottom, but there's a happy town with merchants all too willing to make a buck off the hero. Though to be fair, it's possible the town has sprung up because of the opportunities in selling equipment to would-be adventurers who promptly get themselves killed, thus ensuring a nice buyback policy once it's "found".
</li><li> In the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, despite having a massive weapon smash through a large portion of New York, much of the citizens in the background simply carry about their business, and the only ones who seem to even notice the damage are the police. Although only a handful are present. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">this is easily the least of the ending's realism problems.</a>
<ul><li> This could also be chalked up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">Rule of Symbolism</a>. Part of the underlying theme of the game's story is about how people can be kept controlled and unquestioning via manipulation of media and authority to help contextualize memetic ideas. Seeing the citizens practically ignore the disaster literally in their midst underscores to the player just how much control of society in general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">The Patriots</a> have.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em>, late in the game, the people of Piata are worried about what will happen to their city when they find out that a huge hole has opened up in the earth north of them and all life around it is dying inexplicably, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing everyone in Mile, a nearby village</span>. They don't do anything about it. I should point out that Piata is called the Town Of Learning because it's the only place <em>in the solar system</em> with a university, and the world's smartest people live there. It does have a notable aversion, though, see below.
</li><li> By late in the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, most of Manhattan is a warzone between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Alex</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Mercer</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">US Marine Corps</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">Shadowy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">the Infected</a>. However, in many areas, traffic is going normally, and people are casually strolling down the streets, right up until Mercer shows up while using any of his visible powers, or the Infected start spreading again. <em>Then</em> they panic. They should know better by now.
<ul><li> For a given value of "visible powers", which is to say his aggressive ones. Want to run straight up the side of a building, glide over to the other side of the street, then land so hard you crack the pavement? Nobody will bat an eye. <em>Not even the military personnel who are supposed to be on the lookout for you</em>.
<ul><li> That may be less apathy/cluelessness, and more savvyness: the guards/pedestrians are hoping that if they pretend they don't see you, you won't murder them horribly and eat their corpse.
</li></ul></li><li> It gets so absurd, that you can stand at the edge of an infected zone and a neutral zone and look left, see people panicking, screaming and freaking out as infected attack them and the military attacks <em>them</em>, then look right and see completely calm people cross the street without a care in the world.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Marine:</strong> Fucking New York...
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> usually averts this, with civilians screaming and running at any sign of danger. But the last mission of <em>Contracts</em> hands you a blatant example- you can mug a paramedic for his clothes with a half-dozen civilians <em>standing five feet away, looking directly at you</em>. It doesn't raise the alarm at all.
<ul><li> In the Mardi Gras level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Blood Money</a></em>, the teeming mass of partygoers choking the streets don't notice or care if 47 is running around having gun battles with cops and thugs dressed as giant birds. They don't even count as living witnesses afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> game is weird about this; sure, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdPanic">Crowd Panic</a> should you be seen with a gun, or get involved in a gunfight, or crash into something... but if you use your car's horn to try and get them out of the way when you're speeding to somewhere, they don't care.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> have the people in the slums practically not care what happens around them or above them on the upper plate. When Sector 7 gets destroyed because of a piece of the upper plate falls on it, several of the NPCs are either mildly surprised or are disgruntled that the destruction caused them an inconvenience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ironically, the citizens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> act this way toward Apathy Syndrome victims. People with Apathy Syndrome can't talk or move, so if they're stuck outside, they can easily become dehydrated or get heat stroke. However, it seems that most people you speak to are too creeped out to get near a victim or can't even be bothered to help. One student even admits to <em>taking pictures of every victim he saw and sending them to his friends</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>: The longer the fog remains in the town, the more apathetic the citizens get. The protagonists worry about this when they notice that the townspeople are more concerned with the latest trending topic than they are about the problems the town is facing. As they later learn, the fog represents self-deceit, and is fueled by the people's desire for a convenient lie over harsh reality. Both of the major villains have the nihilistic belief that this is all there is to mankind, and are willing to grant that wish by forcibly merging the real world with the Shadow world when the fog inevitably grows strong enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: Regularly discussed. Many of the villains bring up the fact they can do the horrible things they've done because the general public are more interested in being told what to do than doing what's right on their own. In fact, the Phantom Thieves decide to continue their activities after the first dungeon in order to encourage people to not be afraid and apathetic anymore.

Especially the rulers of the cities and the empire. At the climax of the main story there is a demonic invasion about to occur outside one of the most important imperial cities. If the battle and the city are lost, the empire will fall as the demons would have a clean march to the heart of the empire. So your character goes around trying to muster support for the coming invasion. If you do everything perfectly (taking over an hour per city), you'll be assisted by...14 standard city guards. Not 14 guards per city. 14 guards total. To top things off, the capital of the empire can't send any troops at all because: "They are too busy protecting the borders". Priorities seem skewed...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> takes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to twelve</a>. The citizens of Kirkwall don't seem to notice or care that the city's most famous resident, a rogue wizard, the captain of the guard, and a pirate are getting into massive, bloody battles in residential neighborhoods.
<ul><li> The issue was present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> would often ignore huge battles taking place right beside them, and outside of one guy in Lothering, none of the Templars seemed to notice that Morrigan was an apostate. Although the latter is rather justified, as Ser Bryant, the leader of the Lothering Templars does point out that his <em>main</em> concern is the approaching Darkspawn horde and as long as they don't cause trouble, he simply has bigger fish to fry than a Mage Warden or their Apostate allies.
</li><li> Another reason is that Templars likely don't want to create a diplomatic incident with the Grey Wardens over arresting their allies, especially in lieu of the Blight and a side-quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em> shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">what happens</a> when the Templars <em>do</em> try to take issue with the Grey Wardens hiring apostates.

Blake explains that Menagerie has been populated by Faunus who are tired of fighting or struggling and just want to be left alone. Asking them to go and fight other people's wars is asking them to put strangers before themselves. Her concern is that the people of Menagerie haven't yet realized that the damage the White Fang will do in the eyes of the humans will affect even Menagerie.
<div class="indent"><strong>Blake</strong>: The Faunus here in Menagerie - the ones that werent born on the island - moved here because they were tired of fighting, of having to struggle constantly. Menagerie is filled with people that just want to be left alone, and here we are, asking them to put the rest of the world before themselves. <br/><strong>Sun</strong>: I guess I never really thought about it like that. <br/><strong>Blake</strong>: The problem is, whatever happens at Haven is going to affect them whether they like it or not. If Adam gets his way and Haven falls, its only going to make things worse for the Faunus. Everywhere.

<ul><li> The Chinese guy who said a proverb which is translated roughly as <em>Only a madman celebrates the change of dynasty</em>, claiming that no matter who is in power, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss">the situation won't change anyhow</a>.
</li><li> There's actually far more Truth in this Trope than you might think. Contrary to the "we don't want to create a panic" cliche, most people tend to underreact to warnings of danger. Freezing is a far more common response than panic.
</li><li> Living creatures in general tend to fit this trope. Unless it impacts the individual or their family members and friends directly, most tend to ignore or else reluctantly react towards whatever is going on. And this fits more than just humans. Animals can react apathetically to an individual's plight as well. Humans ganging up on one member of their species in order to capture/kill them? Well, as long as the ones on the sidelines can get away, then there's nothing to worry about.
</li><li> Towards the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms</a>, the state of Wei (one of the titular Three Kingdoms) finally conquered the rival state of Shu in 264.

The Wu Emperor Sun Hao was also the worst tyrant of the Three Kingdoms, and when an invasion was launched, most of Wu's military forces and civilians couldn't even be bothered to try to defend the state. The invasion went so well that the commanders actually had to halt some of their forces so everyone could catch up.
</li><li> Editor Maxwell Perkins once showed up at a literary party with the aim of proving that no one ever listened to each other at said parties. This he accomplished upon meeting the hostess, saying, "Sorry I'm late, it took longer than expected to strangle my aunt." The hostess' answer? "Oh, of course. So nice of you to come."
</li><li> A similar, probably apocryphal, story is told of Franklin D. Roosevelt, said to have started telling dignitaries as a receiving line, "I strangled my grandmother this morning.". In some versions of the tale, a particularly astute British diplomat responds, "I'm sure she had it coming, Mr. President."
</li><li> The case of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese">Kitty Genovese,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who was raped and stabbed to death near her home in Queens, New York in 1964, is usually cited as an example of this. The media reported that thirty-eight witnesses saw the crime, but nobody called the police. In reality, several calls to the police were made, but no one realized the severity of the attack or the fact that the perpetrator returned to the area to finish the job. Nevertheless, it inspired an investigation of the phenomenon, called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">bystander effect.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> It's the same reason that people with crutches have a more difficult time getting help in crowded cities than in less-populated areas. People just think that someone else will help them if they don't. A similar effect can be noticed with hitchhikers. The more cars, the less chance of getting a lift. People don't feel bad about leaving you there if they think someone else will pick you up. If there's only one car on the road, they figure what the hell and give you a lift.
</li><li> Eliot Aronson, an eminent psychologist cites another, lesser-known case of a woman called Eleanor Bradley in his book <em>The Social Animal</em> after mentioning Genovese. Bradley, while shopping on the Fifth Avenue, fell and broke her leg; she lay on the street for forty minutes, and people just passed her by until somebody finally helped. Aronson suggests that an important factor in this case was that people were able to leave the situation. He cites an experiment where someone pretended to faint in a subway car; they received help in 95% of the cases.
</li><li> In one of his routines, Australian comedian Adam Hills described being caught in a delay on the London Underground: several tubes had to be stopped for at least three-quarters of an hour, due to a possible bomb (not long after the 2005 bombings). The commuters' reactions? Mild annoyance at the delay.
<div class="indent"><strong>Adam Hills:</strong> England is the only country that attempts to fight the war on terror using <em>boredom</em>.
</div><ul><li> Irish comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaraOBriain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaraOBriain">Dara Ó Briain</a> tells a similar joke in regards to both the July London Bombings and the London Olympics:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Dara O'Briain:</strong> The city reacted in a phenomenally London way; the entire place went <em>Oh my God, there's a bomb on the Piccadilly Line.</em> [pause] <em>Well, I can get the Victoria line</em>. The two things happened one day after the other; the announcement of the Olympics and then the bombs going off; the 6th and the 7th and the reaction, essentially, from Londoners was the same: an incredible piece of news, but how am I supposed to get home?
</div><ul><li> Of course, this sort of thing was a pretty regular occurrence until relatively recently courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, so the novelty has probably worn off for most people born before 1990 or so. Also it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLIp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLIp">Britain</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, Israel is sometimes referred to as the only country in the world, where a group of young men with machine guns can walk into a bank and be expected to wait in line. Subverted in that they have to be uniformed soldiers (due to universal conscription there's quite a few of them running about the place).
<ul><li> Israel has its occasional inversions of this trope. Upon seeing a situation that can be resolved with application of overwhelming force (such as say, a terrorist attack involving something other than a suicide bomber), off-duty soldiers that just so happen to be in the area have been known to intervene with lethal efficiency.
</li><li> Not as true today. Certain high-security areas, such as the airport, are a no-gun zone for people other than the security personnel. Movie theaters prohibit entry with rifles. Alcohol-serving locations typically prohibit entry with any weapon. Also, handgun licenses are in a steady decline as they are not renewed except for people with valid reasons. This doesn't make Israel a gun-free zone, but it is a far cry from even 20 years ago,
</li></ul></li><li> Colonel David Hackworth mentions in his autobiography <em>About Face</em> that a newspaper in the US deliberately printed the same front page article on the Korean War three days in a row. If anyone noticed, no one bothered to write in and complain.
</li><li> One newspaper accidentally ran the same horoscopes every day for over a month before anyone noticed (the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect">Barnum Effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> could also be a factor in this case).
</li><li> During periods of history before the advent of the fire department, it was often said that if one so happened to be a victim of a crime and in need of aid, the best course of action would not be yelling the likes of "Help!", "Assault!", "Rape!" or whatnot, but instead shout out "Fire!". People can be very apathetic when it comes to the plight of others, but fire has the added chance of spreading and doing damage to them, making it more likely that people would come to your aid, and end up intervening because they've already spent the effort to make their way over.
<ul><li> Well, as the Smothers Brothers said - "No one is going to come save you if you scream 'Chocolate!'"
</li><li> Books on self-defense for women still advised them to yell "Fire!" in the 1960s.
</li><li> This is also why "shouting fire in a crowded theater" was long considered the stupidest and most insensitive prank a person could play.
</li></ul></li><li> This is sadly common in child abuse cases. Many times, a neighbor or even a relative, sometimes more than one, will report knowing that the abuse was happening and say they actually <em>wanted</em> to do something. This is after the child is dead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> invoked this early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em>.
</li><li> Evidently, there were some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a> in Poland in World War II, and they were swayed to help quarter Russian or German soldiers via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> or two. (Nobody truly admits to doing this, and these could simply be cases of accusing the <em>other side</em> of doing it when they say their village was attacked.)
</li><li> Photographers and journalists for the Associated Press have to deal with this dilemma for their entire careers. A natural disaster has just occurred. People are trapped under rubble and will die in minutes if it isn't cleared away. Do you do your <em>job</em> of recording pictures and footage of the disaster and the victim's plight, or do you do what is right and help them out?
<ul><li> In a strange twist, some photographers have actually faced backlash for 'just doing their job' as was the case with Kevin Carter and his photo of a young girl being stalked by a vulture. After the photo received widespread acclaim, he received a lot of criticism for not intervening and helping the girl, criticism which appeared to haunt him until he took his own life.
</li><li> The film crew of the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops">COPS</a></em> deals with this frequently. On at least a few occasions, they've taken their impartial stance and threw it by the wayside to help, such as assisting a cop performing CPR.
</li></ul></li><li> Derren Brown once hypnotised someone to "assassinate" Stephen Fry. The gun had blanks, and Fry had a blood pack, but the audience Fry was giving a lecture to were completely unaware. When the assassin stood up and emptied a clip "into him", the audience reacted no more than if the power had gone out. They simply stayed in their seats and murmured to each other whilst Fry was dragged offstage.
<ul><li> Though one has to wonder if there wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">another trope</a> at work here, and whether they would have reacted differently if someone other than a famous actor had been the supposed victim.
</li></ul></li><li> Cities with high crime rates tend to have this trope in full force. If a person is lying in the gutter dying from their wounds inflicted from a violent crime, most people ignore the person and keep walking because they fear trying to help the dying victim will get them into trouble from the same person/group of people who tried to kill the victim.
</li><li> Also sad is the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">saving someone can actually be harmful to you</a>. Some people actually use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyDamsel">Decoy Damsel</a> tactic to lure some would-be helper and then attack them. This has stopped many people from even getting help from police and hospitals since being a crime witness for someone you don't even know is not a very fun thing to do for most people.
</li><li> In the US there is a persistent, but false, urban legend that calling an ambulance for a stranger will cause you to be responsible for their medical bills. Uninformed passersbys will sometimes decide not to make the call, thinking that legend is true.
</li><li> Incidentally, in the United States, there are laws called Good Samaritan laws specifically to avoid this trope. They protect any civilian from liability should they try to assist a person who is hurt or is in grave danger and wind up hurting them in the process. Which means if you try to pull someone out from a burning car, for example, and you injure them (or worsen their injuries), the victim cannot legally attempt to sue you for worsening their situation.
</li><li> Sadly, before China enforced its own Good Samaritan laws, many people in China were unwilling to help others in life-or-death situations. There were incidents in China where "Good Samaritans" who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves.
<ul><li> The case of toddler Wang Yue provided a chilling example of this that sparked sheer outrage: she had wandered from home and was infamously run over <em>twice</em> in a Chinese street — and ignored by at least 18 citizens who continued to walk past as if nothing happened — before somebody finally stopped to help. The entire event was caught by a surveillance camera and, for those of you who end up looking it up, be warned it is extremely graphic.
</li><li> Sometimes the authorities in China will arrest someone for simply calling for an ambulance for someone who's been hurt by another person. Because somehow that means they're the one who hurt them.
</li><li> Unfortunately, lack of enforcement of Good Samaritan laws in China is very widespread, and has given rise to the rather disturbing saying that if you accidentally injure someone (such as Wang Yue above), it's much, <em>much</em> cheaper to just pay for a funeral than escalating medical bills.

Except for the one guy who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">took a picture and left.</a>
</li><li> The example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> above may very well have been based on a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=477835">real incident that occurred in Osaka in 2012 when a madman stabbed two people to death on a busy street.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One of the victims was a music producer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nitroplus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nitroplus">nitro+</a>, which is also the same company that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi">Psycho-Pass's writer</a> works for.
</li><li> A fire alarm going off in a public building, like a school or a hotel, is often met with mild agitation and a very slow meander out of the danger zone, and even that's usually after a few minutes of chatting up the people around you to confirm why the alarm is going off. This is likely a result of either a lack of preparedness (most people don't have a fire plan for any building that's not their own home) or desensitization from fire drills at school or work.
<ul><li> Or because they assumed it was an unannounced drill.
</li><li> The effect actually can be had from any alarm that tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">go off too frequently for other, non-drill causes</a> and in some areas there is an effort to actively avert this by improving the accuracy when it comes to sounding the alarm.
</li></ul></li><li> For the first few months following "Operation: Iraqi Freedom", whenever an Allied aircraft dropped a bomb, everyone in Baghdad ran for cover, and thanked their maker that they hadn't been blown to smithereens. Eventually, the concussive blasts were thought of as if they were lightning strikes, it happened and the people went about their way. If they were away from home, they checked if the dust cloud was rising from their neighborhood. If it wasn't, they ignored it, and continued to do whatever they were doing.
</li><li> The invention of Israel's "Iron Dome" system has resulted in this for a lot of people among the Israeli populace. As it's an interception system for the rockets that are often fired from the neighboring Gaza Strip, and it has a very high success rate, many people react to the warning sirens of incoming rockets with a great deal of calm. This is in direct contrast to the actual military, who proceed to scramble jets to level the area that the rocket came from.
