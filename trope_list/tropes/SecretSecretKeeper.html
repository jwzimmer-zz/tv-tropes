However, there are also "secret" Secret Keepers who figured out the character's secret on their own, and instead of confronting the hero about the secret, decide to keep things quiet. They then almost always take it upon themselves to help the hero secretly from the sidelines by creating distractions to allow the character to slip away to change unnoticed, letting the hero know about dangers or problems that need the hero's attention, and so on.
</p><p>There's usually a given reason for this character to not just tell the hero what they know, from the reasonable to the flimsy. These include them having learnt the information <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulSourceOfKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulSourceOfKnowledge">in a questionable way</a> that could force them to reveal their <em>own</em> secrets, circumstances being that revealing their knowledge could actually make things harder for the good guys, they've decided to wait for the hero to eventually tell them themselves, they're aware that the hero specifically doesn't want <em>them</em> to know the info, self-denial that this information is true, there being no good time to bring it up, or even admitting that they have no reason beyond "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">You Didn't Ask</a>". Regardless, this serves as a good source of drama and comedy, as the hero and those in the loop desperately try to hide the truth from someone who is already perfectly aware of what's going on and is just playing along until the narrative decides to drop an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal">Internal Reveal</a>.

</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Purely Accidental</strong>: They happened to stumble across it, were unintentionally told, or enough coincidences happened that they connected the dots.
</li><li> <strong>Ignored or overlooked third party</strong>: They know because they were there from the beginning, and may have even played a role, but no one noticed.

<ul><li> Isshin knew Ichigo was a Soul Reaper the whole time because he's the Soul Reaper Ichigo inherited that power from.
</li><li> Ichigo found out from Mayuri that Ikkaku possesses Bankai. Ikkaku has no idea that Ichigo knows.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, Sayaka is this when it comes to Touko's more vulnerable side. She's fully aware that Touko isn't as confident as she lets on, as well as more specific details about Touko, like <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySiblingWillLiveOnThroughMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySiblingWillLiveOnThroughMe">her quest to emulate her late sister</a>, but doesn't let on.

Eventually, after Touko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learns the truth about her sister</span>, Sayaka openly reveals how much she knows about Touko.
</li><li> Loki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl">Boku Girl</a></em> knows about Mizuki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a>, but that's because she's the <em>cause</em> of it. As far as Mizuki knows, Loki is a classmate who's seen he's physically female but does not know he started out male.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> OVA, Leon McNichol, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> crossing paths with the Knight Sabers when he's not playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> for Priss, becomes her Secret Secret Keeper in the sixth episode when it's revealed he saw her face when the visor of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">hardsuit</a> broke during the climactic battle of the previous episode.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original anime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sanae accidentally overheard how Yayoi begs Tsubasa to let Misugi's team win since he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy">Ill Boy</a> who is about to be operated on and may not be able to play <em>ever</em> after that. Sanae never reveals this knowledge - and it's not needed since it comes out that same day.</span>
</li><li> In both the <em>Shin</em> OAV's and the manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hyuuga keeps to himself how he walked into Wakabayashi telling Tsubasa that his recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> behavior to the Japanese National Team is fake. When Wakabayashi explains his reasons to the team, Hyuga steps in and reveals that he knew it but said nothing out of respect for him <em>and</em> because it fired him up to try his hardest.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Touya</span> eventually determines that Sakura is having magical adventures (due to his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ability to sense human souls</span>) and, unlike Tomoyo who confronts her about it in the first episode, he keeps the knowledge entirely to himself, reasoning that Sakura must not want others to know if she is going to such effort to keep it a secret. For her part, Sakura assumes he cant possibly know despite Keros suspicions, since she thinks hed tease her relentlessly over it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9">Classi9</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bach and Tchaikovsky</span> either discovered Ren's biological sex or guessed her gender, but kept it to themselves for different reasons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bach</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantSpitItOut">couldn't spit it out</a>, whereas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tchaiko</span> decided to stick with Rentarou because Ren made it clear she referred to herself as a man in front of him.

</li><li> This is downplayed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> series, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she at least suspects Lelouch might be part of the Black Knights, and only Charles erases her memory.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DengekiDaisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DengekiDaisy">Dengeki Daisy</a></em> is an interesting case, due to the fact that the Secret Secret Keeper is the exact person that the secret is supposed to be kept from in the first place.
</li><li> During the Desperate Revival arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, Ran had figured out Conan was Shinichi, but didn't confront him about it because she was waiting for him to tell her. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, she's thrown off once again by the end of the arc and no longer has this role.

<ul><li> The parents of Izzy Izumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> thought that he didn't know he was adopted.

</li><li> Suzie Wong of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is one. As soon as Henry shows that Terriermon is alive, she admits that she knew it all along.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, it's revealed that Bickslow knew all along that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loke was really a Celestial Spirit</span>, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision">Aura Vision</a>.

It's unclear just how much of the secret she knows, though. She seems to enjoy being mysterious about it.
</li><li> Sugi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends">Girl Friends</a></em> is the first, and probably only, one to figure out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mari and Akko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a></span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em>, Gordon goes to see Barbara and asks where Batman is. When she tries to play dumb, he snaps at her "I know, all right? I've always known, I just played my part and let you and Bruce do what needed to be done."
<div class="indent"><strong>Barbara</strong>: When did you... <br/><strong>Gordon</strong>: The first night you went out in the costume with Dick Grayson. <br/><strong>Barbara</strong>: How... <br/><strong>Gordon</strong>: Because I'm a detective, dammit!

White just appreciates the good work and opts never to bring it up. Likewise Clark's best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a> in some versions is aware of his coworker's superhero work.
<ul><li> When Superman reveals himself as Clark Kent in 2020, Jimmy claims he'd known for some time.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jimmy</strong>: I used to think there were only two people in the world who called me "Jim." Then I realized it was only one.
</div></li><li> At least in Pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis</a> continuity, Lois figured it out <em>ages</em> ago but could never prove it (not that she was ever shy about voicing her suspicions, mind you), and for years it was practically a full-time job for Clark/Superman to convince her she was wrong. Years later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllStarSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllStarSuperman">All-Star Superman</a>,</em> we find that he did the job a little <em>too well,</em> so that when he finally reveals his identity to her, she assumes he's just pulling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery">a stupid prank</a> and refuses to believe him.
</li><li> Ditto for Pre-Crisis Lana.
</li><li> Also, the first reaction of Booster Gold is to yell out Clark's name in public, relating that being from the 25th century, he's known all along the secret identities of every major hero and keeping quiet.

</li><li> Pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a> </em>reboot, the Riddler also had figured out Batmans secret after taking a dip in a Lazarus Pit. Batman ultimately convinced him to repress it because if Ras al Ghul found out that he knew and that he was using the Pit, hed kill him. Ras is the father of one of Batmans main love interests and his sons grandfather so he has a personal stake in no one finding out who Batman is as it wouldnt be hard to connect the dots back to him.

<ul><li> In the season 1 finale, Foggy finds Matt venting off steam on a punching bag at Fogwell's Gym. Matt is surprised that Foggy found him here because he's never told Foggy about the gym, prompting Foggy to reveal that he'd known about it from the beginning but didn't say anything out of respect because he was under the impression that Matt's trips to Fogwell's were about the connection the place had with his father and nothing to do with Matt's nighttime outings as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
</li><li> Father Lantom easily figures out that Matt was "the Devil of Hell's Kitchen" from their confessionals, but doesn't say anything until Matt is about to reveal the secret.
</li><li> There's plenty of scenes throughout season 2 where it's strongly implied that Karen Page had suspicions that Matt was Daredevil, but she didn't put together two and two owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion">Matt being blind</a>.
</li><li> While he never says it out loud, it's pretty clear that Frank Castle figures out Matt's secret identity as Daredevil during their interactions at the hospital and during the trial, but he doesn't say a word about it because he just doesn't care about Matt's secret identity. Even if he didn't figure it out then, he definitely would've figured it out by seeing Matt sans-helmet through his rifle scope during the season 2 finale.

At the very least, High Councilor Renier pointedly cut off any questioning of where Mike had been when he suddenly reappeared after having been gone since the second episode, and had been treated as KIA. Keep in mind that he is among the senior crew, along with two others who often, in their eyes, frequently disappear from their stations far too comfortably for any other military setting.

<ul><li> Lois is one of these from the season nine finale until episode five of season 10. During a good portion of season ten (even after he finds out that she knows) there's a hilarious level of Lois trying to hide Clark's identity from characters who already know it, like Chloe and Tess. (Which becomes particularly funny in <em>Patriot</em> where, as below, it becomes pretty clear that the others are just screwing with her.

</li><li> Lois does this earlier with when she finds out Oliver Queen is Green Arrow and tries to keep his secret...from Clark and Chloe. At some points it looks like all three are just screwing with her.
</li><li> Lionel Luthor was one also, having the knowledge both of Clark's abilities and his birth name due to exposure to a Kryptonian artifact. In one episode, he goes out of his way to acquire surveillance footage showing Clark using his abilities (and his watching it without a hint of surprise and with a promise to keep Clark's secret safe serves to inform the audience of his knowledge). He only becomes a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a> after he is trapped in an elevator with Clark's mother, and Clark is forced to rather blatantly use his abilities to save them both.
</li></ul></li><li> A key part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits">Suits</a></em> is Mike hiding the fact he's not really a lawyer from others. Harvey and Donna know from the start and over the course of the series Jessica, Rachel and Louis all find out (as do a couple brief characters). When Mike is finally exposed, Benjamin, the low-level researcher and IT tech at the firm, surprises him by revealing he'd always known for a unique reason: Mike was the only "Harvard grad" who never talked down to Benjamin or rubbed having a law degree in the guy's face.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl</a></em>, Kara learns in the first episode that the DEO has known since she was a kid that she's a Kryptonian and Superman's cousin. She also learns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">James Olsen</a> has known for some time, as Clark had confided him and even told him to watch after her.
<ul><li> An episode has Alex kidnapped and Kara getting a message saying she's Supergirl. It turns out to be a former high school classmate who once saw Kara use her powers to save a bus and figured out the truth. He's now using it to try and force Kara to free his father from prison.
</li><li> In the final scene of the season 2 finale, as Kara races out of a room, Cat Grant smirks "go get 'em, Supergirl," revealing she's known for some time.
</li><li> In a flashback episode, a teenaged Kara and Alex investigate the death of a mutual high school friend. After his killer is caught, they go over the photographs the guy made and find out taken months earlier of Kara flying at night. They realize the boy knew about Kara's identity but kept it quiet because he liked her.
</li><li> Tracking a fugitive Lex Luthor, Kara finds a secret room of photos of her and realizes Lex has known for some time who she is.
</li><li> In the season 4 finale, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being shot</span>, Lex shows Lena evidence of Kara being Supergirl and mocks her on how just about <em>everyone</em> else in Kara's inner circle knew but her.

<ul><li> Also related to Nanase is how many people knew of her lesbianism before she properly came out. Of her seven friends, she goes a long time thinking only two know she's gay. Susan was with her when she realized she was gay, and her reaction to that (activating her fairy doll spell to speak to Elliot and, far as Susan was aware, dropping unconscious) scared Susan, she blabbed it to the two other friends present (Justin &amp; Ellen). Sarah and Grace happened to overhear a conversation during Grace's birthday party. Ultimately, only Tedd remained completely oblivious until Nanase was actually out.
</li><li> Similarly quite a few people figure out that Rhoda and Catalina are a couple, largely due to them both doing an awful job at concealing it. Rhoda actually gets somewhat upset when Diane and Lucy both tell her that they knew about it since the main reason she'd been hiding it was out of concern for how they'd react.

As it turns out, when Charlie finally breaks down and confesses, Jamie reveals that he learned the truth from her mother (who was under the impression that Jamie knew), and he actually suspected something was up from the moment they met.
</li><li> Non-Supers example: Haley and Roy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> have both caught on that Belkar is only faking his alignment shift away from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a>, but have agreed not to call him out for it, preferring how he acts now.

A comment at the beginning of the same chapter may also have been testing the waters as to Heather's superheroing, but this is far less clear.

<ul><li> There are signs as early as his first appearance that the Red Panda's butler, Weston, knows more about the double life his boss leads than he lets on. Weston does things like make sure the Red Panda and Kit have newspapers with the latest superhero or murder related headlines, justifying it by saying he's simply noticed his master's and Kit's preferences. However, when Kit collapses from exhaustion in the manor while still in full Flying Squirrel costume, Weston is not only unsurprised but covers for her with the rest of the staff. From that moment on he's an open and invaluable ally.
</li><li> In the chronological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, "The Final Problem", the Mad Monkey reveals he's known the secret identities of the Red Panda and Flying Squirrel for years. The reason he never acted on that knowledge was he simply didn't <em>care</em> about their secret identities. He's the <em>Red Panda's</em> self proclaimed arch-nemesis, not the arch-nemesis of one of the city's wealthiest men.

<ul><li> Bruce figured out Batgirl was Barbara Gordon at an indeterminate point, but didn't tell her until revealing his own identity. That he also kept this a secret from Dick was the last straw that convinced Dick to leave Batman and become Nightwing.
</li><li> Barbara also later attempts to come out to her father as Batgirl. Before she can state it outright, he heavily implies that he already knows, is proud of her, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">doesn't want to "officially" know</a>.

</li><li> Implied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>. When Terry unmasks himself to reassure a kid he's rescuing, Cobra later tracks the kid down and checks his memories for Batman's true identity. The resulting image is Batman with the head of the kid's action figure, which Terry takes to mean that the kid didn't see his face well and subconsciously replaced the image. As proof, he walks over to the kid's soccer game and mentions to Maxine that he sees the kid everyday, and he hasn't figured it out. The last shot, however, is the kid looking back and giving a knowing smile, implying that he does know but kept it secret.
<ul><li> It's been revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanBeyond">comic adaptation</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dana Tan</span> knew about Terry being Batman before he revealed it.

</li><li> In the early episodes, it was implied that Barbara Gordon already knew that Terry was the new Batman before finally acknowledging it by meeting with Bruce in the Batcave. (Of course, he's the obvious suspect for anyone who knows that Bruce was the original Batman.)

This led to such lines as "You go... somewhere I can't see you and get help!" Danny eventually finds out about her knowing in season two, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext">she sends him a message through time via the Ghost Zone</a>.

Miko regularly allowing Ally to wander their shared bedroom and Miko being a terrible liar who keeps alluding to her real job probably didn't help.

On at least two occasions she has deliberately put her son in a position where he can help people as He-Man.
<div class="indent"><strong>Prince Adam</strong>: I was wondering, when Skeletor had us all chained up, why did you free me instead of one of the others? <br/><strong>Queen Marlena</strong>: Because you are my son, Adam.

<ul><li> Events transpire which require the members of the League who have civilian identities to reveal them to one another. The Flash hems and haws about whether to do this, until Batman sighs and rattles off everyone's supposedly secret civilian names like it ain't no thang.
<div class="indent"><strong>Flash:</strong> Hold on, what about the whole "secret identity" thing?

It's less that she stumbled across his secret and more that his ability to talk to monsters is hereditary and she knew he'd eventually get it from her. She simply doesn't tell Zick this until she is ready to.

A borderline case as Peter has by now been given more hints than he needed to figure that out for himself, but neither of them have gone so far as to say it outright.
