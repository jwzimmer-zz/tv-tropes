<ul><li> A major part of the lead couple's development in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride">The Ancient Magus' Bride</a></em> involves this: Chise Hatori lead such a miserable life due to her powers, she sold <em>herself</em> into slavery as an alternative to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide</a>. She was promptly bought by mage/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> Elias Ainsworth, who declares his intent to marry her - something Chise is completely fine with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">because he was the first person in her entire life to show her any form of kindness</a>, even if it was probably a deception. If that sounds like an incredibly unhealthy relationship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction">that's because it is</a>, and that fact is repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by the rest of the cast (Lindel outright compares it to taming her the way he tames a wild reindeer). In his defense, Elias is an outsider to humanity, and genuinely doesn't seem to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">grasp the moral implications</a> behind his actions, much less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove">his burgeoning feelings for Chise</a>. They're respective character arcs involve her regaining her will to live, and building friendships and connections outside of Elias, while he learns that love is by no means a one-way street, and to be more open and less possessive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nami/Sanji. Nami likes to bend people to her will. Sanji won't say no to a girl. You take it from there. Most of the time it ends up fetishized.
</li><li> Also in fanon, the domineering Smoker and his subordinate/protegee Tashigi. (Though in canon, it's probably more of a father/daughter or teacher/student relationship.)
</li><li> And Luffy/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">Hancock</a>, but not in the way you'd normally expect looking at their age differences. She's canonically hopelessly in love with him and would do anything he'd ask (on top of believing they're already in a relationship), while he sees her as a friend who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">helps him rescue his older brother</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> features several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> examples of those, such as Kaho/Touya, Terada/Rika, and Clow/Yue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> has Hayate/Vita. They hit this trope more than once, and both ways. In one direction, it's a case of master/knight (within their personal sub-group) <em>and</em> superior/subordinate officer (within the military they joined). In the other direction, Hayate is 9 years old (25 by the fourth season), while Vita <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">has been around for centuries (but looks young enough to be a first-grader</a>). At some point during Chrono and Amy's relationship, Chrono was captain of the same ship Amy was serving on, but by the time they get married, Amy has retired from the TSAB.
</li><li> Kazuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> is most frequently shipped with such characters. Just about everyone in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> is slavishly devoted to him and acts like he left them at the altar when they reappear in the story proper. Juubei, Toshiki, and Saizou were all his subordinates in their gang, Fuuga—which was started mainly as a way to gather protection around him. More specifically, the family of his childhood friend Juubei has been allied to Kazuki's since time immemorial, and the male heirs of their families are traditionally a lord and his physician. Plus there's Ren, a thirteen-year-old girl who admires twenty-year-old Kazuki as he was a high-ranking member of the VOLTS gang, and just that charismatic when she actually met him face to face. Sakura, Juubei's sister, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> who turns Fuuga into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>, is probably the only one who doesn't act madly in love with him—and it was she who noted that no matter what happens, they will always be bound to Kazuki and always be there to protect him. For his part, Kazuki cherishes them all and repeatedly refuses to accept it when the thin line between love and hate turns them against him, or each other.
</li><li> It is telling that pairing a 22-year-old Noblewoman with the 69-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a> that more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">raised her after her dad died a decade ago</a> is among the least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay">creepy</a> 'ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> fandom.
<ul><li> A particularly egregious example is that of Alucard/Seras. This is mostly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a> of the Gonzo anime, which was an attempt to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Alucard</a> a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments.
</li><li> And Alucard/Integra too - although the fact that he's her servant is somewhat offset by his age, power, and willful personality (not that his master lacks in the latter department...)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> While Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye know each other from childhood, the fact is that he's a few ranks her superior in the current story. She calls him "Sir" or "Colonel". He calls her "Lieutenant". The fact that the military has anti-fraternization laws is brought up a few times and implied to be the main reason they're not together. It's hinted that they're eventually going to get married when Mustang completes his goals and Hawkeye retires from the military.
</li><li> There's also Ling and Lan Fan, who are possibly even more unequal, with Ling being the twelfth prince of Xing and Lan Fan being his bodyguard, and from a family that has served his for generations. Ling doesn't really seem to care about the differences in rank, while Lan Fan appears to be very dedicated to her duty; naturally, fans treat this approximately the same way a person dying of thirst might treat a glass of water.
</li><li> Then there are Roy/Ed shippers. While the difference in their ranks is not as great as with Roy and Riza (since all State Alchemists start out as Majors, and Ed usually doesn't give a damn about rank anyway), Ed's age adds to the inequality.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's Suzaku/Euphemia (canon), Schneizel/Kanon (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPunIntended" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPunIntended">canon</a>), and Charles and Marianne (canon - really, all of the Emperor's consorts would count as this, but Marianne is said to be the only one he truly loved).

The most notable (and most canon) example is Shiro/Kuroh. Shiro is quite uncomfortable with Kuroh kneeling to him and calling him King, but he learns to deal with it. Theirs is also a rather informal Clan, and Kuroh isn't afraid to lecture Shiro and make him be more responsible, but even so, Shiro is still the King.

Fan pairings of Sousuke with basically anyone else from Mithril, such as Commander Andrei Kalinin and Lieutenant Benjamin Clouseau, are subject to the same inequality.
</li><li> There's also Melissa Mao and Kurz Weber; the less dramatic inequality in their ranks is made more significant by the fact that Mao is Sousuke and Kurz's team leader - a fact which Kurz mostly ignores and which isn't really addressed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since Kurz is killed in action not long after the two of them begin their relationship</span>.

In some fanfics, the common application for the trope is <em>inverted</em>, with Neji becoming head of the clan and Hinata being demoted to the branch family.

To explain, Agon enjoys nothing more than exerting power and superiority over others and in general, is quite sadistic. Unsui, the kinder but weaker twin, wants his brother to live to his full potential and be the best. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">flanderized</a> in the anime, where Agon is made even more violent and Unsui flat-out states he only exists to serve his brother.

Kaiba's also much smarter and a better duelist than Jonouchi. Adding it all up, it basically means that Jonouchi would be Kaiba's bitch, whether he likes it or not - several fanfics actually have it that Jonouchi lives in Kaiba's mansion, which further adds to the unfairness of the ship as it makes Kaiba his landlord as well. A lot of fans fetishize this, giving them a VERY unequal Master-Servant style relationship.

The Special Editions of <em>SEED Destiny</em> show that Lacus becomes the leader of PLANT at the end of the series (the role Athrun's father formerly held), with Kira becoming the head of the PLANT military and thus her subordinate. As such, breaking up Athrun and Cagalli is widely seen as the result of a feud between the lead writer and Cagalli's voice actress.

Most of Lux's love interests are nobles or outright royalty (Philuffy is an exception, and even she's from an extremely wealthy family). Lux himself is technically royalty, but of a fallen empire, and he's saddled with a huge debt on top of that. Initially, the only love interest to have similar status to him was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">his younger sister Airi</a>. As the series goes on, Lux's status increases, first when he becomes Lisha's official knight (though this still makes him unequal with her) and later when he becomes one of the Seven Dragon Paladins (who have privileges arguably greater than most nobles), so the trope starts swinging in the other direction.

The magically-bound-slave problem can be removed, but then Oreg is more powerful and older than Ward. As both of them are very nice people, who would never use their strength against one another, the power difference is easily ignored.

Vincent is an adult far older than he looks and is far stronger in both strength and skill while Cloud is a teenage newbie player. On the other hand, Cloud is advantaged in that he technically <em>owns</em> Vincent due to the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">becoming his pet</a> to protect and hide him from the countless other players out to kill him. Also Cloud is the reason that Vincent gets any humane treatment as he was the first to realize that Vincent was a person and not a monster or glitch as believed. Although Cloud would never exploit Vincent and both are very respectful of each other's boundaries.

They treat each other as equals but Elsa is still the queen of the country while Freya works for her. Freya keeps her distance from Elsa in order to keep their relationship secret (though that is more because Freya is a woman rather than because of her social status). Later Freya gets upgraded to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elsa's bodyguard</span> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an injury leaves her unable to lift her arm</span> but that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">isn't much better</a>.

On the other hand, he's a Noble and she's a Number, placing him two or three social classes above her (if not more, given that he's secretly a Prince), she's nominally hired help working for the Ashford family (and by extension him) who doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">his bodyguard</a>, and things get exponentially more one-sided after Sayoko swears fealty to Lelouch. The latter not only made her his liege-woman and he her lord, but the specific oath she willingly swore also serves as an unequal wedding vow of sorts not too different from that of a concubine. Finally, much of the development of their relationship after getting together revolves around Lelouch coming to accept that Sayoko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropertyOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropertyOfLove">considers herself truly his</a> and on how they build a healthy romantic relationship and a working professional one from that fact.

Inko was a secretary for the HR department. Hisashi was the CEO of the company she worked for and was the one to hire her. When he disappears without telling her why, Inko had no means to protect herself or their young son since she had quit her job to raise Midoriya. She is basically trapped in a marriage with a distant, uncontactable husband who still pays for all the living expenses and she can't divorce him because she can't financially support herself due to being out of the workforce for quite some time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EightCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EightCount">Eight Count</a></em>, Dr. Pamela Isley is a drug testing technician for a boxing league and has a sexual relationship with two of the league's boxers. This obviously creates a conflict of interest, especially since one of the fighters is a rookie.
</li><li> A number of fics in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> fandom ship Roy/Ed while basically ignoring the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">incredibly creepy</a></em> implications of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades">adult military officer</a> dating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">fifteen year old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingWithTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingWithTheBoss">subordinate</a>. Even if one considers Ed an adult in terms of consent (fifteen is at least <em>possible</em>, and Ed operates with the freedom of an adult even if other characters consider him a child), he's been working for Mustang since age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">twelve</a></em>. AU stories that ship them tend to put their relationship on much more equal footing. Royai fics (Mustang/Hawkeye) also tend to ignore the power dynamics (he's Hawkeye's superior officer, too) while simply focusing on the obstacle of fraternization laws. This is more forgivable however, as they're both mature adults who have known each other for years and deeply respect and rely on each other, so power abuse and/or emotional manipulation is less likely.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em> is the most powerful fairy, so there is no one who is really her equal, even among the other fairies. Most of the fandom (and it is heavily implied in the movie) ships her with Diaval who is actually only a raven, whom she turned into a human. He's also her servant, as he owes her his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmericanPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmericanPresident">The American President</a></em> makes one of these its main plot, exploring it from several different angles. As you might guess, one participant is the President, and the other is an ordinary woman of no special fame or fortune.
</li><li> A sizable chunk of the fandom for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010">Alice in Wonderland (2010)</a></em> ships the Mad Hatter with the White Queen, rather than Alice. Bear in mind that these two characters <em>never actually speak to each other onscreen</em> in the movie. They point out that the two have known each other for a long time (he had been her court hatter), they're the only ones who survived the Horunvendush Day attack, and they are staunch allies even if they're not shown talking. They're also the same species, which helps.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a></em>, Jareth/Sarah is massively popular. Leaving aside the age difference (she's a teenager while he's physically an adult and, as the Goblin King, almost certainly MUCH older than he looks), he's a king and can use his power to change the land. The ending of the movie does have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah proving his equal by declaring that her will is as strong as his and "[her] kingdom as great", finishing by stating that he has no power over her and making her return her and her brother home.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> has many popular ships of the teacher/student kinds, with Snape/Hermione and Snape/Harry as their most popular. In the fandom, these are referred to as "cross-generational pairings." Many of them make fans quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicked</a>. There's also Voldemort and Bellatrix, his "most faithful" servant who's also nearly thirty years younger than him, though Voldemort doesn't see her as anything other than a pawn. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild">They do have a daughter together</a>, giving this one some canonicity.</span>
</li><li> A non-fanon example occurs in David Edding's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Durnik's death</span>, Polgara announces that she loves him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mpma');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mpma" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mpma');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">note that it has been obvious from page one that Durnik is deeply in love with her and has been for years, long before he knew she was an ageless sorceress who'd shaped world history</span>. However, while Aldur helps him return, he informs Polgara that the fact that she's a sorceress and Durnik's not would doom their relationship. She agrees to "become his equal" as the price for his return, and for several weeks believes that she's lost her powers — but as it turned out, she didn't. Instead, Durnik had been given power to match hers.
<ul><li> It is also set up and then <em>thoroughly</em> averted with Garion and Ce'Nedra. King Garion is the ruler of Riva and Overlord of the West, as well as being an immortal sorcerer and the designated custodian of a cosmically powerful artifact <em>that can smack down the gods</em>. Princess Ce'Nedra is, outside of a couple extra centuries' of life expectancy via the Dryad side of her family, entirely mortal. Given that under Alorn law, the queen's role is limited to bearing the heirs and being royal chatelaine, this could easily have been one of the most lopsided power dynamics ever seen in a relationship. Fortunately, Garion takes one look at the situation, realizes that keeping Ce'Nedra in that unequal a situation would either crush her spirit or drive her to regicide, and hurriedly writes a "The queen shall hold powers making her co-ruler to the king and regent of the realm in his absence" into the marriage contract, and then puts it into law.
</li><li> Also employed in canon in <em>The Elenium</em>, when twentysomething Queen Ehlana marries her middle-aged former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">bodyguard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">surrogate parental figure</a> Sparhawk. This trope concerns Sparhawk a good deal, but he eventually goes along with it. Perhaps the age gap and the authority gap (between sovereign and knight) cancel each other out.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Aes Sedai from the Green Ajah</a> are notorious for having relationships with their Warders. Even weirder, Aes Sedai can actually mind control their Warders, though it is considered a bit unethical.
<ul><li> The real taboo seems to be bonding someone against their will in the first place. The assumption seems to be that once you've agreed to be bonded, you have only yourself to blame.
</li><li> Most relationships in the setting, really, due to the various odd ways the various societies deal with the unusual relevance of gender. In the case of the Sea Folk, who live pretty much entirely on ships with a rigid and extensive hierarchy, it's practically impossible to have relationships not fitting this trope - and they actually make a rule of marriage that the lower-ranked person is in charge in all private matters. A main character discovers this after marrying in one of their ceremonies (she was in a hurry to get married and they were there). Unsurprisingly for the series, she decides she's fine with it.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting canonical example between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> and Amberley Vail: he's a renowned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">Political Officer</a> who exists outside the normal military structure, while she's part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> with the authority to requisition just about anything, or even kill planets. While Cain seems to genuinely love Amberley, he's <em>well</em> aware that he can't say no to her, which ends with him getting dragged into all sorts of nastiness time and again. But he admits that "looking back, I have to say she made it well worth the effort."
<ul><li> Another example from the same series would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sgt. Grifen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Trooper Magot</a>, who are in the same squad but still a couple.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">Hamish Alexander</a>. Forty years her senior and consistently outranking her, Ham always was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">mentor and authority figure</a> for Honor, even before they hit it off. Somewhat subverted by the fact that they were acutely aware of the consequences (Hamish was, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll">and still is</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, after all!), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">almost worked themselves into nervous breakdowns</a> (and Honor was taken prisoner and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">presumed dead</a> for several years) trying to pretend that nothing happened at all, and overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earned Their Happy Ending</a>.
<ul><li> Also, Hamish and Honor did not actually start dating until after Honor's promotion to fleet admiral, which put the final nail in their former mentor/protege relationship and made them professional equals. At present, Hamish is again her nominal superior as First Lord of the Admiralty, but if the Judge Advocate General of the RMN (who was <em>actually consulted</em>) says that their current relationship doesn't violate regs, then it doesn't. Lastly, being 40 years older than someone is less of a gap in a society where the average life expectancy is 250-300 years.
</li><li> Manticoran regulations say that relationships between different members of the armed services are permissible so long as the people involved aren't in the same chain of command (Thus Honor's relationship with Paul Tankersley, who was one rank junior to her, was acceptable because he was not a member of her crew. If he had been posted to <em>Nike</em> rather than Hancock Station, it would have been a different matter). While being First Lord of the Admiralty (Civilian head of the Navy) made Hamish technically the head of the chain of command to <em>everyone</em> in the Navy, he had to resign his commission to accept the job. The JAG ruling basically stated that since Hamish was no longer a serving Naval Officer, the fraternization reg did not apply.

<ul><li> Daenerys Targaryen was married off to Khal Drogo for political reasons when she was a destitute, powerless, friendless 13-year-old princess and he was an extremely powerful, feared, 30-something warlord with 50,000 men at his back. Once Dany gained power in her own right, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">relationship</a> with her handmaidens became this, as they are her slaves. The shippers love these ships, especially the former.
</li><li> The shippers also like Sansa/almost every male character, which is basically a guaranteed Unequal pairing; Sansa has almost no power behind her, aside from being the first daughter of a prestigious family, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she loses that in the first book when her father is executed for being a traitor.</span> Awareness of the inequality in their relationship leads <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyrion</span> to leave it unconsummated, and though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Littlefinger</span> is similarly aware, this may not stop him, as he appears to view Sansa as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a surrogate for her mother.

</li><li> There's also the popular Jaime/Brienne pairing, which can be cut both ways—Jaime is older, more experienced, and a scion of the wealthiest and most powerful family in Westeros and finds it easy to fluster Brienne, but Brienne is larger, stronger (a fight between them would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">no contest</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Jaime loses his sword hand</span>) and likes to call Jaime out on his crap.

For good measure, it's not uncommon to add employer/employee dynamics or major differences in age and/or sexual experience. The heroine then proves to the hero by virtue of her smarts and personality that she is actually more his equal than the women of his social class.

Adolin and Shallan have entered into an arranged marriage. He's one of the most powerful men on the planet and is third in line for the throne of the most powerful country. She, on the other hand, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">Country Mouse</a> who was barely noble <em>before</em> her house started having horrific money problems. Not too much attention is given to it, but it is noted that he could make her do anything (even something as simple as staying with the guards where she's safe) due to their relative positions. Luckily, he's far too nice a guy to take advantage. At the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his position is the same, but she's now one of the founding members of the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Knights Radiant</a>, making her in charge of leading the whole world against demons, and giving her magic strong enough that she could theoretically beat him in a fight.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels Captain Carrot and Lance-Constable Angua (later Sergeant Angua) qualify, although Carrot is too nice to hold his rank over <em>anyone</em> if he can avoid doing so, and the cynical and sarcastic Angua is generally taking the lead in the relationship. And as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IShallWearMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IShallWearMidnight">I Shall Wear Midnight</a></em>, Angua has been promoted to captain as well, so it's no longer an issue at all. Far more uncomfortable than the actual rank, however, is Angua's observation that "I'm a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">wolf</a> who lives among humans, and there's a word for that.

</li><li> This is a big part of the romance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>. Jane is a poor governess who falls in love with her employer. The two eventually are set to marry, but it's called off because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's already married</span>. Still, it's hinted that their marriage wouldn't have been happy because of the power imbalance <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and they're able to make things work after she inherits a respectable amount of money and he is injured in a house fire</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>, Bella is a clumsy middle-class teenager who's prone to bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">life-threatening stupidity</a>. Her boyfriend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventual husband</span> is a 108-year-old vampire who is physically, mentally, and financially superior to her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush">Hush, Hush</a></em>, Nora's relationship with Patch is considerably unequal since he can use his powers to make her hallucinate anything he wants. In the first book, he uses this power to make her hear voice, not notice him stalking her, and prevent at least one authority figure from taking her request to separate her from him seriously. While he seems to not use those powers after they hook up, he still has them and it's really only his word that he isn't. He also can't feel pain and doesn't seem to be killable in any normal way, so fighting him off is nearly impossible.
</li><li> The relationship between Anastasia Steel and Christian Grey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>. Christian is obscenely wealthy and has an army of bodyguards, hackers, and investigators on his payroll, all of which he has no problem using to dig up all of Ana's information and keep tabs on her. He also uses his money for the technology to track her via her cellphone and to buy the company she works at so he can give her promotions she hasn't earned. Ana herself is incredibly naive, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>, a recent college graduate, and <em>very</em> sexually inexperienced.
</li><li> This is quite common among the Sea Folk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> and as such is incorporated into their marriage vows. According to their vows, whichever member of the couple commands in public must obey in private. The assumption is that all marriages are an unequal pairing, but by switching which way around the inequality is in public and private a balance is maintained.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> this is the main source of tension in Alec Lightwood and Magnus Bane's relationship. Alec is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">Shadowhunter</a> in his late-teens who is rather reserved, insecure about his homosexuality and has never been in a relationship. Magnus is a 400+-year-old warlock with immense magical powers, is not getting any older physically-speaking, has had innumerable relationships over the centuries, and is very secretive about himself even though he knows virtually everything about Alec. Initially, Magnus pretty much dictates all of the terms of their relationship and it causes a lot of problems. They get over it, and the relationship starts to become better balanced as it progresses in later books in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmaranthineSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmaranthineSaga">Tsumiko and the Enslaved Fox</a></em>, despite falling in love with Argent, who is magically bound to her, Tsumiko refuses to accept a relationship with him until she has secured his freedom, as any relationship between them with the bond intact could never truly be equal. On a series-wide level, the powerful nature of the Amaranthine makes it hard to avoid this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a>, but the series typically handles it by giving the human characters powerful Reaver abilities, or, in Kimiko's case, deliberately framing the relationship so that she has the majority of the agency.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> has an example in Pinestar and Leopardfoot: Pinestar is the leader of ThunderClan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives">on his second-to-last life</a>, while Leopardfoot is a young, newly made warrior. While in the books the only real thing that characters comment on is that Pinestar doesn't seem to have any interest in their kits, the fandom tends to dislike the pairing due to the age gap and notable power imbalance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reaper2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reaper2016">Reaper (2016)</a></em>: Jex and Michael/ Hawk. He's the most-visible and universally loved Founder Player, who's lived in Game for four hundred years and done pretty much <em>everything</em>. Jex, opposed on principle to relationships where she can't be an equal partner, is reluctant to begin a relationship with him for this reason; for one thing, she's hero-worshipped him for years and has his poster on her wall. Hawk defrosting himself so she can meet the <em>real</em> him and see that, on a personal level, they're really not so unequal helps. As does Jex being made an honorary Founder Member for her part in preventing the bombing of the Celestius server.

It was always a bit weird how Lex had no friends his own age and chose to hang around high-schoolers all the time—he even made 16-year-old Clark his best man—but this relationship seemed especially awkward given his lengthy sexual history, which included a couple of rich heiresses.

Raikov appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Bishounen</a> with occasional violent tendencies and a penchant for scanty underwear.

A slightly skeevier example also comes in the form of Big Boss and Paz, in which he is roughly 38 and believes Paz to be a <em>sixteen-year-old schoolgirl</em> - despite this, the player can still complete the "Date with Paz" mission and (it is implied) have sex with her.

Given Kojuro's insane loyalty and the retainer-lord obligations of the time, the power imbalance would be mind-boggling, except Kojuro is ten years older than Masamune, personally responsible for most of the army's strategy that isn't limited to "charge into battle screaming in Engrish and do crazy shit" and has, in both anime and video game canon, kicked his lord's ass, <em>hard</em>, when Masamune was being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight">suicidally stupid</a> (although both times afterward he tried to kill himself for having raised his blade to Masamune. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan">That didn't go over well</a>).

The Trooper and the Imperial Agent also have at least one love interest who is a lower-ranked member of their squad.
</li><li> Just about any pairing involving Shepard in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series, because of the fact that (s)he's the captain of the <em>Normandy</em> and all of the squad members are his/her subordinates, but especially Shepard/Ashley and Shepard/Kaidan; all three of them are in the Alliance navy and Shepard outranks both Ash and Kaidan. As Shepard points out, though, what with the Saren and the Reapers and all, being caught fraternizing is the <em>least</em> of their problems.
<ul><li> Ashley touches on this trope in an e-mail to one of her sisters, says that she would never get together with one of her subordinates because if she has to decide who lives and who dies, she doesn't want love to factor into her decision. This becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> when you consider that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on Virmire, Shepard has to choose between her and Kaidan, both of whom can be romanced. Ashley can, depending on the player's choices, be sacrificed for a romanced Kaidan or saved because Shepard is in a romance with her.</span>.
</li><li> Even the romance options who are not <em>technically</em> subordinates (having volunteered to help out and being outside the military chain of command,) have this to some extent; even those with strong and independent personalities who could easily be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Hero of Another Story</a> tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">very much in Shepard's shadow</a>, never question Shepard's leadership for a moment, and (even if they disapprove,) inevitably go along with any decision Shepard makes.
<ul><li> Though there are <em>some</em> exceptions; Tali, for example, will break off her relationship with Shepard if he chooses to side with Legion over her in their argument. Even though her loyalty can be regained with a Charm check later, the romance cannot be restarted. It can only be continued if Shepard either uses the Charm/Intimidate option or sides with her during the argument. Additionally, the romance cannot even be started to begin with if Shepard makes a choice she disapproves of to resolve her loyalty mission; it must be resolved in a way she agrees with, preferably by getting her exonerated <em>without</em> showing the evidence she tells you to bury.
</li></ul></li><li> Technically speaking, several of the relationships would be an Unequal pairing in the other direction <em>if</em> Shepard and their romantic partner were part of the same chain of command (which they're not; Shepard doesn't even fall under the Alliance's chain per se, being a Spectre and all). Shepard is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness">Commander</a>. Kaidan in the third game is a Major (considered in the fictional ranking system to be higher than Commander), Garrus seems to be a general (or at least high enough that a low-ranking general salutes <em>him</em>), and Tali is an <em>admiral.</em> Their ranks aren't just for show either. Shepard spends most of the third game shooting people on ground missions, while occasionally ending up in scenarios where s/he can alter world-changing events with the push of a button, by sheer chance. While they go on ground missions and shoot enemies as well, Tali and Garrus also spend their spare time helping to direct the grand war strategies of their respective species; Garrus is a personal adviser to the Primarch, while Tali can be seen on the Citadel organizing the evacuation of allied colonies and bolstering of allied defense lines.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> has the interesting variation of the pairing becoming more uneven over the three acts of the game. At the start, Hawke is a penniless refugee doing quests to get enough money to give their family a chance to start a new life. From there Hawke reclaims the family estate inherited from their noble grandparents, becomes wealthy, becomes the Champion of the city for saving from Qunari invasion, and eventually has so much political influence that their actions will go down in history during the final conflict. Meanwhile, Hawke's love interests are a runaway slave who joins you in case his master comes after him, an apostate mage lying low in the slums, a Dalish elf shunned from her clan, and a pirate in debt to slavers. Sebastian breaks the mold by being an exiled prince but even by the end of the game, he's somewhat above Hawke, especially if he goes back to retake the throne.
<ul><li> Fenris, the runaway slave, is the love interest who acknowledges this the most by pointing out that Hawke surely has better suitors than an elven slave. This makes sense as his backstory is being the bodyguard and sex slave of an extremely powerful Tevinter magister who wiped his memory, making it the biggest unbalanced pairing possible (and even more so if Hawke is a mage).

That said, it's possible to start flirting with them before officially becoming the Inquisition's leader.
<ul><li> Solas is an interesting variant given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is secretly Fen'Harel, the trickster god of elven legend. While his <em>vastly</em> superior age, immortality, life experience gives him undue power over a female elf Inquisitor, she <em>is</em> the head of a vast religious military organization that could lock him up at her behest. However, throughout the game, she doesn't know his true identity, and he is very weakened from his millennia-long slumber and posing as one of her subordinates. However, after the end credits Solas absorbs the power of another elven god, and gains not only the magical strength to turn whole armies to stone with a <em>thought</em>, but a vast elven and eluvian spy network to cripple nations. However, Lavellan still has a lot of clout as the Herald of Andraste, and a big enough team of followers to stand up to him.</span>

</li><li> Canonically occurs twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> (2003), first between Karai, second-in-command (and later, head) of the Foot Clan, and Dr. Chaplin, the company's head scientist; and, to a lesser extent, between Starlee Hambrath—a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> interning for O'Neil Tech — and Cody Jones, O'Neil Tech's owner.
</li><li> Most pairings involving Megatron and his subordinates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> involve this. A bit less so with Optimus Prime, but the power difference is still there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> (technically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>) gave us Batman/Batgirl. It's long over by the time we and Terry learn of it. His reaction can be summed up as "Wait, what? Whoa". Nightwing's was worse, as he appeared to cut off all ties with <strong>both</strong> of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> The common Zhao/Azula <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">Crack Pairing</a> takes this from two angles. On one hand, we have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">middle-aged man and a fourteen-year-old girl</a>; on the other, we have a naval officer with more ego than sense and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain">favorite</a> (as well as freakishly skilled and terrifyingly cunning) daughter.
</li><li> There's also Azula/Ty-Lee and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">Azula/Suki</a>.
</li><li> Aang and Katara can count but the level to which this applies as well as who has the more power can vary. As the Avatar and the last Airbender, by definition, no one is Aang's equal, but on the other hand, Katara was the last waterbender of the South Pole and becomes one of the greatest in the world, even becoming Aang's mentor. This actually factors into the power imbalance on her side because she not only becomes Aang's sifu but also acts as a Parental Substitute, or she at least tries to. How much Aang takes to her attempts is uncertain but when it comes to disagreements, Katara is the one who tends to have the final word.
</li></ul></li><li> A common pairing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> is Vlad/Danny. Vlad is literally old enough to be Danny's dad (Vlad and Jack went to college together). In canon, he actually wants to make Danny his son, which is kinda creepy. And then you have Vlad's general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>-ness. This one is fetishized to the point that rapefic is practically the norm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fandom has the relatively common shipping of Princess Celestia, a thousand plus year old immortal who controls the rising and setting of the Sun and is the unquestioned diarch of Equestria, with Twilight Sparkle, who is (aside from magical prowess) a relatively normal unicorn mare who is her student—and somewhat socially naive, to boot. Other fanfics ship Celestia's sister Luna (also immortal, though due to a thousand years of imprisonment in magical stasis in the moon, her "real" age is difficult to determine) with Twilight Sparkle, Trixie, or Fluttershy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thanks to Twilight ascending to alicorn-hood</span>, the first pairing is now more equal, but Twilight would still be the far less powerful of the pair, at least socially. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At least until the finale, when Celestia retires and Twilight takes her place as ruler of Equestria.</span> In several fanfics, Celestia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outright ascended Twilight</span> because she loved her and wanted her to be with her without social issues (plus she didn't want Twilight to die).
</li><li> The <em>Friendship is Magic</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">comicsverse</a> has issue #9, where Princess Luna gets quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Big Macintosh, Applejack's older brother.
</li><li> There's even a canon example of this in Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. She's a princess and effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess">Love Goddess</a>, and he's the Captain of the Royal Guard.
</li></ul></li><li> A common pairing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> is Numbuh 1 and Numbuh 362. While Numbuh 1 is a sector leader and holds a good chunk of power in his own right, Numbuh 362 is the leader of the entire Kids Next Door, meaning everyone anwsers to her.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The US Armed Forces actually have regulations in place to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">prevent</a> this sort of thing (particularly between enlisted personnel and officers) which even extends to spouses and children.
</li><li> Similarly, the Canadian Armed Forces prohibits any member from having a relationship with another member within their chain of command. Junior/Senior relationships and even Officer/NCM relationships are acceptable, so long as they aren't within the same chain of command.
</li><li> Any relationship between a slave and their slaveowner will qualify as this. There have been times where the slaveowner in question actually set their slave free after falling in love with them, but sometimes not.
</li><li> The morganatic marriage system came into being because of such pairings being royal men and lesser-ranking women. This system primarily existed in German-speaking regions of Europe but was sometimes implemented elsewhere when deemed necessary by the royal families and/or parliaments when a royal insisted on marrying someone of lower rank. In such a marriage, the children will be considered legitimate but not eligible to inherit the throne. It specifically did <em>not</em> exist in Britain, where the only legal issue of a royal marrying a commoner was whether the current monarch would approve of the pairing. Meaning that if it's the current monarch him/herself getting married, they can marry anybody they bloody well please.
</li><li> Famously, Bill Clinton and "that woman" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43q30');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43q30" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43q30');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No, not Hillary!</span> . Of course, it may depend on what his lawyer can argue the definition of "pairing" is.
</li><li> A massive problem in prisons, with both inmate-inmate and guard-inmate relationships being strictly forbidden due to the potential for abuse. A guard caught engaging in sexual conduct with an inmate can face life in prison.
</li><li> Professionals are often forbidden by the ethics of their profession from pursuing a romantic or physical relationship with their clients and patients.
<ul><li> In medical ethics, it is considered unethical to ever engage in any romantic affair with a patient. It is even unethical to say, "Sorry, not while you are my patient," because this may make a patient decide not to seek medical care in order to pursue a romance. The only allowed answer is "No."
</li></ul></li><li> Many universities prohibit teacher-student relationships because of this, even if most university students are legal adults. This is mostly because even if there's significantly lessened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> about statutory rape, the ethical issues of giving your student higher grades for "favors" are still <em>very much</em> true.
