</p><p>Wolves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox">Foxes</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts">Lions</a> and other big cats can be heroes as well because their babies are cute and thus remind people of puppies and kittens, and the adults look badass.

And if you'll encounter an Antlion in the role of horrible predator, its <em>adult</em> form is <em>not</em> likely to appear in next scenes (it looks like a cute, pretty dragonfly). For any animals not in this short list, it's usually divided into one of these.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> Ugly - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatorsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredatorsAreMean">Predatory</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengersAreScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengersAreScum">Scavenging</a> - Parasitic - Mean

</li><li> Cool - Brave - Predatory - Badass - Heroic
</li></ul><p>Some fiction goes even further, casting only cute, cuddly, and cool animals - ugly and unpopular animals tend to be non anthropomorphic, villainous, or outright absent.
</p><p>It should be noted that which animals get to be considered cute/cool or the opposite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">tends to vary by culture</a>. For example, foxes are generally cute or roguish in America, mean in some parts of Europe and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> types in others, magical tricksters in Japan, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> evil in Korea. Rats are portrayed as vermin in the western world, but are revered in India and is the first of twelve animals that represent the years on the Chinese Zodiac. Pigs are often outrightly dirty and greedy in western culture, but tend to get more consideration in China, where they are part of the aforementioned Zodiac as well.
</p><p>Another factor may be the animal's size and/or place in human society. For example, both Mice and Rats can be cute, but they can get a bad rap because they're commonly household pests. Even then, the tiny Mice are likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMice">to be portrayed more positively</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">than the larger Rats</a>. Consequently; if a cat is chasing a mouse, the cat is often portrayed as the villain, but a cat chasing a <em>rat</em> is usually the hero.
</p><p>Whatever the case may be, if you happen to think any of the animals in the "Designated Villains" list <em>are</em> cute and/or cool, you are a weirdo in the eyes of the mainstream.
</p><p>It is worth noting that there are some exceptions to this rule, because perceived slyness and/or cunning are often important determining factors along with cuteness. Rats and ferrets, for example, are almost always portrayed as mean and/or evil, even though they are small and fuzzy. However, mice, who appear nice or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">mostly harmless</a> quite a bit, are commonly thought to be unable to think their way out of a wet paper bag. For this reason, though cats are indisputably adorable, they are often seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">mean</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandCat">villain's pet</a>.
</p><p>This trope is pervasive enough that simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">associating a human character with a certain animal</a> or, in fantasy and science fiction, giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">the features of an animal</a> can immediately peg them as good or bad.
</p><p>In extreme cases, this can start to look like the animal equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. Where are the wise crows (the closest you get is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleverCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleverCrows">Clever Crows</a>), easygoing iguanas, mean, aggressive hippos, gentle gorillas (though these are more common in the 21st century than any time period before the 1990s), murderous doves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> chimpanzees, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">bullying swans</a>, suicidal deer, vicious, sociopathic dolphins (though this is becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeviousDolphins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeviousDolphins">popular in recent years</a>), ad infinitum?
</p><p>This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> and a major problem in wildlife preservation, with animals that appeal to humans termed <em>charismatic megafauna</em>, like the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/VEMtc1w4z6c">panda<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for example. It doesn't matter if, like the aforementioned Coelacanth, you've survived damn near everything else the world can throw at you; if you aren't generally thought of as cute by most people, you're in serious trouble. Few people really care about ugly or unpopular animals, regardless of their ecological importance.
</p><p>The Coelacanth example can also lead us towards the subtrope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehistoricMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrehistoricMonster">Prehistoric Monster</a>, about the whole <em>extinct</em> animal ensemble, which often receives in media the same treatment as modern-day "non-cutes" or even worse.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> is somewhat related, as it was born from the scientific study of this trope.

This trope also applies to humans and is often the deciding factor of who gets to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Face of the Band</a>. This trope is pervasive enough that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Killer Rabbit</a> and some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">Bad Kitties</a> exist to subvert it. Time period and location seem to affect public opinion of mustelids, as shown by the contrasting tropes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselMascot">Weasel Mascot</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWeasel">Wicked Weasel</a>.
</p><p>One way to subvert audience expectations with this trope is to turn the moralities of the characters on their head, but not the characteristics of the animals themselves. For example, use animals normally seen as unpopular (such as horseshoe crabs), and retain their "undesirable" qualities while showing that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersGoodPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersGoodPeople">good at heart</a>. Conversely, use popular animals (like dogs) to display pleasurable features, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">while hiding their malevolent nature</a>.
</p><p>Incidentally, we are very happy to report that since this trope was launched, it turns out that many Tropers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool">have a soft spot for unpopular creatures</a>.

<ul><li> In what was probably a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing">Viral Marketing</a> campaign, Ford "accidentally" leaked two SportKa ads onto the Internet. One depicted a pigeon getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">smacked by the car's hood</a> before taking a crap on it, and the other depicted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">cat getting decapitated</a> by the car's sun roof. While both sparked complaints, the cat one was the worst-received, though it might mostly be the level of violence that caused it.

<ul><li> Applied uncomfortably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em>. In the first episode the Knight Sabers are sent after a man and a small girl. They go to some lengths trying to rescue the kid, but it turns out she and the man were both Boomers, and she was taken out by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>. The Knight Sabers promptly tell the company not to make Boomers that look like kids.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em> officially adopted this trope when Eas/Setsuna had her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. Both of her forms were equally good looking; instead of being killed off like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">most other female Pretty Cure villains</a>, she's spared and converted to the side of good as Cure Passion.
</li><li> It's doubtful anyone would care for the eponymous cyborgs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> if they wouldn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">look like cute, little girls</a>, since they are cold-blooded killing machines.
<ul><li> This <em>is</em> the point; the manga especially challenges viewers by making the characters sympathetic and cute, but then you have to contrast this with the fact that they are living weapons. The dichotomy even begins to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">take its toll</a> on their <em>handlers</em> after a while.
</li><li> A cyborg is a living creature with some mechanical parts, so they would look human regardless. Also, potentially dangerous things can still be cute. The fact that they could be really destructive doesn't mean it contradicts.
</li></ul></li><li> Watch the summons fighting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. Notice how animals like dogs and toads usually get beat up or, worst-case scenario, stabbed. Now notice how things like spiders, bees and centipedes get crushed, mutilated, or turned to pulp. If you consider that they all have at least <em>some</em> sapience since they can form contracts, then the Jiraya/Pain fight where the former snaps all the joints of the latter's giant crab is downright cringe-worthy.
<ul><li> This is actually not true for all summons. One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Tsunade's</a> most prominent is a giant acid-spitting slug that splits off and forms smaller slugs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster">Asteroids Monster</a> style yet is apparently one of the quietest and most docile summons compared to Jiraiya's toad, Gamabunta, and Orochimaru's snake, Manda. In addition Anko, who was one of Orochimaru's test subjects, can also summon snakes which she used to help the protagonists a few times, and Temari once summoned a giant scythe carrying weasel to defeat one of Orochimaru's minions.
</li><li> It's not necessarily about protagonist vs. antagonist. Aside from Katsuyu, invertebrate summons are treated like expendable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> that can (and do) get graphically slaughtered on-screen. And the snakes definitely get injured a lot more severely than the mammals and cute toads.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cute cartoon dog Maromi turns out to be the villain of sorts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">if he can be called that</a>, precisely <em>because</em> he is cute, and people love him, causing their collective stress to turn into a blob monster that destroys Tokyo once he disappears</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The anime more or less follows through with the games' philosophy...until you go back to the first season or so and notice that Ash had cute little Pikachu, Butterfree, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander - and that the Team Rocket trio had a floating naval mine gas cloud, and a giant purple rattlesnake. Later on though, Ash got a Muk (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuckMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuckMonster">essentially a live pile of sludge</a>) and Charmander gradually changed into the big, scary — but badass — Charizard. Additionally, Team Rocket started a sort of running gag where they acquire increasingly cute Pokémon in the newer seasons. It's also revealed that Ekans and Koffing aren't really evil (although it's stated that <em>no</em> species of Pokémon is inherently evil). In "Island of the Giant Pokémon" they are revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch Clock Villains</a> and bear no anger or malice towards Pikachu. The first Pokémon Ash captures is a Caterpie. It does evolve soon, but in the meantime Misty gets to scream about it because she's afraid of bugs and thinks it's gross. Also, Ash later gets an adorable Gligar which evolves into Gliscor — which is a huge, demonic-looking, flying scorpion thing with fangs and batlike ears. It's affectionate and a little slow in the head. But then there's also the uncomfortable realization that Ash's team hardly ever get to evolve. Unless their adult form looks cool.
</li><li> Ash's rival Paul has some pretty scary Pokémon on his team, all of them evolved. He eventually released the only one that didn't belong that he kept for a good amount of time...Ash ended up capturing it minutes later.
</li><li> The summer camp arc of the anime had a Dusknoir that tried to warn people about the evil ghost girl that was <em>really</em> trying to harm them, and getting beaten up for its trouble. It still chose to help, even putting itself at risk and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">clearing its name</a>. You just want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">take it with you and give it snacks</a>.

He goes as far as to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sacrifice himself</span> to prevent the effects of one of Palkia's Spacial Rends and Dialga's Roar of Time colliding. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He gets better in the end.</span>

<ul><li> This is why <em>Alpha playing a moon-zither</em> provides us with an illustration for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a> trope, turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

</li><li> Played with in-universe during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JapanAnimatorExpo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JapanAnimatorExpo">Japan Animator Expo</a></em> short "20 min. Walk from Nishi-Ogikubo Station". Our heroine wakes up to find she's been miniaturized, and her boyfriend is suddenly trying to kill her. It turns out she's been turned into a cockroach (and thus we've had our sympathies with one the whole time) — but while she and the audience sees herself as a regular, albeit naked human, all <em>he</em> sees is the scuttling roach form.

The Assassins prize animals for other reasons than cute; they have to be <em>professionally</em> interesting. Although Johanna and the girl students consider <em>cute</em> is a bonus. There are some definitely non-cute animals hiding in post boxes in Ankh-Morpork as a result of the Post Office mis-applying its enthusiasm...

The villainous robots, such as AUTO and GO-4, are red-eyed cyclopes with no hands or visible expressions. That said, some of the minor heroic robots have unorthodox designs; some are merely vacuums on wheels, and the intimidating WALL-As, enormous WALL-Es with four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">Glowing Eyes of Doom</a>, turn out to be nice guys.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille">Ratatouille</a></em>. Remy's major struggle is the fact that humans think rats are gross; the movie shows them as just mischievous. A bonus short on the DVD cheekily acknowledges the relationship between humans and rats throughout history. Although they <em>do</em> have a history of carrying fleas that spread disease, rats in and of themselves are actually pretty fastidious. Also mentioned in the DVD bonus short is the fact that the brown rats drove the Bubonic-Plague-carrying-flea-carrying black rats out and away from humans wherever they spread.
</li><li> Leave it to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale">Shark Tale</a></em> to get really confusing about this.

On the one hand, the heroes are ants and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam">circus troupe</a> which includes a ladybug and a chubby caterpillar, while the main villain is an ugly, voracious locust.

The sight of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hopper meeting his demise at the beaks of her fluffy little chicks</span> gives new meaning to the phrase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrotesqueCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrotesqueCute">Grotesque Cute</a>.
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> exploits this, acting as disgusting and standoffish as humans expect a big, ugly Ogre should. In truth, Shrek has a good heart, and this behavior is really because he just wants to be left alone. He explains that he'd be much happier if the stereotype didn't exist in the first place. The trope is then further played with by Fiona, who is the conventional vision of beauty...but in her "cursed" ogress form Shrek finds her beautiful, and she's happy to stay that way because he loves her and thinks she's beautiful no matter how she looks. (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">she is still pretty cute after her transformation</a>.)

Devon and Cornwall, a two-headed dragon duo who serve as comic relief, are drawn to look rather silly and harmless. A little comic relief chicken-thing is also silly-looking. A loyal falcon named Ayden has a round, sweet face, big soft eyes and cute fluttery movements. In contrast, the "evil" dragons are sharp-toothed, have squinty eyes, and look altogether more feral and the griffon henchman has another set of scary squinty eyes, a long crooked beak, bat ears, and a small head compared to his thick-maned neck — and the voice of Bronson Pinchot (we're not sure what to make of that last thing). The gryphon, though, at least was meant to be <em>cuter</em> than his original design, which was deemed "too frightening for little girls". He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> at most.
</li><li> Another obscure animated feature that gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> about this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTheAmericanRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTheAmericanRabbit">The Adventures of the American Rabbit</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Predictably</a>, the hero and most of his buddies are cute rabbits.

Too bad it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken</a> — we never ever <strong>meet</strong> any nice jackals. Every single jackal that we see in the movie is part of the biker gang.

The mice, dogs, birds, dolphins, and whales are all good guys, while the sharks are villains in league with the human villains and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">mean cats</a> are pets of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a>.

<ul><li> The one initially heroic dog is golden retriever Dug, in stark contrast to the dobermans, bulldogs, and rottweilers, who are all evil. However, it is ultimately subverted when Dug defeats the alpha male doberman and the rest immediately follow his lead. Only Alpha really comes off as evil; most of the other dogs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch Clock Villains</a> who live for praise, treats, and the occasional game of fetch (presumably) from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> More directly addressed in the short preceding <em>Up</em>, "Partly Cloudy", where a stork in charge of delivering sharks, alligators, porcupines, rams, and electric eels is getting tired of never getting any puppies or kitties. The main reason is that puppies and kitties don't <em>hurt</em> as much.
</li></ul></li><li> This arguably has to be the reason why Lucifer the cat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em> is considered one of the villains, despite that all he really tries to do throughout the film is eat the mice, which is what cats do in real life. Unlike Lucifer, the mice have human attributes with which to endear themselves to the audience.

Unfortunately, watching the movie kind of makes you want to punch the next non-cute you see right in the face. The eponymous Garbage Pail Kids are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">complete jerks.</a> One pisses himself frequently for comedic effect, another is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile">an anthropomorphic alligator</a> (presumably a carnivore too), and another is riddled with infectious disease and projectile pukes.

And the whole thing kind of reaches an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> when one realizes that the heroes just want to put them back into a tiny garbage pail...but are willing to break them out of prison and give them pep talks about how being ugly as sin and violent to boot is a-ok.
</li><li> Welcome to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JoesApartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JoesApartment">Joe's Apartment</a></em>, where this trope is played with and tossed on its ear...with cute, dancing, singing cockroaches. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TwilightOfTheCockroaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TwilightOfTheCockroaches">Twilight of the Cockroaches</a></em> does the same, albeit with an added World War II allegory.

<ul><li> The original 1954 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954">Gojira</a></em> also manages to subvert this. Godzilla appears terrifying and spends the film destroying Tokyo and killing thousands (if not millions) of people. However, he's also portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Non-Malicious Monster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> who is shown to be just as much a victim of the atomic bomb as the Japanese were.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the 1999 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera3AwakeningOfIrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera3AwakeningOfIrys">Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys</a></em>. In the film, Gamera has become rather fearsome-looking and has lost most (if not all) of his empathy towards humans to the point where he obsessively attacks the Gyaos (and kills them) without any regard to whether or not innocent people get hurt...and the JSDF decide that Gamera may be too big of a threat to keep alive. Likewise, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingOrphan">Heartwarming Orphan</a> named Ayana finds an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">oddly adorable</a> creature that she names "Irys" (after her late cat) and adopts it as her new "pet" stating that "both their families were killed by Gamera" (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ayana's family was killed by a Gyaos in a flashback to the first movie in the Heisei Trilogy</span>).

</li><li> Done cleverly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em>: even a viewer who knows nothing about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villainous role the Skrulls have played in the comics for years</span> would naturally assume that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the scary-looking, Orc-like, shapeshifting aliens who dress in black are the bad guys, which makes it a genuine shock to learn that it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">the Kree</a></span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">

</li><li> Subverted in <em>Birdwing</em>, where we find a wise, solemn, gentle and polite snake king (admittedly, he only makes one appearance before being brutally murdered, but still, he was there). Most of the swans, who the main character had up to that point associated with beauty and grace, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">shallow bullies</a>, though there are exceptions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> has a heavy-handed combo of this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoresAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoresAreMean">Carnivores Are Mean</a>.
<ul><li> At first glance, it appears as though all the heroes are herbivores and the villains are carnivores — but then you notice badgers and otters in the cast of heroes and figure out that, as usual, the heroes are all cute, cool, and popular animals and the villains are all unpopular and ugly animals (and still, no herbivores). The series goes on to get downright confusing on this point. You'd expect the owl to be a straight-up, bloodthirsty villain but...
</li><li> The badger is somewhat subverted when you imagine graphically what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">one of them does to their enemy</a>.
</li><li> Subverted again in <em>The Bellmaker</em> which contained a searat who eventually reformed and remained friends with the Redwallers. He didn't live there, though...
</li><li> Then it looks like the good guys are animals that aren't minded around farms in England, and the bad guys are the creatures considered to be "vermin" (which they're actually referred to as in the Redwall series, just to drive the point home.) But then you remember the badgers and rabbits in the good guy's ranks. And technically mice and squirrels come under the heading of "vermin" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li><li> It's confusing from the get-go. Stoats are part of Cluny's evil horde in the first novel. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat">They look like this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> And then there's the cats. Cats are generally accepted as "cute" in fiction, and they're about the only neutral species in the entire series, though the feline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>High Rhulain</em> had severe facial disfigurement.
</li><li> The psychotic barbarian Wolverine <em>cannibal</em>. Here, "cannibal" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">used to refer to eating other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">Talking Animals</a>. Wolverines actually <em>are</em> as violent as that in real life, though not with any more genuine malicious intent than your average animal, but they look like teddy bears with fluffy tails.
</li><li> Reptiles, Amphibians, and (in the first two books) foxes are even worse than the Vermin. While foxes were shown to be disloyal to either side and played hem both up, cold-blooded animals, especially snakes, are portrayed as sapient monsters.
</li><li> There was a ferret Mook (or two, or three...) being maimed, killed, and possibly eaten by a Mute Swan somewhere in "<em>Mossflower</em>" (come to think of it, that darn bird spent a good portion of the book terrorizing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Goldfish Poop Gang</a>, and gave the foxes Fortunata and Bane a run for their money.) And then there was that crazy, vermin-eating stork in "<em>Martin the Warrior</em>". He had a knack for crying out "I am the laaaawwwwww..." as he descended upon his prey. Needless to say, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Martin and his cohorts were pretty darn worried that they could end up on his menu themselves while he was escorting them across his territory</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em>, the good guys are cuddly horses and dogs and the like, while the poor old downtrodden proletariat are fluffy, easily led sheep, dull-witted horses, and quirky chickens. Tellingly, the puppies become vicious, unhuggable Rottweiler types as they become more indoctrinated to Napoleon the pig's side. And Moses the raven is ambiguous. As far as the pigs, even the implicitly cute little Snowball was not as okay as he seemed; during the turning point of the novel (when the pigs claimed the apples and milk for themselves), even Snowball's own greed was apparent, as this was one of the few issues that both he and Napoleon could agree upon. The book itself says that the pigs were chosen as the leaders because they're the smartest animals on the farm, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Symbolically, they were also most likely chosen for their association with greed.
</li><li> Lampshaded and deconstructed multiple times in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Founding of the Commonwealth</a> series: the first aliens humanity encounters are the insectoid Thranx, which they are extremely wary of, but turn out to be friendly and have very similar ideologies (to the point where even the anti-unification terrorists on both sides end up working together). The second species that they encounter are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Pitar</a> who are very human-like in appearance, but who are really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobes</a> who only tolerate humanity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen">steal the women</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator">Uterine Replicators</a> to save their plummeting birthrate</span>.
<ul><li> Played straight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">reptilian Aan</a> who are the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater Scope Villains</a> of the <em>Pip and Flinx</em> subseries.
</li></ul></li><li> Inevitable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia">Dinotopia</a></em> Animal Trope Entry: Be assured that James Guerney mostly picks his main cast of animal characters based on how much fun they are to paint. Which means that animals most people wouldn't usually consider cute, like Budge the Estemmenosuchus, get to be the good guys. (For those not in the know, Este...uh, Budge's species <a class="urllink" href="http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/400Therapsida/400.420.html">looks like this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> In <em>Yvain</em>, an Arthurian chivalric romance, the hero comes upon a fight between a dragon and a lion. He chooses to step in and help the <em>lion</em>, specifically because, "...a venomous and wicked creature deserves only harm: the dragon was venomous and fire leapt from its mouth because it was so full of wickedness." Nice and subtle that.
</li><li> Conversely, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a> novels, people admire both dragons and fire lizards so much that animals which normally benefit from the "cute" image, such as dogs and horses, are seldom treated as anything more than organic tools. Even animal-loving Piemur calls his runnerbeast (= horse) "Stupid" and remarks on how ugly it is, presumably because it's neither as smart nor as glamorous as a dragon.
<ul><li> Runnerbeasts are not necessarily horses, they merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor">serve the same purpose for that world</a> and have only the most basic physical resemblance. Additionally the <em>dragons</em> resemble equines...and watch-whers, a close cousin of dragons and fire lizards, are considered the ugliest things in existence. But dolphins, normally considered "cute", <em>are</em> regarded as ugly, vicious predators for much of Pern's history.
</li></ul></li><li> An issue of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RangerRick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RangerRick">Ranger Rick</a></em>, which is published by the National Wildlife Federation, had a short story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">that pointed this trope out</a> rather directly. The animals of Big Green Wood propose holding a support group for all severely endangered animals. Everyone is all for it, except for Boomer the Badger, who was extremely unsympathetic to the plights of the less cute and cuddly animals like the Komodo Dragon. That night, Boomer has a nightmare in which badgers had been put on the world's cut list and would go extinct unless Boomer alone could plead their case, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">realized his hypocrisy</a>.

</div><ul><li> There was also a <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RangerRick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RangerRick">Ranger Rick</a></em> book entitled <em>The Unhuggables</em>, and it was all about the animals unfairly affected by this trope, so good on National Wildlife Federation.
</li></ul></li><li> Garry Kilworth's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelkinWeasels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelkinWeasels">Welkin Weasels</a></em> series subverts this quite frequently. The heroes are weasels, the stoats are mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antivillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antivillain">antivillains</a>, the black rats are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, and the Norway rats are good. Hedgehogs are nice, but moles aren't. The first book has an evil sheep and an evil fox (both of which are traditionally nice animals), and the second one has an <em>evil zombie badger</em>. <em>Windjammer Run</em> also contains the line "You could not find a more honourable bird than a raven or a more treacherous creature than a dove."
</li><li> This and several other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalTropes">Animal Tropes</a> were well-addressed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingMauriceAndHisEducatedRodents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingMauriceAndHisEducatedRodents">The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</a></em>. In it, a few animals have gained human-like intelligence thanks to magic — and the key there is <em>human-like</em>. The "Educated Rodents" were always clever and cunning; intelligent the way rats already are. However, gaining the ability to understand human language caused them to gradually think more and more like humans, worrying about the future, fretting about money. And, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">they darn well know about this trope</a>, angsting about what humans would do to them if they knew. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After heroically saving a small town from a truly nasty creature, the rats effectively out themselves to the humans. The humans and rats negotiate with each other and the town becomes a well-loved tourist destination, where people go and learn just how nice rats really are.</span>
<div class="indent"><em>"Had it been made for humans? The shop had been made for humans, true, but surely even humans wouldn't make a book about Ratty Rupert the Rat, who wore a hat, <strong>and</strong> poison rats under the floorboards at the same time. Would they? How mad would anything have to be to think like that?"</em>
</div><ul><li> Quoth the Raven is also aware of this trope, claiming he would receive better treatment if he were cute like a robin. Robins don't typically manage to work their love of eating eyeballs into every conversation.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, both Magrat and Nanny Ogg muse about how if cats looked like frogs, people would more easily realise that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">Cats Are Mean</a>, comparing it to the glamour cast by the elves.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly addressed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Silverwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Silverwing">Silverwing</a></em> trilogy of children's books. The main characters are all bats, traditionally a creature humanity considers menacing. The divide between "good" and "evil" bats is at least somewhat racial — the villains are carnivorous False Vampire Bats, while the "good" bats are smaller, more conventionally cute ones. However, the villains are primarily marked not by their frightening appearances, but by their predatory habits and worship of an evil deity. The Big Fat Traitor is the vampire bat, by the way, it's straightened like an arrow in the cartoon.
</li><li> The Caldecott medalist picture book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stellaluna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stellaluna">Stellaluna</a></em> is about a bat. (For good measure, it's a <em>female</em> bat.)
</li><li> In the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Destroyermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Destroyermen">Destroyermen</a> book, the readers are introduced to two intelligent races on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">parallel Earth</a>. One is an intelligent lemur race that is so cute that several of the human characters want to sleep with them. The other is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race that evolved from raptors, and engage in genocidal wars, violent slaughter, and collect the skulls of their enemies. The lemurs are, obviously, the more heroic ones.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz">Dean Koontz</a>'s novels, anyone who owns, likes, or is liked by a golden retriever is invariably a good guy, while anyone or anything who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">endangers or otherwise moves against one</a> is the purest of ultimate evil.
<ul><li> For that matter, in his somewhat obscure children's book <em>Oddkins: A Fable for all Ages</em>, the heroes are stuffed animals and the villains are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> dolls.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> — the Hork-Bajir are enormous lizard people with natural blades on their limbs, and act as shock troops for the invading Yeerk army. When the lead characters are told that they "are to be pitied" upon first seeing with them, this advice is met with puzzlement and immediately dismissed. However, it soon becomes apparent that the Hork-Bajir are naturally gentle, nonviolent <em>herbivores</em>; they use their blades only for stripping off the tree bark they eat.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uxwi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uxwi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uxwi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A prequel novel involves one of them being attacked by a controller and being <em>unable to realize what is happening to him</em>, because he is completely unfamiliar with violence. </span> The main cast are surprised at this revelation, and Tobias is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">ashamed at the more vicious and destructive nature of humans</a>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main cast assists in freeing some Hork-Bajir from Yeerk control and setting up a free settlement, they help (usually in non-combat ways) to fight the invaders</span>.
<ul><li> Generally played straight with the Yeerks.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by Visser One: "Snails, slugs, leeches...the comparisons are never endearing."
</li><li> Even then, the Yeerk Empire might be evil, but the average yeerk is not necessarily so.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with the Taxxons, mostly. The insatiable hunger doesn't help them any...
<ul><li> Subverted later on in the series though, when it's revealed that the Taxxons are intelligent beings that made a deal with the Yeerks in the hopes that the Yeerks would be able to control their hunger.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with the Andalites as well. They are a race typically described as deer-like centaurs that have great respect for nature and honor. And they are so xenophobic and intolerant of the handicapped, it would make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">many types of Elves</a> say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Screw You, Elves!</a>.
</li><li> Goes without saying that this is a series where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> is a representative Democracy that hides their head of state in part to prevent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> and the Designated Hero race seems to be governed by the Military Hierarchy. As a whole, Animorphs relished in subverting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>... but they also through out Always Lawful Good.
</li></ul></li><li> Avoided in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a> book <em>Castle Roogna</em>, where Dor's friend for much of the book is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">Giant Spider</a> named Jumper. There's also a friendly, spider-like monster in <em>Golem in the Gears</em>, and other various nonthreatening oddities throughout the series.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardiansOfGaHoole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardiansOfGaHoole">Guardians of Ga'Hoole</a></em>, where Owls are the main characters and snakes are helpful and kind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unless said snake's name is Gragg of Slonk.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a> brings this up in his book <em>Brain Droppings</em>. "If lobsters looked like puppies, nobody would dip them in boiling water. But instead they look like science-fiction monsters, so it's okay."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore">R.A. Salvatore</a> in the short story "Dark Mirrors" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">acknowledged</a> an element of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt">Drizzt Do'Urden</a> series's popularity, exploring the different reactions humans have to different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> races. See, dark elves are exotic and beautiful (and powerful), and <em>goblins</em> are...<em>not</em>. A given member of either race may happen to be a decent individual, but they are received in different ways. Drizzt experiences considerable mistrust, but is given the chance to prove himself; Nojheim, on the other hand, is enslaved and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually put down</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in numerous works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley">Robin McKinley</a>, notably the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseDaughter">Rose Daughter</a></em>, in which spiders, bats, toads, and hedgehogs play positive roles in the plot.
</li><li> There's an in-story instance of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThiefLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThiefLord">The Thief Lord</a></em>, and applied to humans, strangely. Esther dotes over Bo only because he's a cute, innocent-looking little boy and refuses to take Prosper into her home because he "doesn't look like a teddy bear anymore".
</li><li> Subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>. The creature is instantly hated by everyone who sees him because he is so monstrously ugly. In reality, he's just looking for love and companionship, but the injustice of his treatment eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">turns him as evil as people think he is</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackCampbell">Jack Campbell</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a> novel <em>Invincible</em>,
<ul><li> The bear-cows look very much like teddy bears, which causes officers to comment on the coincidence in view of their brutal and instant attacks, which show no regard even for their own species.
</li><li> The spider-wolves, however, look very much like things out of nightmares — even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> — which gives officers qualms even after they become the first race humanity can actually establish friendly relations with, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">they fight together against the bear cows</a>. This is all the more ironic in that they clearly share human aesthetics in several ways: their ships are marvels of elegance, their ship formations are beautiful mathematical patterns, and their multi-color clothing never clashes in human eyes.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight by most of the elves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineGoblins">Nine Goblins</a></em>, which is why Sings-to-Trees is left alone to take care of all the creatures that are not (currently) meeting the elves' haughty standards.
</li><li> Inverted in Harry Harrison and Jack C. Haldeman II's <em>Bill, The Galactic Hero; On the Planet of Zombie Vampires</em>, parodying the <em>Alien</em> franchise. The marines find it impossible to kill the creatures wrapped around their comrades' heads because they're just <em>too cute</em> - sort of a cross between a teddy bear and a duckling; not quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Killer Rabbit</a>, because it's quite obviously dangerous, but its looks interfere with trying to get rid of it.
</li><li> The poem <em>Maggots</em> plays with this, as the titular maggots are described as maggots would be (squirmy, smelly, nauseating) but, somehow, the subject manages to consider them as endearing (if a little gross) and dubs them "pets", instead of doing what people would normally do when they see maggots.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, Bitch's power is to turn dogs into huge, bony monster dogs, but don't you dare hurt one when she's around. Before long, Taylor becomes so used to them that she forgets they are scary to normal people and heroes. She completely recognizes that the bugs she controls are also disturbing to people, and uses them to that effect, but she reaches the point where she has no problem using them as masks and to help her get ready in the morning.
</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pinduli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pinduli">Pinduli</a></em> is a young hyena who gets bullied by other animals for being "ugly". The other animals themselves were bullied by others, and thus they turned into bullies as well. The end aesop is to not bully and to love yourself.
</li><li> Hank spells this trope out to a grieving Junior the Buzzard<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1co9j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1co9j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1co9j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A turkey vulture, not the kind of hawk</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HankTheCowdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HankTheCowdog">Hank the Cowdog</a></em> after Junior's dad Wallace collides with Slim's truck.
<div class="indent"><em>"The cold hard facts of the matter are that if your old man was a cat, a dog, a rabbit, a deer, a duck, or almost anything but a buzzard, somebody would come along this road, see him out there in the snow, take him home, and nurse him back to health."</em>
</div></li><li> Some humans are cuter than others, as noted in <em>Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy</em> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxHastings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxHastings">Max Hastings</a>. From the chapter about the end of the Saigon regime:
<div class="indent"> Meanwhile, flights were organised by crassly sentimental foreign philanthropists to evacuate Saigon orphanages. No sane person could suppose that the victorious Communists would murder pretty children. Instead, pot bellied ARVN officers, unlovely bureaucrats and policemen faced mortal peril; they, however, were bereft of foreign friends.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungleBook">The Jungle Book</a></em>, the story, "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi" has a mongoose, a seemingly weasel-like creature most famous as a predator of snakes, as the hero. The imagery of a cute furry fellow facing off against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesAreSinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesAreSinister">murderous snakes</a> is such a sharp contrast that it is irresistible to think of it as a heroic battle against the personification of evil.

<ul><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em>: As the family has a bizarre behavior liking everything that most normal people would dislike and vice versa, what they find cute is the exact opposite; octopus, piranhas, spiders, snakes, carnivorous plants, etc. They also have a pet lion although lions are generally included in the cute category so the joke is that is an adult lion that can kill you (but as the rest of the family, is harmless).
</li><li> Spoo, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, is a small wormlike critter that happens to be a delicacy (aged and chilled to the Centauri, fresh to the Narn, though whether it's a matter of taste or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to their former oppressors is up to the viewer), but is considered one of the ugliest creatures in known space. Even the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League's official policy towards the treatment and well being of spoo is simply "Kill 'em."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror">Black Mirror</a></em>: Played with using <em>Roachbusters</em> and <em>Terror on Rannoch-3</em>, two games mentioned on the <a class="urllink" href="https://tuckersoft.net/ealing20541/history/">Tuckersoft<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> website introduced with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMirrorBandersnatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMirrorBandersnatch">Bandersnatch</a></em>. In <em>Roachbusters</em>, you're in charge of killing cartoon cockroaches and collecting stars, which normally would constitute this trope. But compared to its sequel <em>Terror on Rannoch-3</em>, which is described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> and whose cover shows a glamourized "roach" (a bug-eyed vampiresque humanoid) screaming in fear, the gung-ho attitude to killing the comparitively cuter cockroaches makes this an inversion.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2556s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2556s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2556s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unlike the games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorMenAgainstFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorMenAgainstFire">episode</a> they're referencing leans more into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>.</span>

Larry refused to attend when he discovered the development wouldn't threaten anything more impressive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Periodically subverted when the Doctor compliments the appearance of various alien creatures that most viewers would react to with this trope. It underlines that no matter how much humans LOOK Time Lord, the Doctor isn't human.
</li><li> The flesh-eating spider-hatchlings of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2006CSTheRunawayBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2006CSTheRunawayBride">Racnoss</a> get drowned in the Thames, while the chubby smiling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E1PartnersInCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E1PartnersInCrime">Adipose</a> babies are "just children" who "can't help where they came from". You wouldn't expect this kind of bias from the Doctor, of all people, but there it is.
<ul><li> Actually it's not "bias" on his part at all. Firstly, the Adipose babies are harmless and the process used to make them can be done without harm. The process, however, can be done more quickly with fatal results. The Doctor prevented the fatal version, something he couldn't do to stop the ravenous horde of Racnoss coming to eat all humans on Earth. Secondly, Donna (who witnessed both the Racnoss and the Adipose) explicitly points out this change in the Doctor's attitude and remarks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">spending time with Martha must have done him good</a>. The Doctor agrees. On the other hand, it's very much an example of this trope on the part of the <em>writers</em>, since they quite clearly set up the parallel on purpose.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em> called "The Golden Man" dealt with this. Penny, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>, meets a hideous frog alien, while Dr. Smith meets a handsome humanoid alien that is solid gold. The two aliens are at war with each other. The one that turns out to actually be the good guy is, surprisingly, the frog alien. The true form of the titular Golden Man, however, is even uglier than the frog alien.
</li><li> The idea is lampshaded by Col. Potter in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>. He gets very upset about the fact the locals have to eat horses.
<div class="indent">"Where do people get off eating horses? You ever get a good look at a cow or a pig? They're ugly. We're doing them a favor eating them, saves them looking at their own reflection in the trough every morning. But a horse, that's a noble animal."
</div></li><li> Uncomfortably applied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, where you'd think they'd know better. Some episodes subvert this, however.

Most of them tend to be violent barbarians who run around pillaging, raping, and occasionally eating the humans they come across. Most notable in this category are the Wolfmen of the North and Raksi's baby-eating Apemen. However, the Hawkmen and Snakemen of Halta and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharkMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharkMan">Sharkmen and Squidmen</a> of Luthe are perfectly civilized people. Granted, however, that the little sharkgirl in the comic preceding the Luthe chapter of <em>Compass of Terrestrial Directions: West</em> was quite adorable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> does this quite a bit.
<ul><li> Werewolves and wererats are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a></em> and Always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> respectively while werebears are <em>Always Lawful Good</em> and werecats are always neutral.
</li><li> Then there are anthromorphic Hyenas, also known as gnolls, which are...well...they have a penchant for enslaving other humanoids, and that's when they're not <em>eating</em> them (and they have a knack for eating their slaves sooner or later.) Gnolls just do it because they're sadistic - the Monster Manual outright states that "they enjoy intelligent prey because they scream more."
</li><li> Depending on the source, gnolls themselves subvert this trope. They're never described as 'good' but they can certainly have more noble aspects to them. The origin story is that Yeenoghu, their demon god fed a pack of demons to mortal hyenas and so gnolls have the two sides to them...demon and hyena. Monsters and Hunters.
</li><li> Blink Dogs are good monsters with a built in ability like the blink spell, while their evil counterparts (displacer beasts) resemble emaciated, tentacled panthers. There's even a race of always neutral good celestials that are essentially anthropomorphic animals. There are lion people, wolf people, horse people, bird people, mouse people, and bear people among the celestials. There's also an anthromorphic dog type of celestials, the Hound Archons, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">Always Lawful Good</a>. Most insect monsters favor evil over good — the exception being Formians, who are always lawful neutral (though in AD&amp;D2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a>, before they replaced now-corrupted Modrons, were lawful neutral/<em>good</em>) instead and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">Thri-Kreen</a>, if they aren't removed again) There are a few exceptions. Naga (snakelike creatures) has good, neutral and evil variants, and lizardfolk are generally viewed as neutral, if usually primitive and hostile to PCs.
</li><li> Lizardfolk are a little like the gnolls in terms of being vicious and sometimes predatory, but lizardfolk only do it if they need to survive - survival is their top priority, actually, and they don't have any other agendas (well, in <em>most</em> cases. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Some lizardfolk can be downright vile</a>.)

</li></ul></li><li> As for the eponymous dragons, it's an interesting variation. The metallics are always good, and tend to look noble and/or wise. The chromatics are always evil and tend to look fierce and, subjectively ugly.
<ul><li> in 4th Edition this overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>, since metallic dragons are described as equally brutal, greedy, self-centered, dictatorial and arrogant as chromatic dragons, and about the Tiamat-Bahamut conflict they are even more cruel and racist than the chromatic ones. yes, a chromatic dragon would kill a metallic one at sight, but metallic dragons enjoy not just killing chromatic ones(even wyrmlings aren't spared!), but mafia-style intimidating and forcing them into betraying their own kin too. why they are described as 'good'? because they're slightly more benevolent to humanoids.

If the two looks synonymous, well...and both see in the darkness. What's the difference? Rule of thumb: if it's "cute", it's a Magical Beast, if not, it's an Aberration.
<ul><li> <em>Lords of Madness</em>, later in the line, took some steps towards codifying what qualifies as an "aberration", specifically qualifying them as having unnatural origins rather than merely exotic characteristics. Several prominent aberration species received expanded explanation that qualified their otherworldly, alien, or unnatural makeup. Another defining distinction is their lack of an ecosystem role (providing Chuuls' lack of natural predators as one example).

Doing this quest will get you an item that severely weakens the main boss of that area, but the Yensa that posted the bill is executed because their queen doesn't like interacting with outsiders.

</li></ul></li><li> The Koopa Troopas of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a></em> games have become increasingly more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">anthropomorphized</a> as the series has gone on. They started out as slightly cartoony four-legged turtles that you couldn't care less about killing off. As the series has gone on, their appearance has changed. They were given the ability to walk on two legs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, and one was made a playable character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart">Super Mario Kart</a></em> (though he was bumped off by then newcomer Wario until the more recent entries in the series). The current character design for Koopa Troopa (and its winged brethren, Paratroopa) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorableEvilMinions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorableEvilMinions">is now on a level of cuteness</a> rivaling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Yoshi</a>. Nintendo has noted this, and Troopas hardly ever appear as enemies anymore, and when they do they're either in short supply (like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>) or they're usually given some sort of accessory that lowers their cuteness factor, such as the spiked armband and pointy sunglasses wearing variants of the Paper Mario series (there all Koopas with sunglasses are evil and those without are friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>. At a certain point in Chapter 3 a normal Koopa gets brainwashed by the villains and suddenly wears sunglasses). They also make frequent appearances in spinoff games either as playable characters or harmless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>. Now contrast this with the Goombas, who've hardly had any major design changes, usually require accessories to make them cuter in the few games where they exist as an ally, have only been in the RPGs and <em>Mario Baseball</em> games as playable characters, and are the most common enemy type even in the latest games.
</li><li> Both played with and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. On the one hand, the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">humanoid</a>, pleasant-looking races form the Alliance, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">usually framed as</a> the more protagonistic faction. But on the other hand, the fierce, alien and sometimes downright ugly races of the Horde are playable characters and are also sometimes portrayed in a positive light, just as the Alliance races can be malicious. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Particularly humans.</a>)
<ul><li> The Tauren are a very good example; aligned with the Horde faction, they can be easily described as 800 pound bipedal cows. Naturally, they gain a health boost as a racial ability, being extremely tall and muscular. And they are, surprisingly, extremely peaceful most of the time.
</li></ul></li><li> Berserker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/Stay Night</a></em> is reminiscent of Goliath from the <em>Gargoyles</em>. If you can get past his lead-grey complexion, odd elbow protrusions, mismatched set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">blood red</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes">glowing gold</a> eyes, and frighteningly <em>huge</em> size, he's really handsome. Indeed, he's the demigod Herakles from Greek myth, who was quite popular with the ladies <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">the guys</a>. But he's not as pretty as the other manly warrior-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> of the game, and except for a brief time in one scenario, he's always under a mental compulsion that reduces him to a constantly growling and bellowing monster. A pity, considering who they got to voice him in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">The Anime of the Game</a>. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">he does have those moments with Ilya...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DroneTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DroneTactics">Drone Tactics</a></em> plays into this. Although both the player and enemy units are giant robotic bugs, the good guys get "cute" bugs like stag beetles, fireflies, and snails, while the bad guys get "creepier" ones like ants, mosquitoes, and water bugs.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>. You just can't take the cuteness out of a teddy bear, no matter how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">fascist</a> and cybered-up you make them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em> is a particularly egregious example of this. It has lots of cute fluffy animals, and their character type seems to be determined by just how cute the animal in question is (i.e. the kitten animal is a cute girly airhead type while the rockhopper penguin is a grumpy little fellow). Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish">the Coelacanth only makes a cameo appearance as the most expensive fish you can fish up</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryConfusion">insects are only present to either be caught and added to your collection, or to be a nuisance</a>.
<ul><li> Of all the marine life that appear, only octopi (which tend to be seen as cute in media) get the villager treatment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish">No Cartoon Fish</a> is in full effect for the rest, used only for catching and eating.
</li><li> Played with concerning Blathers. He'll enthusiastically tell you about anything you give him, no matter how non-cute we consider it, but he's terrified of insects. He gives butterflies a pass, though, due to how cute he finds their bellies.
</li><li> While the villagers themselves don't invoke this trope on each other, the players (especially the villager trading circuit) frequently indulge in it. "Cuter" animals like bunnies, dogs, and cats are highly desired for towns, while the "non-cute" species like frogs, gators and gorillas rank lower. Though even that is variable; if the villager is more on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonkish</a> side, no matter how pleasant they are, then the player's perfectly free to bully and report them until they feel like moving out and bringing in a villager that matches the town's aesthetic. Even if they have the same personality, a Lazy villager like <a class="urllink" href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Beau">Beau<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (an orange deer with sleepy eyes) would generally be seen as endearingly lazy compared to, say, <a class="urllink" href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Prince">Prince<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (a frog with wide eyes, a 5-o'-clock shadow, and cream lips), who is generally treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a>.

The non-anthro characters are a different story...
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII">Overlord II</a></em>, the reason your minions hate the cute baby seals is because they eat those "Poor Fishies", they think wolves are cute puppies, you fight man-eating pandas, and a group of hippy Elves are trying to stop you from doing all this, even saying "You're just mad because your minions aren't cute!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HelloKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HelloKitty">Hello Kitty</a> Online</em> is weird about this.

Aside from Kero, which arguably goes more on the cute side, it's hard to tell if they're cute or ugly/evil-looking. To push it further, in the case of the Koala who's proved as a mean-spirited fellow, at least two characters hates its guts (Yuina and Naomi), but it's <em>loved</em> by Miharu (who even puts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">her hair in koala-ears shape</a>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Megumi</a>.

Rats are not only useful creatures, but intelligent and cultured (critiquing bad poets by nibbling their books). Although the aforementioned hyenas initially try to kill the protagonist, they're eventually shown to be a fairly typical primitive, somewhat insular, tribal people; and eventually end up adopting her into their tribe.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em>, surprisingly enough, played with this trope quite a bit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a> after all):

</li><li> The TV series gives us the episode "Fugitive Flowers". In it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Hippie-Chick Pony</a> Posey is (<em>way</em> too) easily convinced by a group of cute little talking flowers that the giant, scary crab monsters following them are evil.

The crab monsters were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guys</a> hoping to stop them.
</li><li> Also, the Ponies being so quick to distrust the crab monsters is a little more explainable when one remembers that A: they introduce themselves by ripping apart everything in sight (making for a bad first impression) and B: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">they won't stop and explain themselves</a>, and C: they call <em>themselves</em> "Crabnasties". That's not exactly the sort of name to inspire confidence in their fundamental benevolence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Swarm of the Century" has Fluttershy finding an adorable bug in the forest and taking it home. The other ponies coo over its cuteness (minus Pinkie Pie, who seems to know what it is, but fails to share her apparent knowledge with anyone), despite the fact that it has suddenly become three bugs. All too soon, the ponies realize that these bugs not only multiply rapidly, but also eat everything in sight and create mayhem and destruction wherever they go. By episode's end, they are over their initial enamor.
</li><li> This trope is frequently subverted with Fluttershy, who is truly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>. She has absolutely no problem with any animal, including mythical creatures like a Manticore (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">adult dragons,</a> which she was <em>terrified</em> of, but she got over that), as well as normal animals not usually considered cute, such as vultures, snakes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell">bats</a>. While she's usually accompanied by a rabbit named Angel, he's generally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentSnarker">Silent Snarker</a> at his best.
</li><li> As the series has gone on it has begun to subvert this frequently. Originally the cute ponies were the good ones and the villains were sinister in appearance like Nightmare Moon and Discord. Now we have cute ponies as villains like the Flim-Flam Brothers and Doctor Caballeron, and both Nightmare Moon and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Discord</span> have since become good guys with the latter keeping his sinister appearance. Starlight Glimmer, The Season 5 Premiere villain, despite being an otherwise normal unicorn with <em>one</em> nasty spell in her arsenal is debatably the scariest villain the series has produced yet.
</li><li> Inverted in "Bats!", where Applejack and Fluttershy argue over the fate of some vampire fruit bats that are a threat to Sweet Apple Acres. During their <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKQAoa9aikM">song cue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when Applejack is singing they look like the post-transformation mogwais from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em> and when Fluttershy describes them they look quite fluffy and cute, showing that Applejack sees them as monstrous because of the threat they pose while Fluttershy sees them as cute because she sympathizes with them.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similarly, an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">ThunderCats</a></em> features a cop and a criminal: a sinister, brutal-looking alien and a shiny gold, fragile-looking robot in white robes, respectively. It wasn't even a reptilian alien — as would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">frequently used for this trope or an attempt to play with it</a> — but something even "creepier" by most standards; a hairy scorpion-man, complete with pincers, a tail and chelicerae! "Cute" sidekick Snarf actually failed to appreciate the lesson in the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyOHareAndTheToadWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyOHareAndTheToadWars">Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars</a></em> was all over this trope like butter on toast.
<ul><li> The show concerns an interplanetary war between the Toads and various mammalian species. Now, it's not like this isn't typical for this trope, but consider this: it isn't just that "Toads are ugly so it's okay to antagonize them". The Toads' planet had been taken over by an evil computer which militarized their society and <em>brainwashed the Toads into conquering other worlds</em>. So now the other animals are fighting what are armies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">brainwashed minions</a>.
</li><li> Additionally, in an early episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Al Negator</a> tries to get a job on Bucky's ship, the Righteous Indignation. As he's a shifty-looking reptile, the crew is generally suspicious. But Captain Bucky O'Hare hires him anyway, making a big point of mentioning how he trusted the gunner Deadeye Duck, despite him being a pirate with somewhat questionable morals. So it looks like a "beauty is on the inside" or "different doesn't mean bad" kind of Aesop... until <em>Al betrays them</em>, steals classified info, and sabotages the ship. giving off a very family unfriendly aesop on how someone that looks evil <em>is</em> evil.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a></em> plays with this trope endlessly. The staff includes a warthog, a chameleon, a goldfish, a baboon, a pixie frog and an elephant, all of whom have personalities that vary wildly with their appearances; the snake is friendly, helpful <em>and</em> a member of the main cast (one notable episode had him apparently fighting with a mongoose, only to be revealed that they were just playing tag); the (spider) monkey is the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>; and the human, instead of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">bastard</a>, is just trying to survive amongst the insanity. The shark, however, <em>is</em> the school bully, but like most fictional bullies, he's a coward who hides his insecurities behind violence.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> in one episode where Dexter and Dee Dee joined manly and cute clubs respectively. Due to accidentally mixing up the instructions for initiation, Dexter enters the club full of action-ready guys dressed in a tutu and carrying a tin of cookies. Dee Dee enters the cute pony club dressed in combat fatigues. The dangerous looking men immediately recognized the swapped instructions as a common mistake and shared a laugh at the whole affair in a friendly manner with Dexter. Meanwhile, the cute ponies are ready to drop Dee Dee into a boiling cauldron for not being cute enough!
</li><li> Figures heavily in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, where the eponymous species was nearly hunted to extinction because of their monstrous appearance. Most of the gargoyle-friendly humans don't mind and, indeed, some fans of the show find them rather cute. Goliath — if you can get past the wings, fangs, horns, and talons — could be seen as downright handsome. (And let's face it, any character with Keith David's voice is going to have less trouble with the ladies than he might otherwise.)
<ul><li> Humorously subverted in one episode, where Elisa (the lead human) is turned into a gargoyle herself. Goliath admits that he never realized she was so beautiful, and it is implied that gargoyles find humans just as physically unattractive as humans find gargoyles.
<ul><li> In the same episode, Elisa was just short of being all over Goliath in the few moments when they were both humans. Although they were already close friends beforehand, it seems that seeing each other as the same species kick-started it into an attraction.
</li><li> As well, the later seasons/comic series makes it pretty explicit that it's something both sides can get over. In the show, from their globe-wandering on, the two of them display as much sexual frustration about their relationship hurdles as you could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">get away with in a Disney show</a>. The comic rather implies that the frustration part may be a thing of the past, as Elisa dons a dress that could only be called "boobtastic" (though not really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a>) in preparation for a night out with Goliath that she muses should be "quite the hot time".

When Gaia sends the rings to the five kids, each of them gets a short scene illustrating their affinity with their element. Ma-Ti's Heart is demonstrated by him saving a trapped monkey from... being eaten by some sort of large wild cat, sending the message that carnivores don't count as Gaia's creatures.

Leela rescues one, which immediately starts attacking her and trying to drain her blood. She fights it off, nearly kills it, then resuscitates it before the cycle repeats itself. Eventually she ends up caging it, the apparent lesson being that just because an endangered species is ugly and hostile doesn't mean it should be exterminated. Then, mere minutes before the ending it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this species of leech is the most recent manifestation of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race bent on exterminating other species</span>.

<ul><li> "Fun with Veal" revolves around the boys getting into a standoff with the FBI to stop a bunch of calves from being slaughtered. While the episode still mocks vegetarians —not eating meat causes Stan to starting turning into a literal vagina— it surprisingly never calls attention to the fact that they're only going to such lengths to save the calves because they're considered cuter than adult cattle (which none of them particularly care about).
</li><li> The episode "Whale Whores" concerns Stan's attempts to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales. In typical <em>South Park</em> fashion, it is revealed the Japanese believe those species are responsible for the atomic bombing.

Similarly, it was a-okay for the owls and foxes to eat mice, rats, etc- as long as they were non-talking, non-Farthing wood mice. Then in the third season...whoa. A bunch of rats were introduced to the story, and since they were all evil, they all had over the top, cartoony evil features (Claws! Fangs!

Joe is a mix of rhino and stork, Entreee is a mix of cow, pig, chicken and shrimp. The only legitimately evil mutant we've seen is a hybrid of dolphin and monkey, both typically considered cute animals.

<ul><li> There is a massive ongoing debate in Canada—and internationally, given the EU ban on seal products—right now over the baby harp seal hunt. Many people have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy in caring about the systematic killing of adorable fuzzy seals, as opposed to something not particularly cute such as cattle.
<ul><li> In the late 1980s, when this issue first flared up in a major way, it was more the "club something adorable to death" issue people had a problem with, and may still be a prime motivator today.
</li><li> Even today, the image used by anti-hunt advocates is almost always that of a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitecoat">whitecoat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a newborn seal with a cute white coat. People don't tend to root for the Hooded Seal, also hunted (and, unlike the harp seal, actually endangered) because it looks like a Cthuloid abomination.
</li></ul></li><li> Sharks on the other hand are killed in cruel ways comparable to seals, having their fins cut off and the rest of the animal thrown, <em>alive</em>, back into the water to either bleed to death or be attacked by other marine animals. As the general public see sharks as big scary killers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ta6q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ta6q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ta6q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only around six people per year are killed by sharks; statistically you are more likely to be killed by a dog, cow, deer, or <em>falling icicles</em></span>, very few people outside of shark experts actually care.
</li><li> This trope became incredibly obvious during a commercial break on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a>: A commercial was aired from the Humane Society about animal abuse, which among understandable footage of maimed dogs and cats had a shot of a seal being clubbed while the narrator explained how horrible it is to harm or even kill a living animal. Immediately afterward was a commercial for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestCatch">Deadliest Catch</a></em>, a show about the unsympathetic systematic slaughter of millions of crabs that are killed in much less humane ways than the seals.
</li><li> German "science" TV show <em>Galileo</em> did a shocking documentary about tigers in a Korean zoo being raised under horrible conditions like too small cages, a true scandal. Then the next day they showed people eating (and chewing) living frog and skinning a snake while it was still alive, that fell under their <em>cool</em> section.
</li><li> Some Spanish people point this out, wondering why bullfighting is legal and dog fighting is not.
</li><li> In North America, there is widespread opposition to the slaughter of horses and their use as meat. They seem to have no such qualms about, say, cattle.
<ul><li> Prevalent in the Anglosphere and Western world in general. Horses were eaten in Pagan rituals, and the church discourage this. In the 19th century there was an attempt to use old work horses as cheap food for the poor, but it never really caught on. Combine this with horses being very valuable for much of their history, and the fact that people work closely with them makes killing them, and eating them a bigger deal than cows.
</li><li> In the west horses tend to be companion or work animals and in the case of the former there is an implicit bargain that if an animal has a trust relationship with a human, that animal should not be eaten. When a horse is engaged as a work animal the simple truth is that after years of hard work they simply would not taste very good. Beef Cattle and other livestock are raised as food from birth and therefore humans rarely form bonds with them.
</li><li> To simplify the above, eating a horse is like betraying one of humanity's best friends for many centuries. Many people think cows are cute, but they are merely considered food rather than friends by society, having been bred just to be eaten. Even though we have used cattle as work animals just as much as horses, we called them oxen.
</li><li> A considerable amount of effort and money goes into protecting the American Mustang which is an introduced species descended from escaped horses brought to North America by the Spanish. The amount of effort and money going into protecting the Mustang is significantly greater than goes into protecting many genuine indigenous endangered species. Fossil records however have shown that horses did exist in North America before they befell the same fate shared by many of North America's megafauna (like Mammoths and North American Lions). So it is thought that their presence is actually restoring a bit of the environment that was once lost. The same cannot be said for the Australian Brumby (Horses were never native to Australia).
</li><li> The tendency for westerners to get squicked out at the prospect of eating "cute" animals like dogs, cats and horses has not been lost on animal rights activists. They argue that it's hypocritical for people to feel this way while thinking it's OK to eat cows, pigs and chickens.
</li></ul></li><li> The listing of animals under the United States' Endangered Species Act is a good example of this: "The employees in the Office of Endangered Species proceeded by listing the species that they liked best despite the prescription against ranking in the Act. A survey of their preferences demonstrated that they ranked mammals and birds above fish, amphibians, and reptiles, and these preferences reflect the rankings of which species are actually listed. The few listed arachnids suggests they have relatively few to champion their case for candidacy."
<ul><li> Sometimes wildlife conservation works this way; for example tigers are good poster animals, because when tiger habitats are preserved, rare snakes, spiders, and insects living in the same area are preserved as well, and people like animals such as tigers, polar bears, whales, etc. The panda is currently the most famous conservation icon due to its cuteness.
</li><li> In Conservation Biology, this trope is called a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_species">"Flagship species"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or an <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_species">"Umbrella species"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In Italy there was a scandal where the presenter of a TV show about cooking gave a recipe in which the main ingredient was cat meat. After a media kerfuffle the presenter was fired, eliciting responses of "Oh, so it's okay to eat chicken, rabbit, and beef, but cats are off-limits?"
</li><li> What is the difference between a rat and a hamster? Little, actually, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">the rat needs a new PR manager</a>.
<ul><li> Actually, they are actually very different - rats are both far more intelligent and far more social animals than hamsters, resulting in their ability to actually bond with human owners and see humans as playmates much like kittens do. Most domestic rats rarely bite unless severely frightened (the main exceptions are some pink-eyed rats who can't see well and are easily startled). Hamsters, on the other hand, rarely see humans as more than lumps to climb on and to bite any time they happen to get in the way. But because hamsters have rounder faces and fluffier fur (and no long, naked, semi-prehensile tail), they are the more popular pet.
</li><li> Same-sex hamsters will almost <em>always</em> fight each other to the death if confined together, even if they're littermates. Rats enjoy other rats' company, so don't do this if they're properly introduced to one another. But hamsters are still more popular.
</li><li> Similarly, the same logic would apply to things conventionally seen as pests, as, a lot of people will be quick to want to consider a hamster cute, while they'll be looking to be rid of rats and mice, much to the chagrin of anyone who owns either one of the latter.
</li><li> In a subversion, a 2019 story of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47370291">a fat rat caught in a manhole cover in Germany<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> went viral, with people identifying and sympathizing with the critter.
<div class="indent"><em>For Mr Sehr, however, there was no charge for the finder of this animal in distress - but he did receive a hand-drawn picture of the rat, surrounded by hearts, from the little girl who first found the distressed and squeaking creature.</em>
</div></li><li> Actually, some of what plays in to this is marketing. You see, years ago, scientists found out that hamsters weren't really good for experiments but things really take off in the 1940s, when some guy named Albert Marsh won one in a bet and came up with the idea to breed, sell, and write ads for them<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_Syrian_hamster#/media/File:Raise_hamsters_advertisement.jpg">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> There has apparently been talk about banning goldfish as pets in San Francisco due to them often being bred in unethical conditions or something along those lines. Whether you agree with the ban or not, you have to admit that the people's reactions have been telling of this trope. The worst comments claimed that they can't even feel pain, which has been scientifically proven wrong (and if it wasn't, you'd think the benefit of the doubt would go towards supposing that they can, to avoid possibly causing pain). Goldfish are generally often treated badly, for example kept in far too small bowls, again probably due to this trope. It's all too hard to make people understand that not only do they in fact have longer memories than 3 seconds (as busted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a>, among others), they are actually rather smart and can learn tricks and <em>even recognize humans by voice</em>.
</li><li> Another fish example are the species of tuna, many of which are being overfished into extinction. Meanwhile, what the general public worries about is that dolphins might be harmed as a side effect of tuna fishing.
<ul><li> Of course, another reason for this is that dolphins are many times more intelligent than tuna, and breed a lot more slowly, so aren't as able to replace their losses.
</li></ul></li><li> In America, opossums tend to get this treatment. Due to their vague resemblance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">that abhorred rodent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily">disturbing dentition</a>, they often get treated with much less respect and mercy than other native wildlife. Some people immediately conclude that an opossum is rabid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">because it's ugly</a>, even though their low body temperature makes them unlikely to catch the virus. An opossum living outside your house is usually harmless and sometimes even useful, as they eat many small pests. Admittedly they are rather dirty (and smelly) animals, but rarely carry any contagious diseases, to the point that wild opossum roadkills are usually <em>safe to eat</em> and there's a whole cuisine in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> around them. They have very little chance of hurting you, their best defense is to hiss and play dead. But they're uglier than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">raccoons and skunks</a>, so they must be evil!
</li><li> At one point, PETA campaigned to rename fish to "sea-kittens", the idea being if people compared fish to kittens, they would stop eating the former. This was eventually dropped. Part of why this didn't work is that Catfish are both caught and farmed for food. In some places, Catfish are a delicacy while in other places they are a dietary staple. A "sea-kitten" could refer to a juvenile Catfish that will be lunch when it grows up.
</li><li> Only cute reptiles like leopard geckos, bearded dragons, ball pythons and corn snakes are popular in the pet trade. Then again, they're also the hardiest, least costly and most laid-back in terms of temperament, so it's justified.
<ul><li> Tegus, particularly, seem to be actively working, as a species, towards defying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">Reptiles Are Abhorrent</a>; videos of them being quite affectionate and tame with their owners are commonplace.
</li><li> Monitor lizards as well (tegus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotWeasel">are not monitor lizards</a>). Even Komodo dragons in zoos have been known to get used to their keepers, and while most people who keep monitor lizards are more likely to think they're cool than cute, there are cute ones like ridge-tailed monitors, or "ackies" (<em>Varanus acanthurus</em>). The trouble is that even though they <em>can</em> be like scaly dogs under the right circumstances, if something goes wrong with a monitor lizard, Reptiles <em>really are</em> Abhorrent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Research before you get one, kids</a>.
</li><li> Frilled lizards are a subversion. They're supposed to look intimidating due to the cowl around their necks. Most people, however, find them charmingly awkward and cute. This is probably due to the fact that their defense mechanism is basically the lizard equivalent of a small child trying to pass off an inflatable sword as a weapon and when that doesn't work it typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">runs away</a> in the most <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-elqg3s97zc">hilariously adorable manner possible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Fully-domesticated pet animals (i.e. cats and dogs, rather than captive-bred-but-essentially-wild ones like reptiles and birds) exhibit neoteny, which is when they keep juvenile traits into adulthood. This is probably an effect of us looking after them - but it serves to make us want to look after them more, because babies are helpless and adorable. Similarly, domestication seems to select for more expressive, human-like faces - hence the eyebrow-like markings on many breeds of dogs. When it comes to our pets, we select for cute.
</li><li> Arthropods such as tarantulas and scorpions make for very inexpensive, low-maintenance pets that come in a wide variety of colors and are basically harmless (much less harmful than dogs or cats). This doesn't stop many people from thinking it's acceptable conversation to tell owners how gruesomely they want to kill their pets.
<ul><li> An exception is starting to be made for jumping spiders, which do appear conventionally "cute" because they are fuzzy and have giant eyes. It probably helps that no species of jumping spider has venom anywhere near harmful to humans and the vast majority are simply too small to even bite humans.
</li></ul></li><li> There have been incidents of certain individuals sharing videos online of themselves, or others, torturing insects (such as by gradually ripping off their legs). In some cases, people responding negatively to this were characterized as somehow perverse or deranged for being disturbed by it.
<ul><li> It probably also depends on the insect species in question. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video comment sections are anything to go by, people <strong>are</strong> indeed likely to react negatively to the mistreatment of insects... if the insect being mistreated is, say, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyButterflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyButterflies">butterfly</a>, a ladybug, a honeybee, or a firefly. Probably <em>not</em> coincidentally, these are also the insects that people tend to describe as 'cute'.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted with the subject of feathered dinosaurs; some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">less pleasant paleonuts</a> tend to devolve into cries of "science ruined dinosaurs!" when the topic is brought up and act as though being covered in fluffy feathers would somehow make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em> a complete wuss, despite it still having teeth like steak-knives, a biteforce stronger than any land animal in history, a tendency to eat triceratopses by ripping their heads off and possibly cannibalizing each other.
</li><li> In many a fandom, some fans tend to choose who their favorite character(s) are based on their physical appearance. This becomes a bit disturbing when you realize that the villain or rival of the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">is adored by more people than they should</a>. This becomes worse when we look at the less attractive <em>protagonist</em> characters, who are hated simply because they aren't cute. Simply put, to some fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">whether the character is good or evil is less important than how attractive they are</a>. It's especially jarring when the character(s) being bashed are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a>.
</li><li> Pigeons are often stereotyped as dirty, mindless city slickers despite being intelligent and affectionate. This is especially jarring because white doves are considered pure and good almost universally, despite the two birds being in the same family, with little difference between the two.
</li><li> Invasive Species:
<ul><li>A lot a nature conservation efforts tend to focus on deer, especially if there is an anti-hunting spin involved. While in someplace this is justified as there are threatened species of deer, in most instances trying to conserve deer populations is actually <em>harmful</em> to the environment. In many places the deer's natural predators have been eliminated, allowing them to breed until they have no food left and they starve.
</li><li> It can be really hard to mobilize a movement to combat an invasive species if that species happens to be cute (invasive deer species being a good example). It <em>can</em> be done though, as Australia's war against rabbits proves.
</li><li> This can be inverted if the invasive species started off as a pet or is thought of as one. One inversion is the green iguanas in Florida and many of the comments called for catch and relocate or catch and rehoming them, instead of culling. The case with the feral cats in the Australian Outback plays this straight but for those who don't live in Australia.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://uglyanimalsoc.com">Ugly Animal Preservation Society<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> averts this by fighting for the protection of endangered non-cute species. Their mascot is a <a class="urllink" href="https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2017/02/Blobfish-slime-carpet-surface.jpg.696x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg">blobfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinousHyena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinousHyena">Hyenas</a> have a very bad reputation in reality. It goes so far that even in fiction they are often portrayed as bad guys. They are perceived by most people as rather ugly, although there are more and more people who they like. They are also generally considered stupid because they are so scruffy and awkward, but in fact they are very intelligent animals. Hyenas are rarely kept in zoos because they are mostly unpopular with the guests, and are perceived as stupid, cruel, ugly and uninteresting.
<ul><li> In addition, they are considered the rivals of lions, and lions are among the most popular animals in the world. Actually, however, it is lions who steal prey more often from hyenas (and other predators), and not vice versa. Lions are also much more brutal than hyenas, and even harass or kill their food competitors.
</li><li> Kevin Richardson, also known as "Lion Whisperer", regularly releases videos on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, showing him hyenas, hoping that public opinion will change about them.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is unintentionally invoked any time a little kid is murdered and the media says something like "It's a shame such a beautiful little girl was murdered" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">so girls who are ugly deserve to be murdered then?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">There's more on the subject we're not going to say</a>.
