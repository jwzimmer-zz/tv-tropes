When fans asked her if she had written any doujinshi they might want to check out (not an unusual thing to ask a manga author, especially with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> heavy work like <em>Descendants of Darkness</em>) she was surprised and just wondered who'd spend their time (and money!) on producing doujinshi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em> is Izumi Matsumoto's only series. Everything else he's done have been one-shots.

<ul><li> Kazuhiro Ōyama storyboarded 9 episodes of the Pokemon Advance Generation anime, but he has no other credits to his name.
</li><li> The Pokemon XY episode Battling at Full Volume! was storyboarded by Kazuya Takahashi. This is his solo anime credit.

After he retired his comic strip in 1995 after a ten-year run, he released no other work, despite writing a few essays on sporadic special occasions. He's only made a couple of brief reappearances since retiring. The first was to write the introduction to the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CulDeSac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CulDeSac">Cul de Sac</a></em> collection and contributing an artwork to "Team Cul De Sac", a fundraising book for Parkinson's disease relief commissioned after Richard Thompson, the strip's creator, came down with the disease. He's also drawn panels for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Pearls Before Swine</a></em>, under the premise that a little girl tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersSuck">Stephen Pastis</a> that she can draw the strip better than he can, and turns out to be right. He also did the poster for <em>STRIPPED</em>, a documentary about comic strips for which he was interviewed.
</li><li> Gary Larson. Aside from a proto-version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide">The Far Side</a></em> that had a different name, the only thing of note that he's ever produced is <em>The Far Side</em>. After it finished its run, he retired and hasn't done much else except for a children's book.
</li><li> Kevin McCormick. His only credit as a professional cartoonist is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Arnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Arnold">Arnold</a></em>, which ran in newspapers from 1982 to 1988. After it ended he did some gag-writing on other strips but ultimately left cartooning and became a pastor.

While the film is today considered a classic, it did terribly when it was first released. Subsequently, Laughton was never given the chance to direct another film.

It was critically panned (but actually broke even at the box office, since it came out at the height of co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta">John Travolta</a>'s teen idol phase) and its poor reputation led Wagner to stick to a writing role for Tomlin's projects after that.

</li><li> John Kennedy Toole was a one-book author for awhile, but not even in his lifetime - he committed suicide before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em> was even published. After his mother died in 1989, however, publishers released his sole piece of juvenilia, <em>The Neon Bible</em>, a novel Toole wrote when he was 15. Oddly enough, despite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em> being far better known and acclaimed, <em>The Neon Bible</em> has had a film adaptation, whereas plans to adapt the former have never escaped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>—usually because the suitable leading men (<em>viz</em>, genuinely funny large comic actors) keep dying: first John Belushi, then John Candy, and then Chris Farley, were all set to play Ignatius J.

A theatrical adaptation was mounted in Boston in 2015, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickOfferman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickOfferman">Nick Offerman</a> as Reilly.

It was published to mostly good reviews and sales in 1948, but depression, writer's block and possibly a pan in <em>The New Yorker</em> drove him to suicide a few months after it was published. A decade later the novel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">adapted into a would-be epic film.</a>
</li><li> <em>Save Me The Waltz</em>, Zelda Fitzgerald's only novel. Her complete works, including the play, short stories, and magazine articles she wrote, still only fill a medium-sized paperback.
</li><li> Austin Tappan Wright's utopian novel <em>Islandia</em>. He worked on the project for years strictly as a hobby; a heavily-condensed version was published after his death in an automobile accident.

</li><li> Portuguese poet Cesário Verde only had one book published. This is because his poems read as modern ones and 19th century romantic society simply didn't like it.
</li><li> M.L. Humphreys. Some people believe that this was the pseudonym of a more-prolific author, but - in lieu of any hard evidence to support this - he (or she) fits under here. His/her only written work was a short story called <em>The Floor Above</em>, mainly remembered today because it was one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H.

</li><li> Science fiction/horror writer Bob Leman published short stories over a couple of decades, but his entire output is collected in the average sized short story collection <em>Feesters in the Lake &amp; Other Stories</em>, which is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">almost impossible to find</a> due to its publisher going under.

His second book, <em>Imaginary Friend</em>, wouldn't release until twenty years after <em>Wallflower.</em>
</li><li> While Jaroslav Haek's body of work is qute extensive, he was primarily a journalist, and his legacy mainly consist of newspaper articles and short stories. His only novel, a satirical anti-war epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodSoldierSvejk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodSoldierSvejk">The Good Soldier vejk</a></em>, was only half finished at moment of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">author's death from tuberculosis</a> at the age of just 39.
</li><li> French author Alain-Fournier published his only novel, <em>Le Grand Meaulnes</em> (released in English translation as <em>The Wanderer</em> and <em>The Lost Domain</em>, among other titles) a year before he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">killed in action</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">World War One</a>.

</li><li> Harry F. Saint worked on Wall Street as he decided to write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAnInvisibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAnInvisibleMan">Memoirs of an Invisible Man</a></em>. Saint was considering becoming a full-time writer, but apparently just resting on all the cash his book made (just the film rights were $1.3 million) seemed better. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.noblemania.com/2016/03/memory-of-invisible-man.html">Even learning where the guy wound up is hard.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Jim Theis is only known for writing the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> fantasy novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyeOfArgon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyeOfArgon">The Eye of Argon</a></em> at the age of 16. It was his only book, since the book's infamy ruined his reputation, causing him to refuse writing anything else until his death in 2002.

</li><li> Keri Hulme, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealander</a> to win the Booker Prize, has to date published only one novel, <em>The Bone People</em>. Other than that, she is mostly a poet and short story writer.
</li><li> Collections of his screenplays have been published, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlteredStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlteredStates">Altered States</a></em> (1978) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaddyChayefsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaddyChayefsky">Paddy Chayefsky</a>'s only novel.
</li><li> Henry Roth wrote the classic <em>Call It Sleep</em> in the 1930s, and then nothing else for decades. (Then he wrote a series called <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream.</em>)
</li><li> T.E.D. Klein published a single novel - <em>The Ceremonies</em>. He did start a second novel in the eighties and hopes to complete it.
</li><li> Mary Elizabeth Frye is a one-poem author. She wrote the poem "Do Not Stand on My Grave and Weep" in a moment of inspiration on a brown shopping bag to console a Jewish friend who could not visit her dying mother in Germany due to anti-Semitic unrest. The poem has become a classic at funerals, particularly for those without a grave to mourn at. Frye never published the poem herself, and it's the only poem of hers to receive any circulation.
</li><li> A more grim example comes in the form of Mendal W. Johnson. While writing his first book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LetsGoPlayAtTheAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LetsGoPlayAtTheAdams">Let's Go Play at the Adams'</a></em>, Johnson, originally a recovering alcoholic, took up drinking again because of the book's extremely bleak look on the nature of human cruelty putting a toll on his mental state. Johnson would end up dying two years after the novel's publication in 1976 from cirrhosis of the liver, making <em>Let's Go Play</em> the only book he ever wrote before his untimely death.

It is the closest thing to a Jones solo project (though he was only involved as sound recorder and album engineer), and the album remains an influential in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic">World Music</a> genre.
</li><li> Skip Spence, whose album <em>Oar</em> was released in 1969. He was a prominent member of the psychedelic band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MobyGrape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MobyGrape">Moby Grape</a> who turned out to be the American equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a>. He weirded out his bandmates by indulging in LSD and attacking someone with a fire axe. He got institutionalized, recorded <em>Oar,</em> and dropped out of the public life until his death in 1999.

Aside from a mixtape tribute to Aretha Franklin, their <em>Black Star</em> album is their only proper release.
</li><li> Scott La Rock, DJ of rap duo Boogie Down Productions, was involved in only one album, <em>Criminal Minded</em>, which was their debut. He was murdered a few months after the album was released. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KRSOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KRSOne">KRS-One</a>, the remaining member, continued Boogie Down Productions without him. Much of the songs made after La Rock's murder, such as "Stop The Violence," had anti-violence messages which contrasted with the proto-gangsta rap lyrics of <em>Criminal Minded</em>, made before La Rock was murdered.
</li><li> Chris Bell, founding member of 1970s power pop legends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar">Big Star</a>, released one single in his lifetime, "I Am the Cosmos" with "You and Your Sister" as its B-side. Bell was poised to develop a solo career when his life was cut short by a tragic car accident in 1978. The single, along with the work of Big Star, developed a cult following in the 1980s and there was enough demand for a release of a complete discography of Bell's solo work in 1992, also called <em>I Am The Cosmos</em>. The album consists of the aforementioned single along with unreleased songs and demos.
</li><li> The Faders, an all-girl British pop-rock band, had a minor hit with "No Sleep Tonight", which was all over the place after its release as a single, and featured in a number of advertisements, films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSisterhoodOfTheTravelingPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSisterhoodOfTheTravelingPants">The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesTheMan">She's the Man</a></em> (both times in soccer scenes, weirdly enough), and in shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek">Greek</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush">Sugar Rush</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, where the band appeared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Themselves</a>.

Lead singer Gregg Alexander, a singer-songwriter known for his mixture of catchiness and cynicism, released two albums beforehand before forming the New Radicals. He split up the band as he was gaining fame (hurting the performance of second single "Someday We'll Know", which still gained some fame due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">a version featured in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember">A Walk to Remember</a></em>), becoming a professional songwriter for other artists, his most notable song being "You Get What You Give" soundalike "Game of Love" for Santana and Michelle Branch. Ironically, while "Game" became a much bigger hit than "Give" was, the latter is better remembered today.
<ul><li> This is an interesting example because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewRadicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewRadicals">New Radicals</a> kept changing lineup, the only members consistent throughout the whole time were Gregg Alexander and Danielle Brisebois. Danielle released two solo albums featuring Gregg Alexander as co-writer and guest performer on almost every track, meaning that they are technically also New Radicals albums. Rick Nowels co-wrote most New Radicals songs, however, despite not actually being a member of the band, so take from that what you will.
</li></ul></li><li> Minuteflag, a supergroup composed of LA punk legends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Minutemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Minutemen">Minutemen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackFlag">Black Flag</a>, released one self-titled EP of mostly instrumental tunes. They made a pact to release the collaboration as soon as one of the bands broke up. Sadly, it was released after Minutemen broke up due to the tragic death of leader D. Boon. The EP, released in 1986, remains out of print.
</li><li> The Glove, a supergroup consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a> singer Robert Smith, Siouxsie and the Banshees bassist Steve Severin, and singer Jeannete Landray, released one album, <em>Blue Sunshine</em>.
<ul><li> Another short-lived Cure side-project was Cult Hero, consisting of the members of The Cure c. 1979, various members of Smith's family, a couple members of local bands (including future Cure members Matthieu Hartley and Simon Gallup and former member Porl Thompson (he'd later rejoin the band)) and Smith's postman, Frank Bell on vocals. The group was supposedly formed see how well Gallup would gel with the other members of The Cure. After one single, 1979's "I'm A Cult Hero"/"I Dig You", Cult Hero disbanded and never recorded a thing again.
</li></ul></li><li> Seattle band Mother Love Bone released one EP and one LP, later compiled to one album. The band, destined to help lead the up-and-coming grunge movement of the 1990s, fizzled after singer Andrew Wood fatally overdosed in 1990. After Wood died, Soundgarden members Chris Cornell and Matt Cameron, who were good friends with Andrew Wood, partnered with singer Eddie Vedder and MLB members Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard to release one self-titled album as Temple of the Dog as a tribute to Wood, featuring hits such as "Hunger Strike" and "Say Hello 2 Heaven." As the album was being recorded and released, Ament, Gossard, and Vedder formed their own band, Pearl Jam, and Temple of the Dog broke up, with both respective bands skyrocketing to success on their own. After the success of Mother Love Bone and Temple of the Dog, Wood's earlier band, Malfunkshun, had all its songs compiled to one posthumous release, <em>Return to Olympus</em>.
</li><li> Splendora, an all-girl 90s grunge group notable for singing the theme song to <em>Daria</em>, only ever produced one album, <em>In the Grass</em>. They did later reunite to create songs for the two <em>Daria</em> TV Movies, "Turn the Sun Down" and "College Try".
</li><li> <em>Girls Talk</em>, released in the spring of 1991, was the only proper full-length album from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyGirl">ultra-girly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> The Rebel Pebbles. Aside from a three-song EP prior to the album, they released absolutely nothing else.
</li><li> <em>Above</em>, the lone album by grunge supergroup Mad Season. The band's singer was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a>' Layne Staley, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">his 2002 death, along with the bassist's 1999 death</a>, ended any chance of a second album.
</li><li> Ashley Jade's <em>Dreaming</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">following her tenure with Soda Club</a>, was her only solo album. It is unlikely she will ever return to the spotlight.
</li><li> Forest For The Trees' self-titled album, which itself was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> that almost never saw the light of day due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Carl Stephenson</a> having a nervous breakdown. There is the somewhat hard to find EP <em>Sounds Of Wet Paint</em>, which combined remixes with a few outtakes from the debut, and a second album was reportedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode">finished but never released.</a>
</li><li> The Eurodance/trance duo Trouser Enthusiasts produced countless remixes, but "Sweet Release" was their only original production, after which they disbanded.
</li><li> Jai Paul, so far, made one album of demos that was illegally leaked on Bandcamp before they were shelved by the artist. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">For several years, the critically-acclaimed demos have been widely available online</a> before XL Recordings properly released the album, with two new songs, in 2019.
</li><li> Jumalatar only produced two EP's, <em>Are We Thinking the Same Thing</em> and <em>Frenzy</em>, before parting ways. The "Song Samples" track on the former implies that they planned to release a full-length album, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">but it never came to fruition.</a>
</li><li> Singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey released his debut album in 1972, and has never released anything else, even though he's still an active performer with a cult following. Supposedly whenever anyone asks him why he hasn't released another album he says "What was wrong with the first one?" One of the songs on the album was "Muskrat Love" (originally called "Muskrat Candlelight"). Luckily for Ramsey, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> <em>and</em> became a big hit, so he can collect royalty money while the rest of the world thinks of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> as a Captain &amp; Tennille song.
</li><li> Carole King's band The City released one album, <em>Now That Everything's Been Said</em> (1968), before they broke up and she embarked on a solo career.
</li><li> Thorr's Hammer was a doom metal band from Washington State whose singer was a teenage exchange student named Runhild Gammelsæter. They were active for six weeks, releasing one cassette called <em>Dommedagsnatt</em>, before the singer returned home to Norway. The rest of the band, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, continued as Burning Witch before becoming drone titans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunnO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunnO">Sunn O)))</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a> led two supergroups after the breakup of his band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream">Cream</a>. The first, Blind Faith, released one self-titled album with six songs in it. After Blind Faith fell apart, Clapton led <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DerekAndTheDominos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DerekAndTheDominos">Derek and the Dominos</a>, recording <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaylaAndOtherAssortedLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaylaAndOtherAssortedLoveSongs">Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs</a></em>. Though the album and especially the title track are now considered classics, on its initial release the critical and commercial reaction was moderate at best; a year later, Duane Allman (not an official member of the band but an important contributor to <em>Layla</em>; most notably, he helped to create the famous opening guitar riff from the title track) died in a motorcycle accident, exacerbating Clapton's substance abuse issues, and Derek and the Dominoes subsequently dissolved during an attempt to record a second album.
</li><li> Scottish band Life Without Buildings released one album, 'Any Other City', before breaking up.
</li><li> The 1998 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace">Band Minus the Face</a> reformation of 2 Unlimited only did one album, <em>II</em>.
</li><li> The band Reunion released one song, "Life is a Rock (but the Radio Rolled Me)," and absolutely nothing else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GuitarRomantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GuitarRomantic">Guitar Romantic</a></em> is the sole album by critically acclaimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> revivalists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheExplodingHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheExplodingHearts">The Exploding Hearts</a>. Three-fourths of the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">died in a tour van accident</a> a few months after its release, effectively ending the band.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace">Grace</a></em> is the lone studio album by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley">Jeff Buckley</a> before his death. He was recording a second, <em>My Sweetheart The Drunk</em>, but he drowned in the Mississippi River before the recording sessions had even reached the halfway point. The unfinished material did get released as <em>Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk</em>, however.
</li><li> "Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight", the sole single of Dominatrix.
</li><li> Another one single band would be The Normal (who were really a solo project by Daniel Miller) - not counting an improvised live collaboration with Robert Rental, the only release was the single <em>T.V.O.D. \ Warm Leatherette</em>. Miller has had other musical projects, but is now mainly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a>. The lone single was pretty influential to such genres as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> and electroclash - "Warm Leatherette" in particular gets covered a lot.
</li><li> After a turbulent career filled with constant recording and re-recording of their debut album, scrapping sessions with famous producers like Mike Hedges, John Leckie and John Porter before settling on Steve Lillywhite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas">The La's</a> managed to produce one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a> before collapsing due to Lee Mavers' insane perfectionism.
</li><li> The band Lincoln released a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a> in 1997 and became an opening act for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a>. After they broke up in 1998 without releasing a follow-up, guitarist Dan Miller and bassist Danny Weinkauf joined TMBG's backing band and have been there ever since.
</li><li> Early 90s Britpop band Starclub had a Top 10 US alt-rock radio hit, "Hard To Get", but broke up after only one album.
</li><li> 1970s power-pop trio The Nerves released one four-song EP and broke up shortly after. Blondie released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">their own cover version of "Hanging on the Telephone,"</a> and two of the members founded the Plimsouls, scoring an 80s hit with "A Million Miles Away."
</li><li> A banker named Stuart Gorrell wrote the lyrics for his old college buddy Hoagy Carmichael's song "Georgia on My Mind". It was his only songwriting credit. The royalty money Gorrell earned for "Georgia" was enough to put his daughter through college.
</li><li> The widely-covered "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" (most famously done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>) is literally the only song ever written by its writer, Bill Trader.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>' "Gonna Take a Lot of River" was not the only song written by John Kurhajetz (ASCAP lists four other works), but it was the only one anyone recorded.
</li><li> <em>Colossal Youth</em> was the sole album release by influential minimalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> trio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoungMarbleGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoungMarbleGiants">Young Marble Giants</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Grand Pecking Order</em> by Oysterhead, the short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">Supergroup</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish">Trey Anastasio</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus">Les Claypool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">Stewart Copeland</a>.
</li><li> Despite having various singles recorded under different aliases (such as Loose Joints and 1-800-DINOSAUR), as well as a massive collection of posthumous recordings, <em>World of Echo</em> is the only full-length album that experimental musician Arthur Russell completed and released during his lifetime.
</li><li> Another supergroup who only managed one album was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">Billy Corgan</a>'s Zwan, who released their sole album, <em>Mary Star of the Sea</em> in 2003 and broke up later that year.
</li><li> Another one for the list of rapidly-disintegrating supergroups is Freebass, the collaboration between Peter Hook (New Order), Gary Mountfield (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStoneRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStoneRoses">The Stone Roses</a>) and Andy Rourke (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a>). The group had already fallen apart and announced their split before their sole album, <em>It's A Beautiful Life</em>, came out in 2010.
</li><li> The International Submarine Band released their debut <em>Safe at Home</em>, generally considered the first country rock album, in 1968. They broke up a few months later after leader Gram Parsons left to join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a>.
</li><li> R&amp;B duo Damian Dame is a tragic example. Damian Dame, a duo consisting of "Damian" Broadus and "de Dame" Debra Jean Hurd, released their self-titled debut on LaFace Records in 1991. On June 27, 1994, before the two would work on a second album, "deah Dame" was killed in a moped accident. Damian would perish from colon cancer exactly two years later.
</li><li> The California <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkaPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkaPunk">Ska Punk</a> band Suburban Rhythm, who were a major influence on subsequent popular groups in the Orange County scene such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime">Sublime</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish">Reel Big Fish</a>, only had one album, a compilation which was released three years <em>after</em> they broke up.
</li><li> It's hard to tell whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobDougan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobDougan">Rob Dougan</a> is one of these or not, considering that he appears to be a rather slow worker anyway. It took him seven years from the release of the single "Clubbed To Death" in 1995 to complete and release the accompanying full-length album <em>Furious Angels</em>. The album came out in 2002, in 2003 he contributed one new track to the soundtrack of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded">The Matrix Reloaded</a></em> and did the string arrangement for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes">Sugababes</a> single. There has been nothing heard from him since up to mid-2014, and given that he could probably retire on the royalties from "Clubbed To Death" alone, it's easy to suspect that he's chosen to do exactly that.
</li><li> The origins of outsider musician Y. Bhekhirst are shrouded in mystery, but only one album, Hot in the Airport, was ever released by him, and even then it wasn't commercially sold. There are indications that he recorded many songs as he copyrighted a lot, but it has yet to be heard and remains so reclusive nobody knows what he looks like.
</li><li> American surf band The Avalanches (no relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAvalanches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAvalanches">the Australian electronic group that released two albums</a>, but were named after the surf band) released only one album, <em>Ski Surfin' with the Avalanches</em>, in 1963. That group was one of those "studio-only" bands made up of professional session musicians that were prolific in the 1960's.
</li><li> "Music Sounds Better With You" by Stardust, a one-shot project from Thomas Bangalter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaftPunk">Daft Punk</a> fame. It was never intended to have a following single, indeed this "dream team" of French electronic wizards never worked together again.
</li><li> Rapeman was a noise-rock supergroup active for a very brief time in the late 1980s. Its members were Steve Albini (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBlack">Big Black</a>, and later Shellac), David Wm. Sims (Scratch Acid) and Rey Washam (big Boys and Scratch Acid). Their complete discography consists of their lone LP <em>Two Nuns and a Pack Mule</em>, an EP called <em>Budd</em> (included in full on the CD reissue of <em>Two Nuns</em>) and two 7'' singles.
</li><li> <em>The Golden Year</em> is the only album released by British electronic rock band Ou Est Le Swimming Pool. The band folded shortly after its release due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">suicide of their lead singer</a> Charles Haddon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">who killed himself jumping from a mast at the 2010 Pukkelpop Festival</a> earlier in the year.
</li><li> Country music band Hot Apple Pie, fronted by former Little Texas keyboardist Brady Seals, broke up in 2005 after only one album due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksRecords">DreamWorks Records</a> closing up shop. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MCA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MCA">MCA</a> shipped two singles off the album, but neither went anywhere.) However, Seals has continued to record solo, and sometimes uses ex-Hot Apple Pie members on his solo work.
</li><li> Also affected by the closing of DreamWorks Records was Hanna-McEuen (first cousins Jaime Hanna and Jonathan McEuen, whose fathers co-founded the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band). They were barely two singles into their debut album, and no other label picked them up. Hanna joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan">Gary Allan</a>'s road band, and McEuen went solo.
</li><li> And speaking of Little Texas, former lead singer Tim Rushlow managed to be a part of this trope <em>three</em> times after leaving that band. (They broke up and reunited without him or Seals.) Tim did a solo album for Atlantic Records, which was blunted after the Top 10 hit "She Misses Him" due to that label closing its country division. In 2003, he and cousin Doni Harris formed a six-piece band called Rushlow, which cut only one album for Lyric Street; said album got "I Can't Be Your Friend" into top 20, but label restructuring prevented any more hits, and the band broke up. Rushlow and Harris cut two low-charting singles for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith">Toby Keith</a>'s Show Dog label in 2006 under the name Rushlow Harris before splitting again. (As for the other four members of Rushlow? Billy Welch is now in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen">Jake Owen</a>'s road band, while Kurt Alison, Tully Kennedy, and Rich Redmond are now in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean">Jason Aldean</a>'s road band.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2hor4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2hor4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2hor4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They, along with bandmate David Fanning, also produce under the name New Voice Entertainment.</span>)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill">Lauryn Hill</a> only released 2 albums, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMiseducationOfLaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMiseducationOfLaurynHill">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</a></em> and <em>MTV Unplugged 2.0</em>, and the latter was a live recording. Only her first album received overall acclaim, and after that album, she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> and left the public eye.
</li><li> The German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Industrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Industrial">industrial</a> group Microchip League (MCL) only produced one studio album, <em>Code Numbers</em>, although in 2009, more than two decades later, they released a compilation of previously unreleased tracks, titled <em>Raw Tapes</em>.
</li><li> Country music singer Cyndi Thomson quit after her first album for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords">Capitol Records</a> because she didn't think she could handle the pressure of a second album. As a result, she remains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> with her #1 country hit "What I Really Meant to Say". However, she also wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan">Gary Allan</a>'s "Life Ain't Always Beautiful".
</li><li> Country band The Buffalo Club didn't even last the entirety of 1997. Their membership was former Christian singer Ron Hemby, Doug Stone's former touring guitarist Charlie Kelly, and then-former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RestlessHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RestlessHeart">Restless Heart</a> drummer John Dittrich, the last of whom quit before their third and final single. Soon afterward, their label closed and Dittrich rejoined Restless Heart.
</li><li> Another group whose existence fell entirely within the year 1997, and whose membership included former members of other country bands, was Burnin' Daylight. Their members were Kurt Howell (Southern Pacific) and Sonny LeMaire (Exile), with Nashville songwriter Marc Beeson on lead vocals. After they broke up, LeMaire and Beeson continued to focus on songwriting, while Howell became a sales director at an audio technology company.
</li><li> Cellsite System, a Portland, Oregon based trance project, only made two albums, <em>Between Frequencies</em> and <em>Mind Into Matter</em>, the latter being a multimedia album. The website is long gone, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">good luck finding the albums</a>.
</li><li> "Pump Up the Volume" was a worldwide top 10 smash in 1987, and a major influence on later examples of sampling in pop music (as well as electronic music as a whole). It was also the only single ever released by M|A|R|R|S, a collaboration between two artists on the independent record label 4AD (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamPop">Dream Pop</a> duo AR Kane and dance group Colourbox - the legal problems surrounding the record led to the former leaving the label and the latter splitting up).
</li><li> "Carte Blanche", plus its B-side "Drafting", was the only original material by Veracocha, a one-off collaboration between Ferry Corsten and Vincent de Moor, although they did at least one remix (Ayla - Ayla).
</li><li> Brazilian satirical band Mamonas Assassinas recorded only one album (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">which is one of the best-selling of all time in the country, mind you</a>) before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">dying in a plane crash</a>.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> example is Caitlin &amp; Will. They won the first season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT">CMT</a>'s singing competition <em>Can You Duet</em>, released one single ("Address in the Stars") and an EP, and broke up once the single fell from the charts.
</li><li> Tommy Shane Steiner released one album, <em>Then Came the Night</em>, in 2002. Lead single "What If She's an Angel" was a top-5 hit on the country charts, but his only other two singles bombed and he was never heard from again.
</li><li> Also from 2002 is Brad Martin, who released <em>Wings of a Honky-Tonk Angel</em>. Lead single "Before I Knew Better" was a modest hit, but a planned second album never came to be. Martin later joined songwriter John Ramey in the duo Martin Ramey in 2008, who quietly released two singles before disappearing.
</li><li> Clay Davidson released his debut album <em>Unconditional</em> in 2000 and had a top-3 hit on Hot Country Songs with the title track. He never released another album, due in part to his label (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords">Virgin Records</a>) undergoing a merger and a tour-bus accident that hampered his ability to keep touring.
</li><li> <em>Lies</em> appears to be all we'll hear from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop">synthpop</a> duo Heartbreak, although Ali Renault has a solo album, and Muravchik, under the alias Anthonio, released an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerSong">Answer Song</a> single to Annie(Anne Lilia Berge-Strand)'s "Anthonio" titled "Annie".
</li><li> The psychedelica band <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel_%28band%29">Uriel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> only recorded and released one album—a self-titled album that was named while the band was using an alias, no less! The album, <em>Arzachel</em>, was released in 1969 and became a long sought-after collector's item for psychedelica enthusiasts; its sole (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">legal</a>) re-release in 2007 sold out almost immediately.
</li><li> Country music band Cole Deggs &amp; the Lonesome broke up after only one album.
</li><li> Songwriter Jonathan Singleton founded a band in 2009 called Jonathan Singleton &amp; the Grove. They released two singles: "Livin' in Paradise" and "Look Who's Back in Love". The latter was included on a full album, with the Grove disbanding immediately afterward and Singleton returning to songwriting.
</li><li> Blue County was a one-off collaboration between Aaron Benward (formerly of father-and-son Christian music duo Aaron Jeoffrey) and Scott Reeves (who is mainly a soap actor). They did one album, and after a couple followup singles went nowhere, disbanded.
</li><li> Similarly, The Wreckers was a one-off between solo artists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichelleBranch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichelleBranch">Michelle Branch</a> and Jessica Harp. They did guest vocals on a David Santana song, recorded one album, and broke up before recording another.
</li><li> Yet another country example: the JaneDear girls split up after only one album.
</li><li> The Age of Love was a one-off supergroup consisting of Bruno Sanchioni and Giuseppe Chierchia; their self-titled single is considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">one of the first proper trance tracks</a>. Sanchioni later founded the trio BBE of "7 Days &amp; One Week" fame, as well as collaborating with many others.
</li><li> In the 1980s, Nashville songwriters Bob DiPiero and John Scott Sherrill formed a country music band called Billy Hill, in which they alternated as lead vocalists (both in the guise of the a fictional character also named Billy Hill) with backing from former Detroit Wheels member Dennis Robbins, former Steve Earle bassist Reno Kling, and session drummer Martin Parker. They did one album for Reprise and broke up before a second was completed, although one of the tracks from the second ("The Church on Cumberland Road") was later a #1 for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>'s 1994 single "I'll Never Forgive My Heart" is the only writing credit for duo member Ronnie Dunn's wife, Janine.
</li><li> Chagall Guevara was a band formed by several veterans of the early Christian alternative music scene (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveTaylor">Steve Taylor</a>) in an attempt to break through to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">not-quite-as-limiting</a> mainstream secular alt-rock world. The band's 1991 self-titled album failed to catch on with alternative rock fans or radio, despite being critically acclaimed. It has, at best, become a minor cult item with fans of early 90's alternative rock. However, the album became fairly popular with Christian rock fans despite the fact that there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock">very few things that could be considered overtly Christian</a> on the album, nor was the CCM market ever planned to be the target audience - its popularity likely having to do with the backgrounds of the performers (particularly the wildly successful Taylor). The group broke up in 1993 without making another album.
</li><li> Fockewolf, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Industrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Industrial">Industrial</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWave">Dark Wave</a> side project/supergroup consisting of Rob Wilhelm of Noxious Emotion and vocalist Severina X Sol, only released one demo cassette EP, <em>Dominus et Deus</em>, and one album, <em>Die Toten Weg</em>, although Severina went on to perform with Cylab and The Break Up. Wilhelm also made a cameo appearance on the former's <em>Satellites</em> album.
<ul><li> In addition, Back And To The Left, a Future Pop act founded by Wilhelm and the other former NE members, also only produced one album, 2005's <em>Obsolete</em>, before themselves disbanding the following year.
</li></ul></li><li> Metal supergroup Damageplan only released one album <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">before disbanding</a>.
</li><li> "Outta Sight", circa 2009, is so far the only single released by New Zealand singer Kelly Rose (not to be confused with others of the same name).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Runforyerlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Runforyerlife">Runforyerlife</a>, a third-wave ska band from Chicago, only released one album in 1999 before falling off the face of the earth.
</li><li> To My Surprise, an experimental rock side project of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slipknot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slipknot">Slipknot</a> founder Shawn Crahan, only released one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a> in 2003 before disbanding three years later.
</li><li> Seminal Depressive/Suicidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> band Silencer only ever made one album, 2001's <em>Death - Pierce Me</em>. The institutionalisation of vocalist Nattramn shortly after the recording of the album is almost certainly the reason for this.
</li><li> "Nightshade" and "I Wanna Be Your Star" were the only singles recorded by Melody &amp; Mezzo before they permanently split up, although producer J-Mi later collaborated with Midi-D and Smile.dk.
</li><li> Stars on 54, a trio effort between Ultra Nate, Amber, and Jocelyn Enriquez, covered "If You Could Read My Mind" for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyFour">54</a></em> soundtrack, and never collaborated again.
</li><li> Another one-single collaboration was "So Deep" by Silvertear, produced by Pascal Schutters, Jonas Steur, and Christophe and Erik from Ian Van Dahl. Best known for its appearance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> series.
</li><li> Obscure rap group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Ninja High School</a> only did one album, <em>Young Adults Against Suicide</em>, as well as some singles and extended plays, before dropping off the face of the Earth.
</li><li> 1990s dance experimentalists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDove">One Dove</a> were lauded in the British music press but released only one album,<em>Morning Dove White</em>. Reports vary on how close to a releaseable state the follow-up reached before they decided they'd had enough of the label's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and split.
</li><li> Cult Midwest Emo band Cap'n Jazz only released one full length LP <em>Shmap'n Shmazz</em>, along with a scattering amount of compilation appearances and 2 EPs, before splitting up right after the release of the LP in 1995. Their entire discography, minus a few early tracks, were collected into a single compilation <em>Analphabetapolothology</em> in 1998.
<ul><li> This is usually typical of 90s Emo bands. One of the side project of Cap'n Jazz, cult Indie Rock group American Football, also only released a single LP, along with an EP, both self-titled. Though American Football managed to last a bit longer than Cap'n Jazz, breaking up in a few years after the release of their LP without releasing a follow-up. American Football later reunited and released their second, also self-titled, album.
</li></ul></li><li> German darkwave duo Electronic Suicide produced but one promo CD EP (i.e. not released to the public), featuring the songs <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjTVFZA7fZI">"Ich Wollt"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf7oO0zBqFY">"Fear"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3X9MzCEANA">"Wild Kisses"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then went their separate ways.
</li><li> Kandystand only managed to produce one full-length album, <em>Watch Out, Here I Come</em>. They broke up due to a dispute shortly after releasing the stand-alone single "Love Invasion".
</li><li> Team Sleep, an experimental rock band formed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deftones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deftones">Deftones</a> frontman Chino Moreno only released one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a> in 2005, before going on an indefinite hiatus due to Chino's commitment to his main band.
</li><li> Egg Hunt were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinorThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinorThreat">Minor Threat</a> offshoot who released one single with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> (It was technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">self-titled single</a>, but it's been variously referred to as <em>Me And You</em>, <em>Me And You / We All Fall Down</em> or <em>2 Songs</em>): Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson spontaneously founded the project when they were visiting England and the owner of a studio invited them to do some recording, and the band name was chosen because the single was recorded over Easter weekend. Plans were made to expand Egg Hunt from a duo to a full band when the two returned to America, but soon after a full band version was put together for rehearsals, Ian started focusing much more on the newly-formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fugazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fugazi">Fugazi</a>. The rest of the full-band incarnation of Egg Hunt replaced him with Mark Haggerty and became Three, who also became a one album band, breaking up a year before their album <em>Dark Days Coming</em> was even released. MacKaye and Nelson would never end up working together directly on any further musical projects.
</li><li> Negative Entropy, a Dutch ambient noise supergroup. Two albums, both limited production runs, of 1000 and 488 copies, respectively. The death of Geert Feytons in 2006 sealed the project's fate for good.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> Sarina Paris's self-titled album is her only full-length, although she later produced a couple stand-alone singles.
</li><li> Eclectic country rock band Quacky Duck &amp; His Barnyard Friends released their only album, <em>Media Push</em>, in 1974. They had an interesting lineup, though: Tony Bennett's two sons (Danny and Daegal); David Mansfield, who later worked with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> and Bruce Hornsby and scored numerous films; and Gordon Javna, who went on to write the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader">Uncle John's Bathroom Reader</a></em> books.
</li><li> Vicious Pink's only album was their self-titled album. They were also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> with "Cccant You See?".
</li><li> Ty England's 1995 debut single "Should've Asked Her Faster" was the only writing credit for songwriter Joe Klimek.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a>'s 2001 single "Tell Her" was co-written by someone named "Kwesi B." (real name: Mark McClendon), who has only one other entry in ASCAP's database which was apparently not recorded by anyone (or if they did, it's so obscure that not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Google</a> can find it).
</li><li> Obscure 90s country music singer Daron Norwood had an unknown person named Jeff Carlton produce both of his albums, albeit in collaboration with more famous producers: James Stroud on the first, and Richard Landis on the second. Carlton also produced Curtis Wright's debut album <em>Slick Hick</em>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">it was never released</a>.
<ul><li> Speaking of Norwood, his 1995 single "Bad Dog, No Biscuit" was written by one Richard Ferrell, who has no other entries on BMI. (He is not to be confused with <em>Rick</em> Ferrell, a more prolific songwriter.)
</li></ul></li><li> The originator of the much-covered disco classic "Saturday", Norma Jean Wright is still touring regularly and doing guest spots on other people's records, but 1978's <em>Norma Jean</em> remains her only solo album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> duo Steel Magnolia, who won the second season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT">CMT</a>'s <em>Can You Duet</em> singing competition, broke up after only one album (and one EP). "Broke up" in the literal sense, as they were also boyfriend and girlfriend, so they terminated their relationship and musical partnership concurrently. Linsey has since competed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>.
</li><li> Another country example is Edens Edge. After one album, lead singer Hannah Blaylock quit in March 2013. The label dropped them in lieu of releasing a third single, and the other two members appear to have done a few random shows before the band's website was taken down in late 2013.
</li><li> Songwriter-producer Ray Methvin has only one notable credit in either field: as a songwriter, his only single cut was "Gravitational Pull" by Chris LeDoux, and as a producer, his only album was Jenny Simpson's 1998 debut (co-produced by Garth Fundis).
</li><li> Connie Converse, a folk singer-songwriter who played around New York in the 50s and early 60s, has only one album's worth of songs, <em>How Sad, How Lovely</em>, released in 2009. Since this album was compiled from archival recordings by two fans 35 years after Converse disappeared, never to be seen again, it's iffy to even say that it was released during her lifetime.
</li><li> While songwriter/producer Eric Pittarelli had a couple other obscure cuts, his only production credit was Bomshel's 2006 EP <em>Bomshel Stomp</em>. The track "19 and Crazy" on Bomshel's <em>Fight Like a Girl</em> is likewise the only production credit for prominent Nashville songwriters Mark Irwin and Josh Kear.
</li><li> The sole discography of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortLivedBigImpact">influential</a> American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weakling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weakling">Weakling</a> is two rehearsal tapes and 2000's album <em>Dead as Dreams</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor">Fort Minor</a>, the hip-hop based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject">Solo Side Project</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>'s Mike Shinoda, only released one album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRisingTied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRisingTied">The Rising Tied</a></em> in 2005. In 2006, the project went on hiatus which, as of 2015, still hasn't ended.
</li><li> Rapper Kreayshawn released four mixtapes, but her only album release was <em>Somethin' 'Bout Kreay</em> in 2012. Sales of the album were absolutely dismal, only charting at #112 with sales of 3900 copies. The fact her label decided to release the physical copy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">exclusively to Hot Topic</a> might have had something to do with it. Since then, she's appeared as a guest rapper on a number of other artists' songs, but there have been practically no talks of another album.
</li><li> American-British-Canadian five-piece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> G.R.L. was formed by veteran choreographer Robin Antin with the intention of finding a replacement for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePussycatDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePussycatDolls">The Pussycat Dolls</a>. Unfortunately, they were only able to release their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled EP</a> in July of 2014. Not long afterwards, member Simone Battle tragically died from an apparent suicide for reasons unknown. They continued as a four-piece for a while, and released the single "Lighthouse" as a tribute to her, but ultimately decided to disband in June 2015.
</li><li> R&amp;B group L.A.X. Gurlz released one song, "Forget You", in 2007 before breaking up afterwards and thus vanishing completely. Their debut album failed to surface thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> of Blackground Records.
</li><li> Wilbur C. Rimes produced the first few albums of his daughter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes">LeAnn Rimes</a>, but had exactly one other production credit: Steve Holy's 2000 debut <em>Blue Moon</em>. Holy's second and third albums, <em>Brand New Girlfriend</em> and <em>Love Don't Run</em>, are also the only production credits for songwriter Lee Thomas Miller (outside a few non-album singles by both him and Amy Dalley).
</li><li> The site <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/index.php">Bubblegum Dancer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that collects examples of bubblegum dance music from all over the world, has plenty of artists and projects known only for one album or single. They even listed the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/lists/2-Top_20_Bubblegum_dance_One_Hit_Wonders_of_all_time">Top 20 Bubblegum One-Hit Wonders<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The country music group One Flew South is a double example, as their 2008 album <em>Last of the Good Guys</em> was not only their sole album (and "My Kind of Beautiful" its only single), but also the <em>only</em> release of a revival of Decca Records Nashville, which had previously been merged into MCA Nashville in 1998.
</li><li> Robert Wright produced, engineered, and played bass on the first three albums by country music singer Chris Cagle (except for some bonus tracks on a re-issue of his debut, which were produced by Chris Lindsey instead), and does not appear to have done anything else.
</li><li> Obscure singer-songwriter Wyatt Easterling has had a few scattered credits writing and playing guitar on others' albums, but his only production credit was four tracks on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMichaelMontgomery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMichaelMontgomery">John Michael Montgomery</a>'s 1992 debut <em>Life's a Dance</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Device" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Device">Device</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal">Industrial Metal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">Supergroup</a> consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a> frontman David Draiman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Filter">Filter</a> guitarist Geno Lenardo, was formed during the five year hiatus of the former. They released one album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Device</a></em>, with their single "Vilify" being their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only success</a> on rock radio. Afterwards, the project was shut down and Draiman returned to Disturbed. He has gone on record stating that he has no intention of ever making another Device album.
<ul><li> A different band named Device is also a one-album wonder. Formed in the mid-'80s by Holly Knight (who's best known for writing songs including "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatBenatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatBenatar">Love Is A Battlefield</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Better Be Good To Me</a>"), this Device released a single album, <em>22B3</em>, before disbanding.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Europop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Europop">Europop</a>/dance/trance group DYCE released a self-titled full-length album in 2006, then seemingly vanished from the face of the earth. The last known song heard from them was a 2008 collaboration with fellow Swedes Bad Influence titled "Tarzan Boy".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(Japanese_band)">S.K.I.N.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Japanese supergroup made by big names in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> (Yoshiki, Gackt, Miyavi and Sugizo) who was supposed to set not only the Asian, but also the Western charts on fire. Their 2007 performance at the Long Beach Anime Expo was dubbed "The Japanese Concert of the Century"... too bad that was their first, last and only time together. Every few years some of them speak about the possibility of new material from S.K.I.N., but nothing ever materialized after that concert.
</li><li> Italian dance project The Tamperer, consisting of producers Mario Fargetta and Alex Farolfi and American singer Maya Days, are mostly known for their successful 1998 single "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkisiwa-97c">Feel It<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". They only released the album "Fabulous" one year later, a couple of singles afterwards, and all members abandoned the project soon after (Maya Days stopped singing altogether).
</li><li> Another very short-lived Italian dance project was The Lawyer, whose members only released the bizarre "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.discogs.com/it/Lawyer-I-Wanna-MMM/master/118476">I Wanna Mmm...<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" in 1999 before parting ways.

They broke up only a few years after the single's release after failing to secure a record deal, despite their popularity in the local music scene. Shortly before their breakup, the band's keyboardist, John Linnell, left the band to co-found the much more successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a> with John Flansburgh. Despite falling into relative obscurity, many of their unreleased demos were leaked online decades after their breakup.
</li><li> Girl group Madasun started as a quintet in 1997, but soon after became a trio, which released only one album in 2000 and then disbanded one year later because of poor sales. They're known pretty much only for their hit single "Don't You Worry".
</li><li> <em>Grab That Gun</em> is the first and only album from all-girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> Revival band The Organ.
</li><li> Los Umbrellos was a Danish pop/dance band who only released the album "Flamenco Funk" in 1997 and disbanded two years later. They were also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> for the single "No Tengo Dinero" that gained good airplay in several countries (including a #1 in Austria and #42 on the US Billboard Hot 100). The other singles however failed to chart anywhere.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer Billy Hoffman recorded the 2000 album <em>All I Wanted Was You</em> but was never heard from again. Notably, he was able to complete this album despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeafComposer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeafComposer">being 97% deaf.</a>
</li><li> She Moves, a girl group made up of New York Knicks cheerleaders, released just one album, <em>Breaking All the Rules</em>, in 1997, and were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> with the title single.

</li><li> Aylar is a Norwegian (but Iranian-born) former porn star, glamour model and Big Brother contestant who only released the single "Boys Boys Boys" in 2006, itself a cover of Italian popstar Sabrina Salerno's "Boys (Summertime Love)". She later was featured in two dance songs before quitting music to pursue an acting career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer Meredith Edwards' <em>Reach</em> is not only her only album, but also the only album released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">Lance Bass</a>'s music company, Free Lance Entertainment.
</li><li> In 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT">CMT</a> started up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> record label.

</li><li> Sarah Buxton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a> is her only album release to date (barring an EP that had several of the album's songs on it and a handful of guest appearances). The album itself had several tracks produced by hit Nashville songwriters: Blair Daly, Bob DiPiero, and Craig Wiseman, none of whom hold any other production credits.
</li><li> While Casey Beathard is a very popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> songwriter, his only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a> credit is the single "I Wanna Feel Something" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TraceAdkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TraceAdkins">Trace Adkins</a>' <em>Dangerous Man</em> album.
</li><li> Craig Hand had this happen twice. He put out the solo single "Direct Connect" in 2006 but his label closed soon afterward. Then in 2013, he recorded "Crushin'" as the lead singer of Bush Hawg, which also never put anything else out (a second single titled "More Than Corn" was announced, but it was never released and the label dropped the band).
</li><li> KP &amp; Envyi's 1998 hit single "Swing My Way" was their sole release. In the years since, the artists' only musical appearances have been as guest vocalists on a handful of songs.
</li><li> Miss Willie Brown did only one EP for a 2012 re-establishment of A &amp; M Octone Records, led off by the single "You're All That Matters to Me" — which turned out to be not only the duo's release, but also the label's.
</li><li> British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> Neon Jungle were highly anticipated by several reviewers as the next big girl group, following the success of their debut single "Trouble" in 2013. After "Trouble", the group had their biggest hit "Braveheart" before releasing two more singles (both were Top 40 hits) until releasing their debut album <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em>. The album was moderately successful but their fifth single failed to chart, which led to their record label RCA to drop them and eventually they disbanded in July 2015 l, shortly after planning to record their second album, with their sole success being their debut album though averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> status due to having four Top 40 singles before releasing their debut album.
</li><li> Zygott &amp; The Ghost Chasers, the artists behind the theme tune for the British series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTrapDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTrapDoor">The Trap Door</a></em>, released just that one record.

</li><li> Sibling duo Marie Sisters had only one, self-titled album in 2002 for Universal/Republic. It also produced only one single, "Real Bad Mood". Their only other credit was singing backing vocals on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes">LeAnn Rimes</a>' "Commitment" four years prior.
</li><li> Curtis Wright had only one self-titled studio album in 1992 (a previous effort, <em>Slick Hick</em>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">never released</a> due to the label closing). A year later, he became a one-book author a second time in the duo Orrall &amp; Wright with frequent cowriting partner Robert Ellis Orrall (who is not a one-book author). Despite his lack of releases, Wright is still a somewhat popular songwriter and session vocalist.
</li><li> Japanese singers Asuka Hinoi and Hikaru Koyama, of Hinoi Team fame, started their career in the music business as part of a trio called LOVE &amp; PEACE when they were only 11 and 10.

Even despite a Grammy nomination, the album largely went unnoticed, and bass guitarist Nick Lowe later stated that while he had fun with the band he felt the album was "no good". After a roughly two-year career, Little Village split the same year the album came out.
</li><li> Some tracks on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen">Jake Owen</a>'s 2016 album <em>American Love</em> were produced by his road band guitarist Lukas Bracewell, who has no other credits whatsoever.

</li><li> One could argue MDFMK was a one-off act, but then again, they were basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM">KMFDM</a> by a different name. Active when KMFDM had officially broken up (and until KMFDM officially got back together), MDFMK, whose name is simply the same but backwards, only released a self-titled album. The group was founded by ex-KMFDM members Sascha Konietzko and Tim Sköld, with Lucia Cifarelli joining later; all three would stick around when they changed their name back to KMFDM, officially reviving it but ending MDFMK's tenure at the same time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5rckn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5rckn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5rckn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sköld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">would leave shortly thereafter</a>, but that wasn't unusual for KMFDM either.</span>

</li><li> German Eurodance supergroup <a class="urllink" href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/306309-Flame-6">Flame<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> produced only one song, "Next Time (I Promise)", in 1993.

This most likely stems from the members' other commitments, like Reznor resurrecting Nine Inch Nails (also in 2013), his and Atticus Ross' continued work in scoring, and Reznor and Maandig raising their children.

However, "I Wanna Be" was the last anyone ever heard about him. Ironically, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.zorotl.com/">promotional website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is still up.
</li><li> Andy Griggs' debut album <em>You Won't Ever Be Lonely</em> is the only production credit for J. Gary Smith, who co-produced with David Malloy.
</li><li> British Pop Rock band Hepburn, who were high profile enough at one point to get a song featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> disbanded after recording just one album.

</li><li> Norwegian band One 2 Many had a big hit in Europe with "Downtown" but split while their debut album <em>Mirror</em> was still being promoted.
</li><li> Techno artist Brian Natonski, better known as Gearwhore, released only one full-length album, <em>Drive</em>, before vanishing into the ether.
</li><li> Country-comedy artist Guy Drake's only release was the 1970 novelty "Welfare Cadillac".

</li><li> A.O.S. have only ever released one song, "History (Repeats Itself)", which appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers">Natural Born Killers</a></em> and appeared in an edited form on the soundtrack album. For a while, it was a mystery who the artist even was, with the only hint being songwriting credits for Thomas Wilbrandt, Klaus Buhlert, and Fay Lovsky. As it turns out, German composer Buhlert was the main writer of the song, with vocalist Lovsky adding lyrics and a vocal melody to the instrumental, and the song incorporated loops from an album of Erik Satie compostions arranged by Wilbrandt, who otherwise wasn't involved in the project. A full A.O.S album was produced, including a few other tracks with Lovsky's vocals, but it remains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode">Lost Episode</a> since a record deal never materialized.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sarah Strange was a one-hit-wonder as the title character in <em>Ranma One Half</em>. She did do some other voice roles in other cartoons, and moved on to mainstream live-action work, but that was the only anime she was ever in. She left the show after Season 3 and was replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardIanCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardIanCox">Richard Ian Cox</a>, who has had a lot of anime roles.
</li><li> Angela Costain also had a short-lived voiceover career, with Nabiki Tendo being her only anime role (or major role, period). Her sister, Elena Wotten-Costain filled in during Season 6, and also never did any other voicework.
</li></ul></li><li> Currently, Kagome from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a>: The Final Act</em> is Kira Tozer's only anime role.

<ul><li> In addition, Naz Edwards' only voice role is Queen Beryl, but like Liza Balkan, her acting is mostly on the stage. Lots of <em>Sailor Moon</em> voice actors didn't do other anime, simply because the talent pool used mostly does western animation.

<ul><li> Child actor Peter Ostrum was offered a lucrative multi-picture film deal after playing Charlie Bucket but found film acting to be too much hard work, and took the option to go to college instead and work as a farm animal veterinarian in upper New York state, which he is to this day. He only returns to the public eye to do local school assemblies on his life and career, or on rare occasions for Wonka-related events (such as the commentary for the 25th anniversary DVD). Thus, this was his only film role.
</li><li> Michael Bollner, who played Augustus Gloop, never acted again after this movie. He was cast because he was a native of Munich, where the movie was shot and where he still lives to this day, and had to be taught his lines phonetically. Like Ostrum, he went to school and became a professional (he runs a tax accounting firm) and has only been seen in <em>Willy Wonka</em>-related material since.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">The 2005 adaptation</a> of <em>Charlie</em> (and its video game) is to date, Julia Winter's (Veruca Salt) only acting credit. Much like Peter Ostrum, she elected not to continue acting and is now training to be a doctor.
</li><li> Kelly Reno, the star of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackStallion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackStallion">The Black Stallion</a></em>, was set to make a good transition into adult acting when he was badly disfigured in a car accident. By the time he was out of recovery, all his offers had dried up and he never got any others.
</li><li> <em>Paperhouse</em> was the only major film role of lead actress Charlotte Burke.
</li><li> Cassie Barasch, who played evil Thelma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart">Little Sweetheart</a></em>, never acted again (which is strange for a lead actor). Her only other credit was as a post-production intern for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBuscemi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBuscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>'s film <em>Trees Lounge</em>. Ellie Raab, the other child actress in the film alongside her, fared only a little better before disappearing.
</li><li> Charmian Carr's first (and largest) acting role was as Liesl von Trapp in the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>. She then starred in the one-time television production of <em>Evening Primrose,</em> but left the business to raise her children.
</li><li> 1981's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfTheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfTheLoneRanger">The Legend of the Lone Ranger</a></em> proved to be not only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a>, but also destroyed the career of its star, Klinton Spilsbury, who was making his film debut. He hasn't done another film since.
</li><li> John Adames won the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward">Golden Raspberry Award</a> for Worst Supporting Actor for the 1980 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gloria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gloria">Gloria</a></em>. It was his only acting credit, and by 2004 he became the owner of a pool hall.
</li><li> Although he'd appeared in various commercials (and was the voice of Rolly in the Russian dub of <em>101 Dalmatians: the series</em>), Russian actor Vladimir Garin died in a diving accident after shooting had completed for his first feature film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturn2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturn2003">The Return (2003)</a></em>
</li><li> Maria Falconetti was a theatrical actress who had appeared in supporting roles in two short films, but had no feature-length film credits when cast as the lead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfJoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfJoanOfArc">The Passion of Joan of Arc</a></em>. The experience was so traumatic that she quit film work forever, though her performance is widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time.
</li><li> Serbian film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWounds">The Wounds</a></em> was Duan Pekić's first and only film credit. Like the character he plays in the film, he was shot at a young age, most likely due to gang violence, making the film even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a>.
</li><li> Milos Milos's only significant film role was as the title character in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Incubus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Incubus">Incubus</a></em>, the Esperanto language horror film starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>. Shortly after filming the role, he murdered Barbara Ann Thomason - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney">Mickey Rooney</a>'s fourth wife - and committed suicide. His only other credit is a bit part in <em>The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.</em>
</li><li> Mark Pillow, who played Nuclear Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a></em> doesn't have any other film credits and only appeared in a few TV series before apparently quitting acting.
</li><li> Eric Freeman, the actor who played Ricky, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">legendary</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2">Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2</a></em>, has a few other minor and non-noteworthy credits to his name from around the same time, but this is the one movie where he had a starring role. He disappeared completely after 1992, and no one saw or heard anything about him for over two decades. The most notable thing about his performance was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese">over the top</a> it was, which makes it unfortunate that he's played by a different actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Bill Moseley</a>, in the third film, who doesn't even come close to copying Freeman's style (primarily since he only has a couple of lines). The filmmakers were unable to even track him down for the 2003 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>. Thanks to the hilarity of Freeman's performance, it's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheCinemaSnob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheCinemaSnob">the Cinema Snob's</a> lifelong ambition to one day find Freeman and pull him out of retirement. He finally made an appearance at a December 2013 screening of <em>Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2</em>.
</li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix">1776</a></em>, with few exceptions, were all made up from either the original Broadway cast or other productions. While most of them had or would go on to do work in film or TV, this is the only time Ralston Hill (Charles Thomson) and Charles Rule (Joseph Hewes) are seen on screen.
</li><li> Fhi Fan is a Taiwanese male model whose only acting credit is Shuichi in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> exponents David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli are best known in the cinema world as the guys who starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Banlieue13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Banlieue13">Banlieue 13</a></em> and its sequel. While they had have many other works as choreographers and minor actors, they have never played a starring role again (except Belle, who precisely starred in the <em>Banlieue 13</em>'s American remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrickMansions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrickMansions">Brick Mansions</a></em>).
</li><li> Toby Radloff's only movie role was in the 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma">Troma</a> horror movie <em>Killer Nerd</em>, but he's appeared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Himself</a> in several forms of media both before and afterward.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PureCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PureCountry">Pure Country</a></em> (1992) was the only acting credit ever for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gordy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gordy">Gordy</a></em> (1995) was the only starring role for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer Doug Stone.
</li><li> Hatty Jones' first and only feature film role to date was the titular character in the 1998 adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Madeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Madeline">Madeline</a></em>, though she later dabbled into directing and acting in short independent productions.
</li><li> Giorgio Cantarini had the part of the protagonist's young son in two major productions and then only did a few bit parts in small-budgeted Italian movies and TV series. But, since these two productions were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful">Life Is Beautiful</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator">Gladiator</a></em>, almost everyone knows who he was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax2TheRoadWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax2TheRoadWarrior">Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</a></em> was the only major acting credit for both Kjell Nilsson (Lord Humungus) and Emil Minty (the Feral Kid), who only landed a couple of bit parts afterwards. The latter one became a jeweller. Similarly, Max's dog "Dog" never appeared again on the big screen.
</li><li> Stephen Dorff's first film acting credit was in the Canadian horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGate">The Gate</a></em>, and he went on to became a famous actor. On the other hand, his on-screen partners Christa Denton (who played his older sister) and Louis Tripp (his nerdy metalhead best friend Terry) have this as their first and last major film credit. Denton retired from acting; Tripp reprised Terry's role in the film's sequel, and that's pretty much it.
</li><li> The only acting credit to date for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> impersonator Blake Rayne is playing Drexel Hemsley in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdentical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIdentical">The Identical</a></em>.
</li><li> Maureen Elisabeth Shay's only acting credit is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2">Home Alone 2</a></em>, where she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">replaced</a> Angela Goethals as Linnie McCallister.
</li><li> An extreme example is sign-language expert Barbie Reade; her sole acting credit is a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">but memorable</a> scene as, yes, a sign-language translator in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirplaneIITheSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirplaneIITheSequel">Airplane II: The Sequel</a></em>.
</li><li> Italian linguistics professor Carlo Battisti appeared in exactly one movie, when he was 70 years old. It happened to be all-time classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UmbertoD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UmbertoD">Umberto D</a></em>, directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VittorioDeSica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VittorioDeSica">Vittorio De Sica</a>, in which Battisti plays the lead role.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> contestant Colleen Haskell's only feature acting role to date was Rianna in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobSchneider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobSchneider">Rob Schneider</a> comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAnimal">The Animal</a></em>.

However, she's a bassist in real life too, and still plays with her band to this day.
</li><li> John Reynolds had his sole acting credit as Torgo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate">Manos: The Hands of Fate</a></em> and then committed suicide shortly before the film was released.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Selena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Selena">Selena</a></em> was Rebecca Lee Mesa's first and only acting role as the 9-year-old version of the title character.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveField">Love Field</a></em> was the only acting role for Stephanie McFadden.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://jmmnewaov2.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/the-actress-who-never-was-or-the-mysterious-case-of-aya-takanashi/">This blog post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> details how Japanese actress Aya Takanashi only appeared as Tom Selleck's love interest in <em>Mr. Baseball</em>. Her only other acting role was in a two-part direct-to-video Japanese film; then, according to the blog's comments, she retired and became the co-owner of a bar.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> only ventured to the big-screen once. The resulting product, the abysmal <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbeeps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbeeps">Heartbeeps</a></em>, completely tanked. Combined with the miserable time he had filming it, he never tried films again before his death.
</li><li> Subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em>, which was one of only Danny Lloyd's ventures in acting, his only other movie was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy</em>, he later became a teacher.
</li><li> Most of the actors in the Japanese psychedelic cult classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hausu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hausu">Hausu</a></em> only appeared in commercials before (the director also started his career in advertisements) or had no other credits whatsoever, and either had only a few bit parts or never acted again after it. Being amateurs added to the surreal quality of the film.
</li><li> Outside of a few guest appearances on television shows and independent films, Tami Erin's only starring role was the titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking">The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking</a></em>.
</li><li> Carrie Lorraine's only major film role is little Judy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dolls">Dolls</a></em>, not counting a bit part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoltergeistIITheOtherSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoltergeistIITheOtherSide">Poltergeist II: The Other Side</a></em> before. She's now a lawyer.
</li><li> Former child actress Miranda Paige Walls voiced Lilo's rival Mertle Edmonds in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8gqmq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8gqmq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8gqmq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">plus one of its tie-in games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiloAndStitchTroubleInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiloAndStitchTroubleInParadise">Lilo &amp; Stitch: Trouble in Paradise</a></em></span> but decided not to further pursue acting after that, making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> movie her only role. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilianaMumy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilianaMumy">Liliana Mumy</a> would take over the role of Mertle for the rest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch">the franchise</a>.
</li><li> Jimmy Workman has Pugsley Addams from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> as his only major acting role. He was about to quit acting several times, with only a few bit parts in the meantime, before retiring for good. The role of Pugsley seems to "doom" its performers; see also the Live-Action TV entry for <em>The Addams Family</em> below.
<ul><li> Twins Kaitlyn and Kristen Hooper, who played baby Pubert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AddamsFamilyValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AddamsFamilyValues">Addams Family Values</a></em>, never acted in another film again and only appeared in a single episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mouchette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mouchette">Mouchette</a></em> is Nadine Nortier's only film role.
</li><li> This was the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative">sisters Mimi and Meghan Broadhead</a>, who played Ren McCormick's cousins in the 1984 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose">Footloose</a></em>, reportely due to constant attention and bullying from classmates.
</li><li> Pop singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaGrimmie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaGrimmie">Christina Grimmie</a>'s only acting role was in the indie rom-com <em>The Matchbreaker</em>, released a few months after her 2016 assassination.
</li><li> Actress Georgia Weeks' only role was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">Walt Disney Presents</a> movie <em>Ruby Bridges</em>, wherein she played Jimmy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> of a racist mother.
</li><li> Because the role of Mami in Japanese <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrandedToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrandedToKill">Branded to Kill</a></em> required the actress to be naked for nearly her entire time onscreen, none of the actresses at the studio (Nikkatsu) would do it. So burlesque performer Mariko Ogawa was hired for what turned out to be her only film role.
</li><li> Sofia Eng has very few credits on her actress resume; her only major role is Miss Lippenreader in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest">Wild Wild West</a></em>.
</li><li> Joshua Zuehlke only ever played Chuck Murdock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmazingGraceAndChuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmazingGraceAndChuck">Amazing Grace and Chuck</a></em>. He was 13 at the time.
</li><li> Jan Schweiterman's only major acting role was Kurt Bozwell, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">main antagonist</a> of the 1997 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodBurger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodBurger">Good Burger</a></em>.

Afterwards, she became dissatisfied with the rigorous schedule and the pay (she said she made more in a day as a model than she did in a week as an actress), so she went back to modelling. Twelve years after <em>Goldfinger</em>, she appeared uncredited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAvengers">The New Avengers</a></em> episode "The Midas Touch" as Sara, and that was it.

But Ken Weatherwax (Pugsley) is the most fitting example of this trope: before the series he only had a small part in one episode of a Western tv series, then he was typecast as Pugsley well into his teens until he quit acting and became a movie grip and studio builder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAddamsFamily">The New Addams Family</a></em>: Brody Smith (Pugsley) had a small list of credits, but Nicole Fugere is credited pretty much only for Wednesday on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> bio.
</li><li> Most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostLive">Almost Live!</a></em> hasn't acted in anything since, especially Darrell Suto (Billy Quan), who was just one of the show's cameramen.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSingingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSingingVoice">Non-Singing Voice</a> cast had their only acting roles in this show, as most of them were singers based in Nashville. There was one exception, when the person who did Planet Pup would be cast as Jake's singing voice in the American dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tweenies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tweenies">Tweenies</a></em>.
</li><li> Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors">how most people on the show constantly re-appeared in other Canadian works</a>, Albert Rosos, who played Jake in the episode "Following Directions", only appeared in two other TV shows (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KungFuTheLegendContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KungFuTheLegendContinues">Kung Fu: The Legend Continues</a></em> and <em>My Hometown</em>), as well as the documentary film <em>A Day In A Life</em>.
</li><li> Gregory Cross' role as Ed Caruso was one of two recurring TV roles he had (the other being Tugboat in <em>The Line</em>) as well as his only role in a children's work, with his other roles on TV shows being one-shot characters. This is likely because Cross mainly acted on stage.
</li></ul></li><li> Because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> casts mostly young, up-and-coming actors, there is usually one of these in each series for one reason or another.

</li><li> Danny Slavin never acted again after playing Leo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>, with the exception of brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow">Reunion Show</a> appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Super Megaforce</a></em>. He only took the role of Leo in the first place to pay for law school.
</li><li> Caitlin Murphy, who played Ronny in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Power Rangers Operation Overdrive</a></em>, also never acted again after playing her character, and since leaving the show, pursued a job as a schoolteacher and is now married.

When all of the 1980 cast members were fired except for Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo, she returned to appearing as a background extra until 1984. SNL is her only acting credit, and no one seems to know what happened to her.

</li><li> Many of the Japanese VAs of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series (especially, those from the Japanese Disney dubs) have never worked in other works (anime, games and otherwise) besides those games or they only did foreign dubs but not Anime or anything locally created: some of the more egregious examples are Riko Hanamura (Japanese VA for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">Nala</a>) who only does foreign dubs, but not anime or Japanese games.

</li><li> Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> was one of the first studios to experiment with adding voice acting to games. As they didn't have the budget for professional actors (nor were games treated as a serious medium at that point), they roped in many of their programmers and staff as pinch-hit voice talent. Some of them were pretty amateurish, but writer/designer Josh Mandel became known as the definite voice for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King Graham</a>.
</li><li> John Chacon voiced Gabe in the first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> games...and by all accounts, hasn't done anything since.
</li><li> Lora Cain voiced Trudy, Red Lucy, and a few background characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, but did not do any other video games.

</li><li> The English localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> utilized actors whose primary experience is in theatre for the main cast; as such, their performance in the game is often their sole credit.
</li><li> Alex Williamson's only known acting role is the voice of Sarah in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark2008">Alone in the Dark (2008)</a></em>.
</li><li> Tatsuya Tokutake only had one major role in a franchise, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterSideM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterSideM">THE iDOLM@STER: SideM</a></em>'s Kazuki Tsukumo, and some very minor roles afterwards. By the time he retired from voice acting at the end of 2019, Tsukumo remained his only well known role.
</li><li> Joe Assante, who voiced lead character Jake Conway in the rather infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RideToHellRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RideToHellRetribution">Ride to Hell: Retribution</a></em>. He apparently has a background in talk radio, but <em>Ride To Hell</em> is his only known voice acting role.

<ul><li> Thom Huge voiced Jon Arbuckle in all animated adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> from <em>Garfield on the Town</em> (the second animated special) onward through the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, where he also voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">Roy the rooster</a> and various other characters. To this day, those are his <em>only</em> credits in any medium, likely because Huge was Jim Davis' associate at Paws Inc. who got roped into the role.
</li><li> Dee Dee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> is the only voice role for Allison Moore, who was a college friend of series creator, Genndy Tartakovsky. She only voiced the character in the first season, but briefly came back several seasons later when her replacement Kathryn Cressida (who has done some other voice work) was unavailable.
</li><li> Several actors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> have never done other acting, due to actually being people working behind the scenes who got roped into voice-acting, as opposed to professional voice-actors. For instance, Tracy Grandstaff, who voiced the main character on <em>Daria</em> as well as on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead">Beavis And Butthead</a></em>, was a writer for various MTV programs.
</li><li> Michael Wallis' only voice acting role (or acting credit of any kind for that matter) is as the Sheriff of Radiator Springs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars">Cars</a></em>, its sequel and other spinoff media. Wallis is a renowned journalist and historian who was cast for the role because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastTheExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastTheExpert">expertise on the film's primary settings</a>: The American Southwest and Route 66, which he has written several books about.
</li><li> Aside from a handful of brief cameos on a couple television shows, Sarah Vowell's only acting role is as Violet in Pixar's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2">Incredibles 2</a></em>. Like Wallis, she's better known as a writer and essayist (most famous for her appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ThisAmericanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ThisAmericanLife">This American Life</a></em>) instead of a professional actress.

Shortly after the film's release in 1955, he retired from show business altogether and became a fashion designer.
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats">The Aristocats</a></em> is the only voice acting roles for child actors Gary Dublin, Liz "Louise" English, and Dean Clark. After the film's release, late actor Gary Dublin (Toulouse) didn't have that much work in film and television, he did make some live-action appearances such as a reporter in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em>, and an ill-fated teenager in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2">Jaws 2</a></em>. Meanwhile Liz English (Marie) became a regular on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow">The Benny Hill Show</a></em> between 1978-1986 and one of the original members of Hill's Angels.

Her most recent apperance on television was in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZvOO4CNkII">UK commerical for "Key Advice Release"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 2018 as one of the characters.

</li><li> Jim Jordan was a famous vaudeville actor who had done a few short films in the 1940s as his stage character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/FibberMcGeeAndMolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/FibberMcGeeAndMolly">Fibber McGee</a>, but his sole feature film credit was as the voice of Orville the albatross in Disney's 1977 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuers">The Rescuers</a></em>. Like Roberts he retired after the film was released, though in his case due to old age rather than a change in profession.
</li><li> Most of the voice actors on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em> haven't done any acting/voice acting since the show ended, save for a few cameos in other shows or minor voice acting roles (June's voice actress, Julia McIlvaine was in a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mad">MAD</a></em>). Some of the few voice actors still doing work after the show are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleJudovits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleJudovits">Danielle Judovits</a>, who voiced Loopy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale">Ashley Tisdale</a> (Credited as "Ashley Michelle"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition">who voiced Jetcat</a>.

Most notably, Teddy Cohn (voice of Jared) was hired due to being a friend of Stephen Warbrick, and otherwise had never done voice acting before. David Wain, Dana Snyder, and Chris McCulloch, however, are more known outside of the show for their other roles in animation and acting. Christy Karacas and Stephen Warbrick have never acted outside of the series, and Sally Donovan (voice of most female characters) was an otherwise obscure actress who had voiced in MTV interstitials and shorts before being cast. Alice's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty">initial voice actress</a> was even an old college acquaintance of Karacas' who was roped in to do the role, until the Adult Swim executives ordered the role recast.

He was mainly the show's co-writer, story editor, and episode producer. He, however, has a YouTube channel wherein he has uploaded comical videos with himself (including several where he does his Dale Gribble voice).

He retired from acting at the age of 13 and now works as a sales representative for a food distributor in Vancouver, and later got confused with Christopher Evan Welch when <em>he</em> died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has a largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurCast">Amateur Cast</a>, several of which haven't done any other voice work:
<ul><li> Shelby Rabara, the voice of Peridot, has had a few minor on-camera roles, but she works primarily as a dancer, and Peridot remains her only voiceover role to date.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Estelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Estelle">Estelle</a>, apart from a fictionalized version of herself in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em>, has only voiced Garnet. She works primarily as a singer and, while not really a "mainstream star", has a cult following that included members of the show's production crew (specifically its composers), which is partially how she get the role in the first place.
</li><li> Joel Hodgson, the voice of Mayor Bill Dewey, has had no other voice roles. He works primarily as a comedian, an actor in several live-action productions, and is best remembered as the creator and first host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>.
</li><li> Kathy Fisher voiced Fluorite and only Fluorite, and mainly works as a singer-songwriter.

</li><li> There's a variant of this trope where a well-known celebrity plays a voice role in a show or movie, and it remains the only animated work they've ever starred in. Some examples of this are a good amount of guest voices on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11vock');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11vock" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11vock');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> though in some cases, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LukePerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LukePerry">Luke Perry</a>, they will land a second role in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney-related</a> project</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> playing The Fat Guy Strangler on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> playing Dodger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OliverAndCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OliverAndCompany">Oliver &amp; Company</a></em>, Ice Cube providing the voice for The Candlemaker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBookOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBookOfLife">The Book of Life</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion">Céline Dion</a> providing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSingingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSingingVoice">Non-Singing Voice</a> for Juliana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot">Quest for Camelot</a></em>.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em>The Simpsons</em> guest stars, there's a very interesting case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume">Judy Blume</a>'s guest spot in "D'oh Canada": not only is it her only role in an animated work to date, but it's her only role as a character actor, as her other acting credit, a film adaptation of her book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TigerEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TigerEyes">Tiger Eyes</a></em>, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In many works that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenVoicingChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenVoicingChildren">child voice actors</a>, they will only be cast for the work they are a part of. One famous example would be the cast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> specials, who were all kids with little to no acting experience, though occasionally professional child actors were hired, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fergie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fergie">Stacey Ferguson</a> playing Sally in the 80's. In the modern day, there are still cases where child actors only provide voice work on one animated show, but those are few and far between and now only done with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> programming like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies">Bubble Guppies</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>. Nowadays, it's more common to have the same set of child voice actors being used for different shows, like how many of the child characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> share voice actors with those on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood"> Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LibertysKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LibertysKids">Liberty's Kids</a></em>; Reo Jones played British subject-turned patriot Sarah Phillips for the entire duration of the series, but has virtually no other voice acting credits to her name.
</li><li> Adriana Caselotti's only major role was playing Snow White in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>. She had a few cameos like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> as Juliet in the song "If I Only Had A Heart" and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> as a singer in Martini's Bar, but then she retired and only appeared in a few talk shows before her death.
</li><li> Not only was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> the only show created by Pete Williams, it was also the only show he acted in, having voiced the four main characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em>:
<ul><li> This show provides Deann Degruijter's only acting role as a major character (Mayor Goodway), as her only other roles were all minor characters, not counting a recurring role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Franklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Franklin">Franklin and Friends</a></em>.
</li><li> This show is the only animated work Hiromi Okuyama, the voice of Farmer Yumi, has worked on, as she more frequently appears in short films.
</li><li> Owen Mason's only major role on a TV show was Ryder in Season 1.
</li><li> It's also the only TV role of Luxton Handspiker, the voice of Rex. Like Hiromi Okuyama, he mostly does short films.
</li><li> Haruka Sugita, the voice of Everest in the Japanese dub, has done no other TV roles, instead starring in video games and TV ads.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the voice cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>, especially Nancy Hendry (the voice of Amberely), barely did anything else afterwards.

<p></p><h2>Hosts and announcers</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> has many examples:
<ul><li> Host-hostess tandem Pat Sajak and Vanna White, who took over from Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford in 1981 and 1982, respectively, originally met this trope: Pat was a former DJ and weatherman (although he hosted at least one unsold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilot</a> before <em>Wheel</em>), and Vanna's only other TV "role" was as a contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> in 1980. However, their fame in these capacities led to other roles that now make them aversions.
</li><li> Former San Diego Chargers place kicker Rolf Benirschke hosted the daytime version from January 10 to June 30, 1989. This was his only TV role.
</li><li> The only TV role for Cynthia Washington (ex-wife of San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Gene Washington) was filling in for an injured Stafford for just over a week.
</li><li> Tricia Gist (now-wife of <em>Wheel</em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a>'s son Tony) filled in for Vanna for a few weeks in 1991, thus giving Gist <em>her</em> only TV role to date.
</li></ul></li><li> Again contingent on whether or not "contestant" counts as a role, the only on-camera role for Mike Reilly was hosting the short-lived 1990 game show adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em>. Series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a> chose Reilly after he was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> contestant.
</li><li> Yet another game show example: Paola Diva, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration">Concentration</a></em>. And another still in Marjorie Goodson-Cutt on the 1980s-1990s revival, <em>Classic Concentration</em>. The latter was producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson">Mark Goodson</a>'s daughter.
</li><li> Many people have been prolific in other fields, but only hosted a game show once (well, games that made it to air, anyway). Among them are:
<ul><li> Kevin O'Connell (a weatherman whose only hosting gig was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Go">Go</a></em>, as well as the <em>Keynotes</em> and <em>Money in the Blank</em> pilots)
</li><li> Henry Polic II (aka Jerry Silver on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Webster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Webster">Webster</a></em>; only hosting gig was <em>Double Talk</em>, plus the <em>Eye Q</em> pilot). Polic also had his only gig as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">announcer</a> when he filled in for Johnny Gilbert on a few episodes of <em>The $100,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em> during John Davidson's tenure as host.
</li><li> Chuck Henry (an LA news anchor whose only hosting gig was the 1989 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowYouSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowYouSeeIt">Now You See It</a></em>, although he previously hosted an unsold pilot for <em>Beat the Odds</em> in 1975)
</li><li> Laurie Faso (a voice actor and occasional live-action actor as well; only hosting gig was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImTelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImTelling">I'm Telling!</a></em>)
</li><li> Nick Clooney (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney">George Clooney</a>'s father) (a long career as a broadcaster; only hosting gig was <em>The Money Maze</em>)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinLoseOrDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinLoseOrDraw">Win, Lose or Draw</a></em>:
<ul><li> The versions between 1987 and 1992 had a combined four hosts: Bert Convy (1987-89, syndication), Robb Weller (1989-90, syndication), Vicki Lawrence (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>), and Marc Price (<em>Teen Win, Lose or Draw</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>, 1989-92). Among these four people, Convy is the only one of the four to have helmed any other game shows (most notably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tattletales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tattletales">Tattletales</a></em> and <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em>). Lawrence was best known for her roles on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCarolBurnettShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCarolBurnettShow">The Carol Burnett Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MamasFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MamasFamily">Mama's Family</a></em> and was a panelist on several other game shows, but <em>Win, Lose or Draw</em> remains her only <em>hosting</em> gig to date (she also hosted two pilots for Mark Goodson and ABC called <em>Body Talk</em> in 1990). Weller's only other major role was a short gig as host on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EntertainmentTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EntertainmentTonight">Entertainment Tonight</a></em> (he hosted the 1986 pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackout">Blackout</a></em>, the failed 1990 pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SplitSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SplitSecond">Split Second</a></em> and the 1993 pilot of <em>Hollywood Teasers</em>, a revision of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllStarBlitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllStarBlitz">All-Star Blitz</a></em>), and Price's only other notable role was Irwin "Skippy" Handelman on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> version, <em>Teen Win, Lose or Draw</em>, had a few different Mouseketeers from <em>The Mickey Mouse Club</em> announce, none of whom did any other announcing work (or in the case of Brandy Brown, much of anything at all). The exception was Mark L. Walberg, who was <em>not</em> a Mouseketeer, and who had experience in both announcing and hosting game shows for many years afterward (and, since 2006, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AntiquesRoadshow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AntiquesRoadshow">Antiques Roadshow</a></em>).
</li></ul></li><li> "Gorgeous George" Davidson, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN">GSN</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinTuition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinTuition">WinTuition</a></em>, has no other credits.
</li><li> The only television role for Tony Pigg is as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">The Announcer</a> of <em>Live with Kelly and Ryan</em>, a role he has held since the show began in 1983 as <em>The Morning Show</em>.
</li><li> Deejay Mark Driscoll announced the first few weeks of the 1989 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowYouSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowYouSeeIt">Now You See It</a></em> before being replaced with Don Morrow. To date, Driscoll has not done any other television work.
</li><li> The game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrossWits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrossWits">The Cross Wits</a></em> has two examples. The 1975-80 version was the only television role for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Lovely Assistant</a> Jerri Fiala; one week of episodes had her serve as a celebrity partner, while Kitty Hilton (then-wife of game show announcer Bob Hilton) got <em>her</em> only TV role taking Jerri's usual spot. The 1986 revival was also the only television role for announcer Michelle Roth.
</li><li> UK financial journalist Louise Noel's only TV hosting role was the stocks-and-shares game <em>Show Me the Money</em>.

He published a 3-page paper called <em>Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?</em> which completely changed epistemology (the study of knowledge) by showing that apparently, no it wasn't, contrary to everything since Plato. He never touched epistemology again, and in fact has published nothing else.

Niles and Frasier discover a manuscript for his planned second novel. When the author catches them reading it, he asks for their opinion. However, while praising it, they unintentionally make him realise he ripped off Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> and throws the manuscript into the fire.
