Then she does it again with Nehellenia, and finally Galaxia in <em>Stars</em>. The anime also had her talking down lesser villains on a pretty regular basis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo">Tenchi in Tokyo</a></em> ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenchi telling the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Yugi</a> that he accepts and understands her, and she agrees to put herself into suspended animation until she grows up into a better person</span>. His grandfather had earlier remarked that Tenchi had the gift of being able to solve problems without fighting.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>: Since mazoku feed on negative emotions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">Amelia's</a> justice speeches tend to leave Xellos feeling rather queasy.

</li><li> This happens very often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. So much so that the fans consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Talk no jutsu</a> to be Naruto's most powerful technique.
<ul><li> Happens at the resolution of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pain arc.</span> After beating the villain in a fight, rather than killing him, Naruto uses a book written by their shared mentor to get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pain</span> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li><li> Played straight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Naruto's own dark side. It was during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">Journey to the Center of the Mind</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearfulSymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearfulSymmetry">Fearful Symmetry</a> had proven to be pointless.</span>
</li><li> It's also one of the few ways of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing Edo Tensei zombies</span>. If the soul obtains emotional closure, they lose their connection to the physical world and move on, breaking the jutsu.
</li><li> Naruto does it again with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Obito Uchiha. After having torn through his facade as the Ten Tails with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">fused Kurama and Susano'o</a>, Naruto looked into his mind, saw him daydreaming about a world where he was Hokage, and tore apart all his villainous motivations</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened to both of the Big Bads in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>. Gakuto ends up dying in his collapsing castle (voluntary, to "right his wrongs") and Micheal ascends to some kind of Angel-plane, along with the spirits of his fallen minions (who helped Talking The Monster To Death )
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>'s post-series one-shot, Near uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation">a single sentence</a> to end C-Kira's reign.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InfiniteRyvius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InfiniteRyvius">Infinite Ryvius</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>Grey Geshpenst</em> completely outpowers the <em>Ryvius</em> and is only stopped when a badly-battered Neya begs Captain Viscuess to stop, and he realizes he can't go through with murdering 500 children</span>. Combined with the events occurring on the Lift Ship at the same time, this is part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> that words can solve problems that violence can't.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>; after Kotaro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">joins Negi's side</a>, he starts and keeps bothering Negi about the proper way to fight (fighting for the sake of fighting), prompting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Y</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">u</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">e</a> to flatten him with a speech. She even feels kinda bad about it, knowing there's no way a kid like him can stand up to her in conversation if she decides to overwhelm him.
</li><li> Altered slightly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em>. At the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the entire galaxy's spiritua about to be consumed by Lord Geppelnich's monstrously transformed body. Basara's singing finally gets through to another Protodevlin, Sevil, and she begins singing. As a result, she starts to produce spiritua within herself, proof that Protodevlin don't need to steal spiritua from others. Geppelnich hadn't believed the process of consuming the galaxy's spiritua to be reversible, but when he starts singing, it and his transformation reverse. Having no longer need to steal spiritua, they then leave the galaxy</span>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy</span> makes a desperate last attempt to turn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ed, Roy, Riza and Scar</span> against each other, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ed tells him he's realized the reason he hates human beings so much is his very envy of their humanity</span>. His response is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">kill himself</a>. Not a straight example since he was half-dead already anyway and was completely powerless to defend himself, and it was very clear that he wasn't leaving that room alive anyway. He just took what he saw as a less humiliating exit.
</li><li> This is what literally happens to BelialVamdemon (MaloMyotismon in the dub) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>. He linked his soul to multiple children, becoming stronger when said children feel despair. However, the protagonists lifted the spirits of these children by delivering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>. After that, each of the children then mentioned their hopes and dreams which actually destroys BelialVamdemon.

<ul><li> Gohan tries to talk Cell out of fighting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">knowing if he unleashed his hidden power it would end badly for Cell</a>.

</li><li> Mr. Satan (Hercule in the dub) does this to Majin Buu, and it works quite well, successfully appealing to Buus good side and pacifying him. Unfortunately two serial killers cause Buu to transform into a more powerful and evil form.
</li><li> In the original series Master Roshi did a form of this to Tien, trying to get him to turn away from his evil master. He was half successful. It takes Tien fighting Goku and having his master cheat for him before he broke ties with him.

Unfortunately, unlike in most manga, Hao's thousand-year head start on the forces training specifically to fight him proves to be an utterly insurmountable barrier: Hao has been training so long and so hard that he is completely unbeatable, even with all the strongest shaman beneath him working together, and even somehow managing to kill him wouldn't stop him from coming back in 500 years even stronger. Yoh's solution to this is to realize defeating Hao with force isn't an option and never was and proposes an alternative plan: confronting Hao in the Shaman King's realm and convincing him he's wrong. Appealing to Hao's humanity (particularly when Opacho and Hao's mother, two of the few things he truly cares about, join in the appeal) eventually convinces Hao to relent and bring everyone back to life, letting Yoh and the others live their lives without his interference. It's implied this is the only tactic that wasn't simply delaying the inevitable as far as Hao was concerned.The minor exception might be Lady Sati who would have had enough power to defeat Hao just by working with the rest of her team, Team Nyorai, not to mention her Gandhara followers, all of whom were more or less evenly matched with the likes of Jeanne, she just didn't have any intention whatsoever to win the Shaman Fight, and instead wanted to teach Hao how to become a proper Shaman King.</span>

<ul><li> During a team up with Superman, Shazam was forced to possess Superman's body in order to speak with an ancient frog goddess who was threatening to wipe out a large portion of humanity. Cap is able to simply talk her down using eloquence and sincere, heart felt compassion. The goddess leaves without further incident, and Superman admits that Cap succeeded with words where he would have failed with violence.

Cap then spoke to the man, pointed out the destruction he was committing not only was destroying some of the artifacts of Egypt (they were fighting in a museum at the time), but he was also going to harm the people he was hoping to show the wonders of Egypt to. The man actually expelled the wizard from his body out of a combination of guilt and shame because of Cap's words.

Wright</a> has this as a property of the setting—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant">inherently ethical</a>, and if you can convince them their very existence is making the universe worse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">they'll shut down</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, the robots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> can be coerced into shutting down, the method of which depends on how advanced they are.
<ul><li> The early robots in 'I, Robot' could be shut down simply by giving them a decision whose end results, including those caused by inaction, would result in some sort of harm to humans (mental included), a violation of the first law of robotics. Later robots were programmed to choose the lesser harm and could avoid destruction this way, though a sufficiently advanced roboticist could still cause their destruction through a very deliberate and specific conversation. Lastly, (most) robots of all time periods could theoretically be ordered directly to destroy themselves, as the 2nd law, which dictates that robots must obey the commands of humans, supersedes the 3rd, which dictates that robots must enforce self-preservation. However, the robot would need to understand the reasons for its destruction as the difference between the two laws is not terribly considerable.
</li><li> The best example is "Liar!". US Robots accidentally makes a robot that can read minds, and no one knows how they did it. The three main characters (Susan Calvin, Pete Bogert and Alfred Lanning) are amazed by this. Susan Calvin gets told that a man she likes also likes her back, and Pete Bogert gets told that Alfred Lanning has resigned and left his position for Pete. However, soon they discover it was a lie (the man Susan liked is going to marry another woman he had brought to work a few days before, and Lanning hasn't resigned), and Susan makes the connection: the robot is still bound by the Three Laws, and thus it lied to them so that it didn't hurt them. Susan confronts the robot and provokes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> to it, making it realise that both doing something and not doing something will hurt some people.
</li></ul></li><li> A form of this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em> book <em>Isard's Revenge</em>.

This leads to a very short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> before she plays dead — which is exactly what the original did.

The dragon happens to be afraid of nothing. Absolutely terrified, in fact.

</li><li> The climactic "battle" in <em>Grounded: The Adventures of Rapunzel</em> is sorted out like this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Witch's power comes from Rapunzel's carefully cultivated innocence, so Rapunzel gets her to make a deal that, in exchange for letting her memories of her adventures be erased and staying in her tower forever, Witch will answer all her questions until morning.

</li><li> This is to an extent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> of the somewhat unimaginatively named Linguid species in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a></em>. Sure, the <em>average</em> Linguid is just a somewhat furry-looking humanoid next door type who shouldn't be exposed too directly to hyperspace because they'll literally lose their mind; but by virtue of the same "defect" (courtesy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> their distant ancestors spent time trapped in and inheritable ever since), certain members of the species — their arbitrators and especially their few elite "Peace Speakers" — can be very, very convincing if they want to be. (Thankfully, they're also generally pretty careful about not abusing this; the one time the then-current generation of Peace Speakers did start to go off the deep end, it was a sign that there was something seriously <em>wrong</em> with them.) This isn't even mind control; instead, it's a knack for being preternaturally good at figuring out exactly what the other side will actually <em>listen</em> to and then working with that.

This is largely because its world is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">shaped by belief</a>.

As much as the opponent would like to object to that, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">cannot find any flaws in the argumentation, and thus vanishes from existence</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> (from the makers of the Planescape game above), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the Master, could be beaten like this.

All of this unlocks a dialogue choice in the final confrontation with the Master, where the Dweller can confront him with the fact his plan is doomed to failure because of the Super Mutants' inability to reproduce and present the evidence to him.

<ul><li> The DLCs however allows you to talk a potential adversary out of a fight. In <em>Far Harbor</em>, you can convince High Confessor Tektus to either walk away (if you're replacing him with a Synth double) or to talk him into blowing up his cult with the nuke in their base.
</li><li> In <em>Nuka World</em>, while not the final boss you can talk down Oswald the Outrageous either by passing a high-level speech check or give him a holotape of his girlfriend, which convinces him to leave Nuka World and take his ghouls with him. He'll even give you his sword and hat.

It only works if you consistently use the same persuasion option. Either all charm or all intimidate.
</li><li> In The Citadel DLC in Mass Effect 3, Liara attempts to invoke this trope. When the mercenaries you're fighting complain that her drone is annoying with the way that it keeps telling them how badly they're going to lose, she orders it to lower their morale by being even more annoying.

<ul><li> In the sequel, you eventually meet an Spectator (a non-evil Beholder) who is magically bound to guard a box containing an item you need.

With a good persuasion skill, you can make him question why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wardens would want the king dead</span>, and, unable to think of an answer, he agrees to back off.
</li><li> The final showdown with Tolwyn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> IV</em> is this.

<ul><li> A variation in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em>. You can bypass two boss fights by discovering their killphrases before confronting them.

Left with no winning play, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> surrenders and is forced to bargain on their terms.

</li><li> A major aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> is the ability to talk your way out of every fight, although it does not actually cause the thus "defeated" monsters to die.

Most prominently, very near the end, they can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convince the Specter to delete himself</span>. There's also the way <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Specter</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Sorrow</span> play with this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they try to convince the Last Castoff to accept death, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">the player can accept</a>. The Sorrow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">even makes a decent argument for it</a>, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">proper ending</a> and not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny">Tyranny</a></em>'s branching paths allow enemies to be turned into allies and vassals, forcing them to swear loyalty to the evil empire of Overlord Kyros. The most triumphant example of this is likely having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tunon, the Archon of Justice,</span> bend the knee to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Fatebinder</a>, up to that point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of Tunon's own agents and on trial for <em>treason</em> mere moments before</span>.

</li><li> Conspicuous by its absence with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of the first game, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Thaos having become so thoroughly convinced of the rightness of his cause and the necessity of the atrocities he's committed along the way that he absolutely cannot be talked down and will try to kill the Watcher one final time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> Eothas in the sequel is also noteworthy for being physically unstoppable, succeeding in his ultimate ambition, and very likely having won over the player to his point of view regarding the necessity of destroying the Great Wheel, bringing an end to the cycle of reincarnation and the power of gods over mortals within the setting. The Watcher can't stop Eothas, but they <em>can</em> at least make Eothas think about how they can best help Eora move on from the end of the Great Wheel.</span>
</li><li> Invoked by this name in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternityIIDeadfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternityIIDeadfire">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a></em>, specifically in the <em>Beast of Winter</em> DLC, where the Watcher is able to persuade <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracolich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracolich">Dracolich</a> Neriscyrlas</span> to succumb to the entropy and oblivion offered by Rymrgand, the god of cold.

This requires you to choose dialog options in your previous encounters that convinces them to doubt the cult as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assuring your mother that you will save them</span>.
</li><li> A less direct example; In the final level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheOuterWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheOuterWorlds">The Outer Worlds</a></em>, just before confronting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> you have a final conversation with your chosen antagonist (which varies depending on whether or not you side with Phineas or The Board) where you get the chance to convince them to give up, thereby letting you completely bypass the final boss fight. It's slightly more literal if you're confronting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phineas, since talking him down culminates in him shooting himself</span>.
</li><li> Played with in the climactic "Tribunal" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em>, where you confront <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a group of unstable mercs engaging in a stand-off with the local militia</span>. You cannot actively talk them out of backing off and it is made very clear that they'll accept nothing other than bloody satisfaction. However, by carefully choosing your words and arguing with their leader, you can potentially throw them off their guard and thus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaving them open for when you decide to take a shot at said leader, thus taking him out of the fight and leaving the others in a disarray that results in minimizing the casualties</span>.

This leads Peter to realize that if his counterpart is like this, it means the man must've never experienced the most humbling moment of Peter's life: Uncle Ben's death. Peter realizes he can't stop Spider-Carnage, but Uncle Ben can. He's the only person in the multiverse Spider-Carnage would listen to. And indeed the shock of seeing Uncle Ben, who still shows compassion and support for Peter is so great to Carnage!Peter that the latter tries to free himself from the symbiote, and when he realizes he can't, commits suicide via portal to nowhere rather than let himself destroy the multiverse.

</li><li> Still played straight in Britain, but with a twist: because the rules of the British Parliament say that an MP must make points germane to the topic, the usual US tactic of rambling on about anything (derisively referred to by British parliamentarians as "reading the phone book") is not available. The record for managing to spin reflections on a single topic is eleven hours.
<ul><li> One tactic, such as that suggested for enshrining a promised referendum on the EU in 2017, seems to be tabling excessive amounts of amendments to a bill in order to ensure it runs out of parliamentary time.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Zhuge Liang, a legendary Chinese strategist who lived in the Three Kingdoms era, had a knack for this. In an event recorded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, he once challenged an enemy general named Wang Lang to a battle of words, and when Zhuge finished verbally lobotomizing the reasons for Wei's political moves, Wang Lang DIED. Same thing happened with Cao Zhen, but with a LETTER. In the exact words, "Cao Zhen became furious, coughed, and spat blood..." if only Zhuge Liang could have had a little chat with all his enemies...
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/22/214576953/911-call-captures-school-employee-talking-down-gunman">Antoinette Tuff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a school receptionist in Georgia who managed to stop a massacre like Sandy Hook from happening by... <em>talking</em> with the gunman, showing him compassion, opening up about her own troubles, and gently persuading him that shooting up a school wouldn't help him overcome his own demons, and to put his weapon down and turn himself in. No one at the school got hurt, not even a police officer. Needless to say, Ms. Tuff was instantly hailed as a hero all over the country.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun">Attila the Hun</a> and his hordes had burnt, raped, and pillaged their way across Italy and were about to sack Rome, Pope Leo I and two other ambassadors met with the barbarian leader. No one knows exactly what they said, but Attila and his army abruptly turned around and left.
</li><li> On 8 May 1984, Denis Lortie, a Canadian soldier suffering from emotional and mental disturbance, entered the Quebec Parliament with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">C-1 submachine gun</a> and opened fire on government workers, killing three and wounding thirteen others on his way to kill members of the Provincial Parliament (who fortunately were not in session at the time). Enter <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren&lt;!--C3--&gt;A9_Jalbert">René Marc Jalbert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">stood his ground with Lortie firing inches from his head</a> before starting to talk. Finding that they both served in the same regiment (Jalbert fought in both WWII and Korea and retired as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorlyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorlyAwesome">Major</a>), Jalbert convinced Lortie come to his office, effectively allowing himself to be taken hostage, and talked for a few more hours before finally convincing Lortie to surrender himself without further violence.
