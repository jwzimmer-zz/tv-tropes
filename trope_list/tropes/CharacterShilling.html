</div></div><p>Sometimes, we hear about a character who doesn't really line up with the way they've been described, whether it be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">their abilities</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">their personality</a>. Sometimes, though, this information all comes from a second character who is simply <em>amazed</em> at this character. They sing their praises, gushing their little hearts out. Okay, that's all well and good, Mister or Miss Fervent Admirer, but why are you praising them so openly?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This is what is known as Character Shilling. Whether it be an attempt to make us like the character, a way of quickly establishing that someone new is a badass a level above anything we've seen before or whatever the case may be, other people will be extremely impressed with this person and let us the viewers know about it. Whether they actually match up to the hype is optional. Sometimes they really are amazing, and sometimes we have ourselves a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>. Or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>.
</p><p>Remember, it's only really shilling when we don't know why such praise and admiration is being given. If they've already shown they can back it up, it probably doesn't count. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">Show, Don't Tell</a> principle is often relevant.
</p><p>This trope does have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">useful functions</a>. Sometimes shilling can be used to build suspense for a character who has yet to appear (or whose abilities have yet to be shown), in order to make a climactic scene where we see the truth behind all those stories all the more powerfully. Generally speaking, this tends to be more effective with villains than with heroes, as having the other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">act completely terrified of them</a> tends to build up the antagonist as a credible threat, especially if the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">is rarely or only briefly seen otherwise.</a> Other times, it can be used to build up a character who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">never appears at all</a>, either to serve as an inspiration or a foil to the main cast. Sometimes the credentials of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> will be established through shilling, especially when their reputation (and the hero's efforts to compete with it) is more important to the story than their actual abilities. Shilling can also be used to show that the character doing it is a (distressingly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">obsessive fan</a>. And what better way to establish that someone is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a>? Alternately, if the character doesn't live up to the hype, shilling can be used to indicate we're dealing with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> or an individual that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyImpressed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyImpressed">Easily Impressed</a>.

Even his speech at Dakar, which is supposed to be so good that it captures the attention of every Federation politician there and convinces a Titan pilot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">switch sides</a>, boils down to pointing out that even Dakar<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0tibk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0tibk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0tibk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the capital of the Federation</span> is undergoing desertification and that humanity needs to stop it.
<ul><li> To be fair to Char, his stint as Quattro had him masquerading as someone with actual social skills (which he sorely lacks due to devoting 13 or so years to nothing but revenge), and the other characters around him tend to ignore this because, well, he's <em>Char</em>. He's also saddled with the Hyaku-Shiki, a failed prototype Gundam with a transformable frame which, historically in UC means it's saddled with structural issues despite the final product being unable to transform at all (if anything, it's ONLY because of his piloting skill that he isn't killed in the many skirmishes he goes into in said machine). Besides that, he's a surprisingly good mentor to Kamille, and he and old rival Amuro actually get along quite well. It's only when said prodigy gets mind-raped does Char snap after realizing just how cruel the world can be and how much people like the leaders of the Federation have royally screwed things up in order to keep their own power.

<ul><li> In <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl</em>, Cynthia does this with Paul who acts like a jerk to everyone and abuses his Pokemon in order to make them stronger, outright abandoning the ones that he finds to be a waste of time, and yet she refers to him as a "great trainer", who just clashes with Ash because of "different methods", rather than because, well, he's a jerk. Averted, however, with Pyramid King Brandon who hands Paul what is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie">probably his first big loss in the series at that point</a> while calling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">him out on his training methods</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26ui9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26ui9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26ui9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not that it changes anything, as Paul <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticCharacter">remains the exact same</a> through his very last appearance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Ash is forced to forgive</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">him</a></em> despite him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">calling Infernape a disappointment</a> the last time he sees it.</span></span>
</li><li> Ash himself becomes a recipient of this in the <em>XY</em> series. Lots of characters (from minor ones to the gym leaders, and two champions) have the utmost respect for him, and he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">Hero Worship</a> from his band of friends<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3tf3i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3tf3i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3tf3i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to the point that for Ash's fifth gym battle, it was Clemont the <em>Gym Leader</em> who takes a leave of absence from the group so he could train and meet Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">expectations</a></span>. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a> to all his region rivals, and even the one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who Ash eventually loses to in the League Finals</span> unquestionably follows Ash's lead throughout the entire Kalos Crisis afterwards, and in the end contemplates that, between the two of them, Ash is the better trainer. This all in spite of still being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> (though now downplayed). Partly in that, the XY series was probably Ash's most successful bout as a trainer, and considering how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> he was in the <em>Best Wishes</em> era many fans consider this one a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.
</li><li> Lillie, from <em>Pokemon Sun and Moon</em> anime. Many characters praise her efforts for "trying hard" and "getting close enough".

It gets more obvious later on when it's shown that other characters like Nanoha know and like him too, which happened <em>entirely</em> off-screen.
<ul><li> He's also billed as a character who uses a unique fighting style and he has a lot of potential. Yet of all the times we see him fight, he was just swinging his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Divider</a>. There's apparently also something special inside him that the Anti-Magic using villains take their time in trying to recruit him.

When the team first set out to find and meet Fubuki, several characters start discussing rumors about what an amazingly strong and talented person he is, some of which are so over the top (such as "Fubuki the bear-killer") that they're likely parodying this trope. Everyone is quite surprised when they actually meet him and he's nothing like what they expected.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> has several characters comment about Hana. While she is certainly ready to take action in the wilderness or explore more easily than most of the other characters, this is justified by her having been raised in a way to survive in the wilderness. But then there are characters who admire her for her strength, her desire to work hard when she isn't feeling well herself, despite this actually being more of a flaw but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">treated as one</a>. This got particularly bad when Ango and Ryo, both of who clashed horribly with her, praise her stubborn behavior, despite this being the reason <em>why</em> the three of them clashed so much.

Unfortunately, he doesn't get a chance to live up to his extreme reputation since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies too soon.</span> The fact that he spends most of his screentime lecturing Athrun about how he should just ignore his doubts and do his job doesn't help.
<ul><li> He's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a> to Athrun given his short role.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The chunin exam arc really tries to make Sasuke out to be way more powerful than how he is actually being presented in the story. Going into the arc, the only major battle he has had was against Haku in which he had to get bailed out by Naruto. He even loses a fight to Naruto outright as early as episode 3 of the anime (although in this case, it can be argued that Naruto had the element of surprise on his side). Despite this, the chunin arc starts out with him being acknowledged as a rival by Gaara, the main antagonist of this arc whose powers are presented as something far more threatening than what Sasuke should ever be able to match at this point of the series. After this, Sasuke promptly gets his ass handed to him by Rock Lee, yet somehow all the other kids at the exam are seeing him as one of the biggest threats, including Rock Lee himself. Apart from his fire ball jutsu (which never does anything to anyone), all he has is the sharingan he has just awakened, which at this point of the series doesn't actually do anything except for allowing him to read his opponents moves (and even that would be completely useless on Gaara, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersDoTheFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersDoTheFighting">he doesn't move at all most of the time</a>). He only manages to beat the sound ninja because of the cursed seal, which is said to have been sealed away by Kakashi by the time he goes up against Gaara, and he only wins his first match in the tournament by using moves copied from Lee, whom Gaara beat pretty handily. All told, in the eyes of the viewers/readers, he should have no chance to ever win in this fight. Despite this, the anticipation of the fight between the "Uchiha genius and that sand kid" is apparently such a big deal that this fight alone was what attracted the audience to watch the exam in the first place, and the match is postponed when Sasuke doesn't show up in time so as to not cause a riot.
</li><li> A sub-case of this was Sasuke's friendship with Naruto, something that they always refer to as if they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> who knew and cared for each other deeply. This <em>really</em> isn't backed up by their actual Team 7 days; Naruto and Sasuke were working together for at most a couple of months, and they spent most of their time together in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a> mode, with Sasuke dismissing Naruto, refusing to work with him, being jealous of him, or running off on his own to do something else. There was a brief period around the end of the Land of Waves arc where their relationship seemed to be growing more respectful, but that transitioned right into the Chunin Exam arc, which rarely saw them work together and laid most of the seeds for Sasuke's betrayal. That's not to say they were outright <em>enemies</em> then, but their relationship seemed more comparable to two students in a group project who don't really like each other than the kind of closer-than-brothers bond that the series treats it as, especially compared to the many characters that Naruto knew for longer and forged much more evident bonds with.
</li><li> Sakura is this through most of Shippuden (the most glaring being the Kazekage Rescue Arc and the Tenchi Bridge Arc) with her "newfound healing abilities and fighting style." The former sure, but not the latter. She either lost or was coddled during all of her fights outside of filler arcs and even came close to death early on, even though she hardly pulled her weight.
</li><li> Ever since the truth of his actions was made known, <em>many</em> characters have been heaping praise on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi</span>. Whether or not he deserves it is heavily debatable (he did <em>horrible</em> things <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the name of defending his home and maintaining peace</span>). It usually isn't too bad, but it gets weird when even the freaking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> First Hokage</span> says that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi</span> is a better shinobi than he is, and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Third Hokage</span> says that he had Kage-level wisdom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">at the age of seven</a>. Even Sasuke and Naruto, whose lives have been made significantly worse by his actions, shill the guy like nobody's business. Ironically, one of the few people who don't shill him is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi himself, thanks to being revived as an Edo Tensei Zombie and seeing the consequences of his actions firsthand.</span>
</li><li> During the Ten-tails-arc, many characters went out of their way to express how awesome Sakura became, and how she finally caught up to Sasuke and Naruto. While she got to make a memorable showcase of her powers, it doesn't last long before she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">easily beaten by a villain</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">thrown back into the background</a>, and it really wasn't any more impressive than what other members of the Konoha 12 had shown—all of whom were completely ignored by those characters.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also after Kaguya kills Obito, Naruto screams at her that he was "the coolest". Keep in mind that Obito was partially responsible for a vast majority of the mess that happened in the manga - especially Naruto's parents' and Neji's deaths - and only put a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> a few minutes ago. Granted, in that time he did save Naruto's life, helped give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">Next Tier Power-Up</a>, and died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificing himself to save Naruto and Kakashi</a>, but calling him "the coolest" might have been stretching the truth a little bit.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A number of powerful wizards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> do live up to their hype. Particularly the ones who are given the title of Wizard Saint, or are the rarely seen allies of the main guild. However, most of the one-off villains are given quick hype to make them seem more threatening, and generally it's only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> who manages to match whatever the other characters claim about their power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer">The Devil Is a Part-Timer!</a></em>: This trope is the reason why Chiho Sasaki is such a divisive character among fans. The story often goes on about how sweet and kind she is, even to the point of blatantly lying about her personality or bending the story around her. For example, she gets jealous of Acies at one point and the story says this is highly unusual for her and only because of how clingy the other girl is being, but anyone who has paid attention up to this point knows that Chiho is extremely jealous of anyone she perceives as a rival, most notably Emi.
</li><li> This was one of the reasons why Ryo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> was so disliked outside of Japan. When he enters Tamers, the other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">instantly know him</a> despite that he had never appeared (in that series) before, and there's a notable part wherein Kazu and Kenta fanboy over him and talk about how legendary and amazing he is.
</li><li> Pretty much any new character with a new and marketable Deck in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> gets talked up as being a master strategist and a wielder of unstoppable cards, even if their actual strategy is bog-standard and their cards are nothing new. V/Quinton in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> is a good example; he's built up as the guy who taught main character Kaito everything he knows, a guy who gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">Minor Injury Overreaction</a> to damage because he's normally untouchable, and the narrative treats him as the strongest of the Arclight brothers. Over the course of all three of his duels, his strategy consisted of summoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">Dyson Sphere</a> and then sitting on it until the opponent found a way to defeat him. It's mildly impressive that he can bring it out so quickly, and it's a reasonably strong card, but it's nowhere near what his brothers were capable of. The Neo-Spacians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> also get chatted up for their unique "Contact Fusion" ability by everyone, but Contact Fusion wasn't a new concept (indeed, several characters had used the VWXYZ line, which is functionally the same thing), and the Neo-Spacian application of it was, if anything, one of the worst executions of it.
<ul><li> This could also apply to Yugi himself. He's ostensibly a master gamer but frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">loses games in the early manga</a> so that Yami Yugi/Atem can come out and take care of them, plays maybe two major duels by himself in the whole series and without the benefit of all the practice Jonouchi has had in tournaments, somehow manages to defeat Yami Yugi/Atem by the end of the series. He's also played up as being courageous in the English dub and while his heroism is more prevalent than his duelling, he's still less active as a character than Jonouchi and takes fewer responsibilities on his shoulders than Atem. He's presented as part of an equal team with Atem, moreso in the anime, but frequently vanishes offscreen for whole duels at a time. This is zigzagged in Darkside of Dimensions when he's duelling solo for the first time and taking responsibility for rescuing others, but still needs Atem's help to defeat a supernatural threat and hasn't taken up his mantle in any other significant way.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a> is that their shilling is half correct; Jiren really <em>is</em> that outrageously strong (in fact, hes one of the most powerful beings in the entire <em>Dragon Ball</em> universe), but hes <em>not</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> they think he is. Hes really an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> who does heroic things, but is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">extremely cold and rude towards others when off the clock</a>, and sees his fellow Pride Troopers as little more than tools to help him achieve his goals. Of course, it also happened in the regular sense, as about 20 episodes of the "Universe Survival Saga" have characters repeatedly mention how awesome and powerful Jiren is when he spends much of those 20 episodes doing quite literally nothing or <em>one</em> thing when he feels like it, so until he does something, the shilling is all we have to go on and we need to take their words for it.
</li><li> The narrator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillingBites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillingBites">Killing Bites</a></em> would like you to know that because the honey badger is the most badass animal in the world, Hitomi is also the most badass Brute in the world. Sure, the honey badger is an incredibly fearsome animal, but the way the narrator shills it, you would think it could take on God himself and then some.

For example, everybody is fine with smacking around Teruteru for his perverted antics, but when Chiaki punches him, she gets triumphant music playing, a slow-motion, and the other characters gasping in shock. When Chiaki brings in videogames for the class to play, everybody goes on about how cute and sweet she is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">but nobody even thanks Kazuichi for setting up the giant TV so they could actually play the console.</a> Everybody Chiaki meets seems to be inexplicably obsessed with her for no reason - a huge part of the reason Hajime <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> willingly becomes Izuru Kamakura</span> is so he can be someone <em>worthy</em> of her, Junko instantly deduces she's what will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> drive the entire class into Despair, so she sticks her in the very first Killing Game while using Mitarai's hypnosis technology on them</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Izuru recognises her and cries when she dies</em></span> even though he doesn't remember <em>anything</em> before then or care to.

<ul><li> Kyle Rayner was shilled almost by necessity; comic fans were never going to receive him very well, partly because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">was replacing Hal Jordan</a> as Green Lantern, and partly because they had seen how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">Superman's death</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Azrael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Azrael">Azrael</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">becoming Batman</a> turned out to be temporary — DC needed to make sure that Kyle stuck around. They did this by having a range of superheroes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> say, without solicitation, what a terrific guy he is. This only led to eye-rolling among even the fans who liked him. In the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> refused to give Kyle the same treatment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em>, where he was a rookie whom not everyone trusted (particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> and Batman, the latter of whom took <em>twelve issues</em> to even speak to Kyle) — and exactly <em>why</em> he was a good Green Lantern was actually brought up (that he knows fear, as opposed to the fearless-to-suicidal-degrees Hal Jordan). This was sufficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> that he was considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a>.
</li><li> Then it came full circle when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> brought Hal back to be Green Lantern in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanternRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLanternRebirth">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></em>, and every other hero couldn't stop talking about how brave, selfless, and supportive Hal was and anyone who distrusted him was painted in a terrible light. Characters would also frequently explicitly mention how he was "the greatest Green Lantern" without ever defining <em>why</em>.
</li><li> During the Johns era, Hal and Kyle themselves were very prone towards shilling one another. According to Johns, he felt that it was important to establish a brotherly relationship between the two in order to move the franchise past the Hal vs. Kyle debates.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>:
<ul><li> Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> did this to Barry Allen in several directions when he came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. Jay Garrick, the original Flash, shilled his replacement Barry by saying that "Barry made him the Flash", despite fighting crime decades before Barry started. The explanation was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">pretty weird and just raised more questions</a> — he meant that seeing Barry as the Flash convinced him to come out of retirement, but this contradicts the events of the story where that happened. Barry's successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a> also shilled him as an inspiration to him when he was a kid (which contradicts scenes where young Wally considered the Flash <em>much much</em> cooler than Barry Allen and couldn't understand why Iris was dating Barry and not the Flash). Johns defended the shilling by saying it was necessary to avoid Barry being seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for Wally (even though he was the Flash before Wally, and even readers who didn't remember that would probably know that).
</li><li> And then Johns had Barry talk up how great a CSI Patty Spivot is (presumably under the logic that if Barry says she's great, she must be <em>really</em> great... which falls a little flat given this occurs at the same time Barry, a trained CSI, makes a basic rookie mistake at a crime scene). What little work we see her doing is nothing spectacular.

He also got famous during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> by fighting the Nazis and apparently dying in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, which bolstered his reputation among other heroes.

In nearly every appearance, characters would shill Bullseye as an unstoppable murderous psychopath — despite the fact that he's not particularly intelligent, nor is he much more dangerous than any guy with a gun. He joins the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkAvengers">Dark Avengers</a>, where he's treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> (despite his teammates including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">walking nuclear reactor</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">cannibalistic</a> alien parasite, and a deranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>).

In any event, the character who shills Doom the most is usually Doom himself.

Barely a scene will pass without a big-name character praising her intelligence, S.H.I.E.L.D. holds a special meeting to talk about how wonderful she is, and Tony Stark himself even gets in on the act, despite heaping praise on others being very out-of-character for him.

This happened despite Carol not really being an A-lister until her rebranding; prior to then, her most prominent contribution to Marvel lore was an on-again-off-again Avengers membership and being the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a>.

This can be a bit of a hard sell, as while the JSA are by no means losers, they also distinctly aren't the foundation upon which the DCU's A-listers built their careers. Only the Flashes could be claimed to derive any inspiration from a Society member; the others all more or less went out of their own initiative, and that's before getting into the fact that the Society were well below the League in notoriety, feats, and influence for most of the Post-Crisis era.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4uzif');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4uzif" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4uzif');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's even sillier from an out-of-universe context; the entire reason the JSA are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSuperhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSuperhero">Old Superheroes</a> and, say, Superman isn't, despite him debuting first, is that their books were cancelled and his wasn't.

</div></li><li> One criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor">Pearl Harbor</a></em> is the way that many characters gush over Rafe's skill as a pilot.

His physical superiority is demonstrated only a couple of times, his superior intelligence is thwarted by his plan and the execution. The Enterprise crew overpower him by hiding in a nebula and shooting torpedoes all over the place.

Schools teach about her, and many other mutants consider her an inspiration — Storm idolizes her, and Quicksilver claims she changed his life (although apparently with a ten-year delay, during which he mooched off his mother like he did before). The main problem with this is that all she really did was be in the right place at the right time — she only saved the President because she was trying to kill one of his advisors, most of the events of the previous film were her fault to some degree, and she's generally not a pleasant or trustworthy person.

Scores of unnamed friends and co-workers gush about how awesome they are, and they <em>themselves</em> think about how special they are and what a privilege it is to be around them. The authors failed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">Show, Don't Tell</a> — they wanted these characters to be awesome, but they only <em>told</em> us how awesome they were without showing it in action. Buck in particular pairs it with a bad case of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> — he's supposed to be a legendarily incorruptible reporter, but over the course of the series we've seen him bury multiple major stories in exchange for protection from — and a <em>job</em> with — the group he would have exposed. This is pretty much a necessity since, in practical terms, they not only never actually achieve anything but it would actually be <em>impossible</em> by the rules of the story for them to do so.

His companion Twoflower, however, thinks he's the mightiest magician who ever lived. This really gets on Rincewind's nerves, especially when Twoflower's going on about what a mighty warrior he is, and all he really wants to do is run far, far away.
</li><li> S.D. Perry's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series go to extraordinary lengths to sell readers on how smart, brave, tough, smart, gifted, smart, and really, <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">smart</a> Rebecca Chambers is, despite her scientific knowledge never rising above that expected from anyone who paid attention in junior-high chemistry. Every sympathetic character, even the protagonists from the actual games, gets at least one inner monologue describing how fiercely independent, resourceful, and intelligent she is, and she becomes the star of <em>two</em> original novels where she basically saves the world singlehandedly while riding atop a massive, cresting wave of adulation from the other characters. It's notable that these books were written before the 2002 <em>REmake</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">changed Rebecca's characterization</a> into that of an intelligent and well-grounded but very stressed-out young woman in way over her head, so Perry's only source of inspiration for her super-genius version was the obliviously cheerful dingbat from the 1996 original.
</li><li> All of the main cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> gets this treatment. We're <em>told</em> how wonderful Edward and the Cullens are, but their actions and behavior throughout the series suggest anything but. Bella herself is constantly described as amazing and special, without really doing anything to deserve it.
</li><li> Eragon of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> gets plenty of this. Several of his accomplishments are frequently praised by the other characters, even though most aren't extraordinary compared to what others have done. This is most evident regarding Eragon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">skill with words</a>, despite the fact he supposedly has terrible grammar and no practice at writing or giving speeches. He's also praised as a great and wonderful hero despite doing several selfish or un-heroic acts, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">choosing to hang out with his friends and ignoring a man who asked Eragon to heal his dying wife</a>.

When we do finally meet him, he's utterly devoid of redeeming qualities.
</li><li> In the final book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, Elayne is chosen to be in charge of the armies of light. She was the perfect choice, a wonderful leader, and did a great job. We know this not because we see any examples of her leadership, but because at least once a chapter someone comes up to her and tells her what a wonderful leader she is and how glad they are that she was chosen to be in charge.
</li><li> Count how many times someone in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> talks about how "there aren't many people like Richard" or "Richard is a very rare person" or "Richard was the most (fill in the blank: compassionate, humble, brilliant, gentle, kind, brave) man (he/she) had ever met." You'll be over a hundred by the time you finish the first book. It's debatable whether Richard actually displays any of those qualities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>, Katniss' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">narration</a> does this to her father and sister, and Peeta to a lesser extent. Her father died years ago and she only remembers him as a saint, forgetting or ignoring his bad qualities. She adores her baby sister, is very protective of her, and can't imagine anyone not loving her. As for Peeta, her opinion of him shows subtle clues that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's falling in love with him</span>, but unlike the other two, other characters shill him as well, with Katniss even outright claiming he saved her in the Games, even though Peeta was largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> and Katniss spent much of the second half of the book trying to heal his injuries. Katniss and Haymitch also tend to treat Peeta like he's some kind of saint, with Haymitch telling Katniss that Peeta is a much better person than she is and Katniss agrees with him to the point of being willing to die protecting him in the Quarter Quell despite the fact she has a mother and younger sister who would be devastated by her death. This is even though Peeta outright states he threw Katniss the bread the day they met because he was in love with her, not because saving a girl from starving to death was the right thing to do; willingly chose to kill a defenseless girl in the Hunger Games purely to get the Careers to trust him; was fine with manipulating Katniss into kissing him on-camera because they were supposed to act like they were in love but had the nerve to get pissy when it was just an act on her part; got mad at her for spending time with Gale; and generally shows himself to be a pretty devious, slimy person, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">especially when it comes to Katniss.</a>

Nyx chose her because she is supposedly wise beyond her years, is a fount of empathy and compassion, and is well versed in both the old ways and the modern world. She has an instant fan club of people that serve mainly to ooh and ahh over how wonderful she is, men fall at her feet in droves because of how beautiful and awesome she supposedly is, and she gets new tattoos and praise for her bravery from Nyx anytime she takes care of whatever problem is plaguing her that particular book. Actually reading the book shows us that she's a stupid, shallow, judgmental hypocrite that doesn't do much of anything except bemoan her boyfriend problems until the authors decide that something needs to happen so the book can end.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em>, Hazel's description of Augustus Waters, from the very first time she meets him, is pretty glowing, focusing on his good looks, charisma, and the connection they have in conversation, compared to her descriptions of other people (which tend to be affectionate, but don't gloss over flaws). This ends up fading away as she gets to know him, even though she falls in love with him (and he with her) she gets to see his flaws in greater detail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, mostly in material written by Vicky Holmes, Ashfur and Hollyleaf tend to be characterized as good and noble cats in tragic circumstances they couldn't help, playing down their crimes and motivations for committing them.
<ul><li> Ashfur is described as a "good mentor" to Lionblaze in the Ultimate Guide, which is debatable since they didn't get along at all - they even fought each other once - and he also possibly taught Lionblaze some moves incorrectly (at least Lionblaze thought so and accused him of it). More than once Ashfur's attempted murders of the father and three kits of the she-cat who rejected him is handwaved as "his only fault was to love too much" (including in a scene where he made it to the cats' equivalent of heaven).
</li><li> Hollyleaf's behavior was whitewashed at least once (in the Ultimate Guide): her murder of Ashfur was described as an accident where she didn't mean to fatally wound him, he fell into the stream himself, her self-imposed exile from the Clan was due to guilt, and her motivations were basically fear and being overwhelmed by the secret. In the book where it actually happened, her brother saw in her memories that she intentionally tried to kill Ashfur, she even stated that she threw his body in the stream to hide it, she ran from the Clan because they wouldn't view the murder as her doing "the right thing", and her motivations were more along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">Black and White Insanity</a>.

<ul><li> Lily Potter gets this by virtually every character who ever knew her, and the only people who don't sing her praises are driven by jealousy (Petunia) or evil (the Malfoys, Voldemort), with everyone talking about how kind, clever, beautiful, talented and overall amazing she was. While James has his virtues and flaws examined in close detail over the course of the series, particularly pertaining to Snape, Lily has no flaws and is shown to be right in every single situation she's involved in during flashbacks or secondhand accounts, such as calling James out for being a showboating bully or Snape's obsession with the Dark Arts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> towards any Muggleborn who isn't her.

</li><li> Cedric Diggory receives some shilling in the Fourth book, though nothing he does seems particularly amazing and the stuff he does do only seems impressive because he is older than Harry and thus has more experience.

It's even lampshaded and justified by Bast who points out he is not an unbiased source when it comes to her and she's actually merely pretty and not breathtaking the way Kvothe describes her, but the narration still goes out of its way to praise Denna on how beautiful, talented and witty she is, despite her personality mostly being a flirt towards rich men because she depends on their handouts and during her adventure with Kvothe she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> as Kvothe has to drop what he's doing to take care of her after she accidentally poisons herself with denner resin - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">which happened because she just stuck a random substance she found in an abandoned house in her mouth</a>, yet she continuously gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Women Are Wiser</a> trope associated with her.

While it's true that Kelsier is the leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, a skilled Mistborn, and great at sewing discord among the nobles and hope among the Skaa, people do tend to turn a blind eye towards his less than stellar traits at times. It's even lampshaded when Elend complains in his internal monologue that even Kelsier's <em>handwriting</em> is legendary. Likewise with Vin, while she is a naturally very strong Mistborn and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was the one who killed the Lord Ruler</span>, she herself admits she managed that by sheer luck and other characters tend to harp on about how talented/beautiful/capable she is a lot, without much basis for comparison since she's the <em>only</em> major Mistborn character after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kelsier's death</span>, to the point that Lord Elend reacts in absolute terror when he discovers a teenaged girl is coming to kill him.

<ul><li> One of the initial reasons comic fans reacted poorly to the show was because of the writers' insistence on constantly comparing Grant Ward, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a>, an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">Avenger</a> from the comics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">movie</a>.

</li><li> Skye took a lot of flak, largely because nearly everyone else on the team was head-over-heels in love with her by the second episode, despite knowing she was an anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. hacker who hadn't yet done much to prove her new loyalties. Coulson already saw her as a substitute daughter, Ward and Fitz both had crushes on her, and Simmons had formed a sisterly friendship with her. Only May ever expressed any real doubts about letting her work with them. Even when she betrayed the team for her ex-boyfriend and fellow hacktivist early on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">everyone got over it within a couple of episodes</a>.

It was most infamous with Season 11 contender Phillip Phillips; despite having little vocal range and repetitive performances, the judges relentlessly praised the heck out of him and he won the season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent">America's Got Talent</a></em> also has a tendency to shill its contestants. 12-year-old Grace Vanderwaal was shilled repeatedly by all four of the judges no matter what, though her voice sounded like she was going through puberty at the time of the season's run and most of her performances were somewhat repetitive. She went on to win the season and is considered to be somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>.

She spends most of Season 1 getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">damselled</a>, most of Season 2 descending into drugs and alcohol, and most of Season 3 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hiding her sister's death from her father</span>.

The shilling migrated over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em>, with everyone <em>there</em> gushing about her no matter how tangentially they know her, and even Thawne gratuitously calling her "a great woman".
</li><li> Tina Boland aka "Dinah Drake" is written to be Laurel Lance's successor as Black Canary, and thus has been shilled upon her introduction. The production team even go out of their way to build her up on social media to make the audiences fall in love with her. However, the coincidences of her skillset and name reeks of the writers trying to present the character as "better" than either Laurel or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Alternate Self</a> from Earth-2 (the fan-favorite to succeed the former) and thus perfect for the role has instead made the character both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> <em>and</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>.

One episode in particular had the couple break up, only for Xander to admonish Buffy by telling her how awesome he was, which only made the problem worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>: The Charmed Ones in later seasons are explicitly shilled by other characters, who often make mention of their selflessness — even though by then, they've forsaken their own destiny so they could focus on their own lives.

<ul><li> Jason Gideon was being shilled as early as the pilot (to the obvious annoyance of Morgan and Hotch). He left the show two seasons later, but his replacement David Rossi was similarly talked up, and Alex Blake later had the same thing happen to her. In all cases, we never saw what made them so good at their jobs.

In comparison, Gawain is actively doing more to rally the Fey and resist the Paladins for much longer (leading night raids, getting food, leading refugees to Nemos etc) but doesn't get nearly as much hype.

<ul><li> This happens quite a bit to Mia during Season 8, much to Holly J's (and many fans') annoyance. The character was seen by many as being unrealistic, but the showrunners kept trying to portray her as amazing.

It's especially perplexing that Jay would talk Emma up like this because a few years ago, she <em>prostituted</em> herself to him. For rubber bracelets.

<ul><li> The Doctor refers to K-9 as his "best friend", but he never really deserves this, especially considering that the Doctor has known Leela longer and seems to like her more. Fans saw this as a cheap way to introduce a mascot to the show. (They were particularly burned because the first time the Doctor <em>ever</em> had a "best friend", it was a really big deal, and it was in reference to Sarah Jane, who definitely <em>did</em> deserve the title).
</li><li> The Daleks needed some shilling in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek">first appearance</a> in the new series, as they had undergone some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> over the years, and while "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a>" had gone a way to fixing this, it had been roughly twenty years before, at a time when the show's audience had already greatly declined.

</div></li><li> Rose Tyler is often seen this way. The Doctor and Captain Jack would gush about how special she was, while many fans thought there was little evidence of this (and a few considered her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue">Canon Sue</a>). It got even worse after she left, as the Doctor would hype her up to his next companion Martha, who was left feeling she could never live up to her (and Rose had to come back anyway to help save the universe, despite being specifically told that doing so would put the whole universe together).
</li><li> Clara Oswald is treated like the Doctor's single most important companion. Most of this has to do with where the story thrust her, rather than any exceptional abilities compared to other companions. The show started to treat it like an incredible accomplishment that she wouldn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHeel">twist her ankle and turn useless</a> (it had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope">been forever since a companion did that anyway</a>). The Doctor grew extremely protective of her and close to her, even though she didn't deserve this more than some other companions, leading to him becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a></span> (which is admittedly something that <em>doesn't</em> happen very often with his companions). Some of this is mitigated by the Doctor's decision to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">painful procedure</a> to wipe his memory of her</span>, which at least shows he's learned not to mope about her as he did with Rose.
</li><li> One complaint about the new series is that the Doctor <em>themself</em> is often subjected to character shilling. YouTube critic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Hbomberguy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Hbomberguy">Hbomberguy</a> observed in one of his videos that the Eleventh Doctor's first appearance involves him scaring off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> by simply telling it how cool he is, and other characters speak of him reverently as if he is a god, whereas in the older series, and even in the earlier revival series, the Doctor was just someone who went on adventures and was only one piece of the puzzle to each episode's plot, rather than the axis around which the entire Universe spins.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> did this to Rachel. The series seemed to go out of its way to make her a desirable character, and her friends spoke of her accordingly. They make a big deal about how she "made it on her own" (<em>i.e.</em> left her life as a spoiled rich kid to live with her friends who bail her out when she screws up), how she's a "career woman" (with maybe the easiest job in the cast when she can hold one down), how great <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a mother</span> she is (she's not — the show jokes about it), and how awesome a girlfriend she is (when she's probably the most difficult to please out of anyone in the cast, and not noticeably more attractive than Monica or Phoebe).

<ul><li> Karl Tanner mostly shills himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">going on at length about what a feared killer he was before joining the Night's Watch</a>. Rast and Gren get in on the act, agreeing with his self-promotion as an unstoppable badass. But what does the audience actually see him do on-screen? Stab an old man (who did get some shill from Half Hand for being a tough one, but still), brutalize a bunch of frightened unarmed women, brutalize some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a>, show off some flashy knife moves, and promptly die in his first fight scene to speak of.
</li><li> Renly Baratheon is described by loads of people as someone who would make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">ideal ruler</a> in contrast to his austere older brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Stannis</a>. Even the writers openly said Renly would undoubtedly make a better King than Stannis. But Renly doesn't actually show any statesmanship, in his Small Council meetings just going along with what his oldest brother King Robert says. The idea that he's being supported by so many Lords falls somewhat flat when you remember he and his father-in-law are their Lord Paramount. And despite the idea that he has a caring and kind nature, he shows he was quite willing to start a war and kill his brother to usurp the Iron Throne, even turning down an offer from Stannis to become their heir and be on the Small Council (something that would be likely to land him on the throne for quite a few years). Part of this is explained by the writer <em>really</em> hating Stannis, forcing some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a> on Renly's part compared to the books, and his grandmother-in-law Olenna Tyrell says he knew how to look good and thought that meant he should be King.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen gets a lot of this from season four and on. Her liberation of Slaver's Bay is talked up by everyone in her faction (unsurprisingly given most of them are slaves she saved), glossing over the later issues she faces trying to rebuild the economy. That said, she is dismantling a thousand-year-old regime and is the first person in centuries to revive <em>dragons</em> so it's unsurprising she's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a>.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister himself gets some shilling in later episodes when people constantly refer to his "brilliant mind", even though after he becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dany's Hand</span>, his so-called "brilliance" ends up costing a lot of defeats thanks to his outdated information and positing himself as an excellent tactician and military strategist when he really isn't. He <em>is</em> smart, but not as smart as the show wants us to believe. Peter Dinklage even lampshaded this in an interview for "The Long Night" by pointing out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you'd think Tyrion of all people would have realised hiding all the non-combatants in the crypts of Winterfell was a <em>terrible</em> idea considering they're fighting an enemy who can raise the dead.</span>
</li><li> Ramsay gets this by others, especially in season 6 where his enemies talk about how smart he is despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> tendencies and hasnt shown any long-term strategic mind.

Considering Dagless is played by the titular Garth Marenghi, who also wrote and directed the series, it's a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Marty Stu</a>. Of course, this show <em>is</em> a parody of the eighties horror genre, so it's natural that this trope is getting parodied as well.

Both men and women rave about how beautiful and <em>perfect</em> she is, and almost every heroine on the show is compared to her and told how they will never measure up to her. She's been more or less officially designated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a> of <em>two</em> different men. But she's far from a perfect person, and her returns usually result in the ruination of a few relationships.

This culminated in "Furt", a whole episode of Kurt-shilling, upstaging even his dad and Finn's mom getting married (Finn's best man speech and even the parents' wedding vows were all about Kurt). Thankfully they let off on it after that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions">but did so by sending Kurt to Dalton</a>.
</li><li> Other characters constantly talk up Blaine as a talented, attractive dreamboat, especially in Season 3.
</li><li> Rachel Berry swims in an unending sea of this with regard to her singing ability. Every character, even those who are rightfully put off by how incredibly self-centered and rude she is, falls over themselves to talk about how her singing voice is flawless, miraculous, the greatest thing they have ever heard, and how she is destined to be a shining star. It even takes bald-faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> from Tina to persuade the dean of Rachel's dream school to give her a second audition... after Rachel completely screwed up her first one.
</li><li> Marley Rose is described as amazing so often, you'd think everyone was being drugged into doing it. She's as thick as two short planks, gets everything with no effort, and has the personality of a wet blanket — and yet nobody (not even the mean characters) has a bad thing to say about her, she has two guys chasing after her, and she seems to be an uber-special member of the Glee club.

This is partly because of the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dan <em>is</em> Gossip Girl, and everyone's suddenly willing to forgive him for basically stalking them, outing their secrets, humiliating them, and generally being a dick for the entirety of the show</span>.

<ul><li> Don was introduced in Season 5 as "the guy Robin would inevitably marry," but his subsequent appearances paint him as annoying and flawed. As soon as he started showing romantic interest in Robin, Marshall does not stop gushing about him. We don't even see their interactions, but Marshall calls him "smart, handsome and funny". This is jarring because two episodes ago we were supposed to hate the guy.
</li><li> Once Robin met Don, Barney was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> into a supreme womanizer who scored with every girl he hit on... and the rest of the cast inexplicably became his enthusiastic cheerleaders, even though in earlier seasons they'd only kind of put up with it and even expressed occasional disgust at some of Barney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">slimier methods.</a> They rooted for Barney every time he hit on a girl, actively helped him out at one point, and celebrated every time he scored (which was often). It was as if the writers were desperately telling their viewers, "See? See how much better Barney is as an exaggerated caricature of himself than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">when he was paired with Robin</a>?" Then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructedtrope">deconstructed</a> when Robin reveals that she was actually quite upset when Barney started chasing girls and the other started cheering him on.

The problem with this was that not only did she spend much of the first year of her son's life using him to pull in her longtime crush Ethan (even naming the boy after him), but she wasn't even <em>with</em> him — she was vacationing in L.A., where Ethan and his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">happened to be seeking help with her complicated pregnancy</a>.

<ul><li> Really, the whole series. Jayden's so great, Jayden's so important, Jayden is the best warrior ever, we love him so much, he's so bright and shiny and perfect... and just as surely as the heroes are the Jayden Cheerleading Squad, he's the only enemy the villains feel is important.

SERIOUSLY, WE GET IT.

While he's actually <em>less</em> annoying than most examples on this list (where all too often, the shilling is repeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attributes</a> of characters who actually display none of the positive qualities everyone gushes over) it creates a bit of a problem where your enjoyment level of this season will largely depend on whether or not you can worship Jayden as much as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">the writers</a> are telling you to.

Across only eleven episodes, the character is described by allies and enemies alike as amazing, perfect, feisty, pretty, a treasure, a good fighter, brave, compassionate, and beautiful. Hilarity stems from the fact that she often displays the <em>exact opposite</em> qualities to the ones affixed to her. For example, the episode in which she's lauded as "compassionate" involves her repeatedly insisting that the outlaws leave her romantic rival to be raped and murdered by a psychopath, and the "good fighter" compliment makes no sense whatsoever considered she's the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Load</a> who spends most of her time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">getting kidnapped</a>.

</li><li> Molly Clock also gets this a lot, with people (again, Elliot in particular) shilling how nice, smart, and overall great she is, even managing to pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a> on both Dr. Kelso <em>and</em> Dr. Cox when they find her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">constantly upbeat demeanour</a> (justifiably) annoying. The only character who actively avoids/dislikes her is Turk, and that's because he thinks of her as a "devil woman" who can read his thoughts because she's <em>that good</em> as a psychiatrist and he claims any man would kill to have sex with her, Elliot acts like a schoolgirl with a crush towards her after some initial hostility, Carla gets jealous because everyone starts taking their problems to Molly over her despite barely knowing her, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> of J.D's for a short time and even manages to heal <em>the Todd</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">though it doesn't stick</a>). J.D and Turk even claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">she's the second hottest woman in the hospital.</a> This is even though she pulls some really manipulative stunts over her stay on the show, frequently makes stupid mistakes like trusting a drug addict (which is something Dr. Cox busted Elliot's balls over previously) and dating terrible men and she herself even admits that Elliot puts her on a pedestal way too much.
</li><li> Jordan tends to get treated like some kind of indomitable badass who is the only person who can control Dr. Cox, but since she inherited her position from her father and only comes into the hospital seemingly when she feels like it, she comes off more like a lazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> than anything else and though she complains about Dr. Cox's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> tendencies, she's just as bad (if not worse, since <em>why</em> she's like that is never explored) as he is but never gets called out on it. She's very rarely, if ever, put in a position where she has to stand on her own with the odds against her the way Carla and Elliot are.

All of the praise heaped upon the character couldn't hide the fact that she really wasn't all that amazing and would often indulge in petty behavior.

</li><li> In-universe, the Zakdorn rely on their reputation as master strategists, which has ensured that nobody ever dared to fight them. Characters who meet one on TNG are less than impressed with his abilities. Apparently no race had <em>ever</em> attempted to tangle with them just because of their reputation, which annoyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Worf</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Worf:</strong> This Zakdorn does not appear to be a very formidable warrior. <br/><strong>Data:</strong> In the game of military brinkmanship, individual physical prowess is less important than the perception of a species as a whole. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">For over nine millennia, potential foes have regarded the Zakdorn as having the greatest innately strategic minds in the galaxy.</a> <br/><strong>Worf:</strong> So no one is willing to test that perception in combat? <br/><strong>Data:</strong> Exactly. <br/><strong>Worf:</strong> Then the reputation means nothing.
</div></li><li> "Peak Performance" actually manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invertedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invertedtrope">invert</a> this for guest star Kolrami; the episode consists of the entire cast attempting to hammer into the viewer how "smug" he is supposed to be, but in reality, every crewmember of the Enterprise spent the entire episode being <em>far</em> more obnoxious and smug than he ever acts.
</li><li> A slightly more modest example was Dr. Pulaski. Characters often stated to each other (and the audience) how comforting her bedside manner was, and how she was a kind, loving physician. In reality, the character was abrasive, and her attempts at gentle teasing came off as bullying and mean. Definitely the last person you'd want by your bedside if you were sick.

Never mind that it's a violation of the established rules of the setting that he even knows who she is — because he's not originally from Palamecia, so he shouldn't know Palamecian legend (and in fact, his ignorance of it is plot-important in <em>many</em> other scenes). The implication is that she's so special, <em>every</em> other world in the Void has her as a goddess figure. This is also noticeably different from the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Cloud</a> is treated in his cameo, where both Wol and Echo treat him with suspicion and snark about him together until his merits become apparent.

So you would think this would open a lot of new things, with Isabelle being one of the most useful characters in the game.

</li><li> In season two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, Shiro repeatedly talks about how much he wants Keith to take over the Black Lion and lead Voltron if anything were to happen to him. While Keith isn't a bad pilot, he's very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and hadn't shown many good leadership qualities up to that point. Then in season three, despite the Black Lion accepting him, Keith still gets the team in trouble several times, quickly making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a>. It's ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructedtrope">deconstructed</a> a bit in season four when the other paladins start getting frustrated with him.
