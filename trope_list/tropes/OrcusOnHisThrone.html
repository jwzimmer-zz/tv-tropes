</p><p>Any moment now.
</p><p>Aaaaaany moment...
</p><p>No? Okay, never mind. Looks like we have a case of Orcus on His Throne. A villain with great power and the potential to wipe out the Forces of Good turns out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">awfully retiring</a> sort. Sure, they're out there somewhere being evil, probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy">oppressing someone else</a>, but they don't actually seem to do much; they just sit about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy">resting on their laurels</a> or at most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingpinInHisGym" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingpinInHisGym">maintaining an active training regimen</a>, waiting for the heroes to come and overthrow them. One wonders how they ever mustered the ambition to climb to their position of power in the first place.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Named for a line in the Third Edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> Manual of the Planes, where it mentioned that Orcus, the lord of the undead, might once more be on his throne, one bony hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">clutching his terrible rod</a>. The original justification for this was based in the way <em>D &amp; D</em> works; by not having Orcus (or any other given major villain) actively doing anything, but prepared to strike out against the forces of good, the dungeon masters who were buying the source books and playing the game could have the villains do whatever they wanted or needed them to do for their custom-built campaigns.
</p><p>Relatedly, this is a very common trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a>, where the villain waits passively in their throne room while the hero is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">leveling up</a>, killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">increasing tiers of their minions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Storming the Castle</a>, occupying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">each base</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWait">methodically foiling</a> their plans. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is coming, why not just wait and prepare yourself? But if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is sitting by their Lava Pit of Doom, for whatever reason, just waiting for the Hero to arrive, then of course the Hero has to make their way all the way there.

Then again, what kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> doesn't take the time to smell the roses, pillage a village, and give a hero a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a> every once in a while? They deserve a little "me" time, too!
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> might also be spending all their time offscreen searching for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon">Lost Superweapon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, etc.) that would render conventional means of conquest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">unnecessary</a>. Why waste time and effort commanding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a> when you could conquer/corrupt/destroy the kingdom/country/world/galaxy/universe with the push of a button? Still, it's easier to send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">their minions</a> out to do this instead, which is probably another reason they never have to leave the castle. In the case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad">Non-Action Big Bad</a>, the villain acts like this because personally, they <em>don't</em> have power, or at least not the sort that would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">useful in direct combat</a>, and they primarily work through their subordinates.

Not to be confused with — though principally very similar to—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst">The Pawns Go First</a> for when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> chooses to let their minions fight a particular battle for a while before intervening. Similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy">Offstage Villainy</a>, where we only know the villain is evil because the author says so; with Orcus On His Throne, we only know the villain is <em>dangerous</em> because the author says so. May lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonalWithTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonalWithTheDragon">It's Personal with the Dragon</a>, since if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is spending all his time offscreen seemingly doing nothing, then his enforcers who are doing the work may become the target of the hero's ire. Can be justified if it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">Dark Lord on Life Support</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyDragon">Lazy Dragon</a> is sister trope unique to literal dragons. Can also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> if the villain simply isn't aware of the heroes for some reason.
</p><p>For narrative purposes, an author may deliberately write his archvillian in this way. A Big Bad that is defeated by the heroes in every episode will lose its dramatic effectiveness.

The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Daimaoh is always inside his castle is because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan">Sealed Good in a Can</a> set a spirit barrier around it that damages him if he tries to leave, thus only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Sorges</a> and other minions can go out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sosuke Aizen, despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for much of the series, seems content to wait on the sidelines looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">pretty</a> until he's forced to intervene himself. Upon which he cuts down one of his last remaining Espada himself for failing to defeat even a single Captain before taking the good guys out left and right. It's made clear he just wanted to use his army to force the Gotei 13 onto the battlefield and lessen the amount of people he'd have to personally deal with himself.
</li><li> Of course, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Vandenreich</a> arrive and their leader averts this at first—he sends in the elite fighters first, and *then* the mooks, and on top of that, <em>personally</em> leads the assault on the good guys, a few chapters after he first showed up. They end up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drastically decimating the Gotei 13 and killing their leader, with at most 6 casualties on their own side.</span> However, Yhwach proceeds to play it straight with the second assault, waiting within his palace while letting the Sternritter and foot soldiers fight to the death, and then taking off for the Royal Realm with his elite guard while letting the rest deal with Gotei 13 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and wiping them out himself to power up said elites against the Zero Squad</span>.
</li><li> Baraggan was like this in his backstory, too. He'd consolidated his power in Hueco Mundo so effectively that he had nothing left to do there but sit on his throne, and he was considering dividing his army in two and making them fight just to relieve his boredom. Why he didn't try attacking the Shinigami, the eternal enemies of the Hollows, isn't addressed, though it's implied from his conversation with Aizen and company when they first arrived on his doorstep was that he either didn't care or <em>know</em> that there were worlds beyond Hueco Mundo, or that there was any way to reach them (Soul Society) or if it would even be worth the effort of conquering (Human World).

Devimon separates the kids and instead of killing them himself, he lets his Black Gear-possessed minions do it, while he broods on Infinity Mountain. Vamdemon is perfectly content to let DemiDevimon try to cause strife amongst the Chosen Children instead of attacking them himself (initially), and each Dark Master waits until their comrade has been defeated and the Chosen Children reach their territory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> has Bagramon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">leader of the Bagra army</a>. He doesn't do much for 50 episodes except sit in a chair, looking menacing. In the last 2 episodes he finally takes matters in his own hands, literally.

He finally steps in personally after the deaths of Cymbal and Tambourine, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">beats Goku so thoroughly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">that Goku is presumed dead afterwards</a>. Justified in his case, since he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">still vulnerable to the Mafuba</a>, and he wanted to eliminate everyone who might know it before taking to the field himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Partially for Freeza. Despite being (by a <em>huge</em> margin) the most powerful villain in the series at that point, Freeza mostly just stays in his spaceship while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> do everything, and calls in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> when they fail. However, he did personally fly to the Namekian villages with Zarbon and Dodoria to get the Dragon Balls (albeit in his hoverchair), and also killed three Namekians himself when trying to force one of them to give him the "password" to activate the dragon Porunga (althought that scene was filler).
</li><li> An interesting variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, where Jiren, Universe 11's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">ace</a> in the Tournament of Power, spends most of the time just sitting around or meditating, despite being powerful enough to easily wipe out all of the other teams if he actually felt like it. The few times he actually does fight, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">defeats his opponents with little effort</a>. Somewhat justified in that conserving one's energy is a plot point.

This, despite having (in at least the anime) psychokinetic powers that let him tear through an squadron of Ropponmatsus without the slightest effort, as well as at least some level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>. Among other things, he is unscathed by a half-dozen or so Ropponomatsus latching onto him and self-destructing, catches a mini-missile launched at his face with one hand before throwing it aside like a piece of junk, and zips across the floor too fast to follow and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lifts</a> the original Ropponomatsus... then proceeds to behead them by squeezing his fists shut. In the manga he has various technology-based powers, most notably teleportation, but it takes him over ten volumes to discover most of them due to his amnesia. He is eventually either cured or overtaken by a secondary personality (it's unclear to say the least) and gets off his throne to personally lead the conquest of (the economy of) Fukuoka.

The only thing he does until the day of the eclipse at the end of the series is sitting down in his throne underneath Central City, letting the homunculi carry on his plan. Justified by the reveal that all of those tubes attached to him while he's sitting on that throne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are to maintain a constant pump of Philosopher's Stone just beneath the surface of Amestris, which is what allows him to manipulate their form of alchemy.</span> It's also likely that remaining in Central allows him to keep a direct hand on controlling the government, since Pride (who is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">main go-between</a>) is not capable of leaving the city.
</li><li> Pasdar, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> would sit on his throne, if he had a lower body. Instead he justifies this trope by being a giant grotesquely horrifying mechanical head that's growing out of the ceiling. When he eventually grows a body, it requires a huge amount of energy to do, so much so that he has to assimilate most of Tokyo to do it.

<div class="indent"> "I've read a few stories written by humans. There's quite a few where early on the boss finds out about the existence of the hero or main character. But, the main character was weak, so he didn't think of him as a threat. The boss sends his underlings to finish him off instead. These underlings give the main character the experience he needs. Finally the main character becomes strong enough to defeat the boss with ease. What a comical boss. I don't want it to turn out that way for me. <em>[dodges Qiqi's just accessed trump card: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a satellite laser beam attack</span>]</em> Now it's my turn.

<ul><li> Perhaps not such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, because this was true of Dio even in Part 1.

</li><li> Big Mom's family and crew prides themselves on allowing her to fulfill this trope due to the large number of characters she has at her disposal. Even when one of her dragons is defeated, she can typically just send another one (or an army of them) to beat the victor while the most she does is change the weather.
</li><li> Kaido prefers to stay in his lair on Onigashima and drink rather than patrol the rest of Wano Country. This is good news to those who oppose him, as almost every instance of him getting off his throne to confront an enemy results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> and usually death.

Then we learn that he and the other Desert Apostles are working for Dune, who is far, far away from Earth and is spending his time traveling to Earth. Once he reaches Earth, things go south really quick for the Precures, as he defeats every single one of them easily and manages to wither the Treen of Hearts soon after.

Saffron, the latest incarnation, can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">vaporize mountains with heat beams</a> whenever he feels like it, and yet he suffered an <em>incomplete</em> maturation that deprived him of control.

<ul><li> Queen Beryl was infamous for doing nothing but sitting on her throne and, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381JlMG7DEs">as Unicorn of War put it, fondling her orb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. She only bothered to confront Sailor Moon herself when the heroine infiltrated her base. On top of that, she was <em>weaker</em> than the MOTWs! Justified in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">the manga</a>; Beryl let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst">The Pawns Go First</a> because she didn't care about them and before the Sailor Guardians showed up, their job was to collect energy for Metaria and locate the Silver Crystal while Beryl manned the base (and even then she didn't just sit on her ass all the time and didn't fondle anything). Subverted later: Beryl was the one who confronted the heroines at <em>their</em> base.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wiseman was just using the Black Moon Clan anyway, but still comes off like this in the anime, though not as bad as Beryl. In particular, he initially presented himself and Death Phantom as two different beings only for it to be revealed in the last episode that they were the same. Also something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlothole">Adaptation Induced Plothole</a>: in the manga, Death Phantom was a notorious criminal on Earth that Neo-Queen Serenity banished to Nemesis, so he had a reason to keep his distance from the heroes at first and manipulate like-minded people into doing his dirty work, lest he be recognized and risk his entire attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a> falling apart.</span>
</li><li> Mistress 9 and Professor Tomoe of Infinity/S. Justified in both the anime and manga. Tomoe's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> who's also completely crazy in S (though him being in charge of Kaolinite and the Witches 5 isn't justified), Mistress 9 has yet to truly awaken for most of the season (or at all in the manga; it's feared she'll never awaken there). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By extension, there is Pharaoh 90, their master who was trapped in another dimension (though he was a surprise villain in the anime).</span>
</li><li> Justified in the anime for Queen Nehelenia as she would like nothing more than to go down there and slap the Sailor Guardians into oblivion all on her own. But she's trapped in the mirror dimension until the last few episodes of the season, so all she can do is deliver orders to her underlings on Earth.
</li><li> The final arc/season of the series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> and <em>not</em> letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawnsGoFirst">The Pawns Go First</a> would've ruined Galaxia's entire plan. She was also toying with Sailor Moon the entire time and was explicitly waiting for her to confront her at her base, <em>especially</em> in the manga. Though her reasons for wanting to kill all the Sailor Guardians in the galaxy differs widely between anime and manga.

Except he never tried breaking out until AFTER the barrier maiden had discovered the power to keep him there, which is three hundred years (five hundred in the dub). And he does absolutely nothing during that time. This is the result of a second-season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> that revealed him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> Head, the temporary leader of Kiraboshi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver">Star Driver</a></em>, began to show such tendencies relatively early, going as far as even taking a break from his "duties" halfway into the series. Better yet, as soon as Kiraboshi breaks the second maiden seal, reaches Third Phase and his faction seizes complete control over the organisation, he begins to actively stall their progress by withholding information. Of course, it's all part of his plan, since he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">needs Keito to convince Sugata to join Kiraboshi and waits for his old lover Shingo to wake up from his long coma to give him the mark that is a vital part of his grand scheme</span>.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Anti-Spiral King</span> doesn't even show up until the penultimate episode and doesn't directly fight the heroes until the final one.

Averted in the later parts of the manga, however.
</li><li> Great Demon King Chestra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolinistOfHameln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolinistOfHameln">Violinist of Hameln</a></em> follows this trope in letter, but not in spirit. He stays on his throne until his crippled body regenerates both legs, yet this does not prevent him from bringing his magic to bear against armies that challenge his minions as soon as he appears in the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>.
<ul><li> Takuma Saiou, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Season Two. Barely any of his interactions with the main cast serve any purpose throughout the first half of the season. Halfway, he gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">weapon of mass destruction</a> that allows him to destroy the world, and he literally spends days doing nothing but contemplating whether he should destroy the world or not and he pretty much falls out of focus, until some weird split personality crisis makes him give away the keys to the satellite to the heroes. (Ironically, his record as a duelist onscreen was better than any previous main antagonist, with four wins, one loss. Two losses if you count Season Four.)
</li><li> Minor example was Yuri Edogawa (called simply "Czar" in the dub) of North Academy who did nothing but sit in a rocking chair and watch when Manjoume went through the school's "hazing ritual" where he had to defeat 50 duelists in a row; after he finally <em>does</em> get off his behind, Manjoume defeats him easily, and calls him out for pretty much doing nothing. (Edogawa tried to justify this by saying that watching him duel 49 times let him memorize Manjoume's entire deck, but he still missed the two cards Manjoume used to defeat him.)

Justified by his obsession with the "Anti-life Equation", a formula that removes the free will of anyone that hears it.

The university exists to give wizards something to do other than trying to kill each other, or at least <em>structure</em> the killing to reduce collateral damage. Wizards are forbidden to marry (and are implied to be bound to chastity) because the eighth son of an eighth son is a wizard, but the eighth son of the eighth son of an eighth son is a Sourcerer with access to magic as far beyond wizards as wizards are beyond, say, CMOT Dibbler. Sourcerers eventually fall into Orcus-on-his-throne-itude because reality pretty much reshapes itself around their whims so they don't <em>have</em> to do anything, and those that aren't killed by their peers wind up just getting bored and going ... elsewhere.

</li><li> Leaving King's Landing <em>would</em> be political suicide, as it would be easy for another aspirant to the crown to take control of the region in his absence. As pointed out by Tywin, the only (other) reason Joffrey is considered more than a "claimant" to the Iron Throne is because he physically sits on it.
</li></ul></li><li> For all his talk about "I take what is mine", Balon hasn't actually left Pyke in his campaign to conquer the North. So far only his children have done any actual fighting and conquering.
</li></ul></li><li> Arthur Petrelli from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> gained practically godlike power in the first few episodes he appeared in. After that he spent most of his time sitting in his base, drawing pretty pictures and sending out his incompetent minions occasionally. You'd think an unkillable guy with power over time and space could be a bit more proactive. Admittedly he thought he already had everything he needed for his master plan, and when he found out that he was lacking the last component of the formula for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a> he wanted to make... he and the rest of the cast were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> that same episode, so he couldn't use his powers to get it.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> doesn't do this trope much due to how their villains are structured, they do fall for this trope occasionally, though these reasons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze">Kamen Rider Fourze</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> not do anything while his loyal Horoscopes do the work for him. Justified because he doesn't really care if they live or die, provided that their Switch is intact so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he can invoke the Dark Nebula</span>. Though it's only when it gets close to the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after he mortally wounds his dragon when he realizes the latter's double life</span> that he manages to kick the heroes' asses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a></em> subverts this trope. The Wiseman can actually just zap away the mana from Haruto <em>on his throne</em> (really, it's a stone bed thing but still), ensuring he won't be defeated easily. He still sits on his throne and lets his mooks do the work for him, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he does do stuff when he's the White Wizard.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDragonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDragonKnight">Kamen Rider Dragon Knight</a></em>: Despite having all the means to get things done in a short time and with little effort, Xaviax preffers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">scheme</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">recruit</a> people to fight for him rather than get his hands dirty. He runs out of proxies eventually and his love for power and threatics finally come to bite him when toying with the protagonists gives them enough time to recover and prepare a counter attack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> in general has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> who subscribe to this trope. Sometimes they have a reason for this; other times, however, they're content to sit around and berate their underlings' continual failures until the final five episodes or so.
<ul><li> Lord Zedd from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> is one of the most egregious examples of this; he's been shown to be capable of clobbering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Tommy</a> with little effort, but spends most of his time sending ineffective minions after the rangers and yelling at everybody.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Power Rangers Operation Overdrive</a></em> had Flurious, the smartest and most powerful of the four competing factions of enemies attacking the Rangers that season. After being a major threat in the first three episodes, he spends the next 27 lazing around in his arctic base, letting the other villains do all the work. It isn't until the finale that he swoops in and attempts to make a grab for victory.
</li><li> Lothor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm">Power Rangers Ninja Storm</a></em> is indeed <em>very</em> powerful, just not quite powerful <em>enough</em> to carry out his ultimate plan, so he deliberately plays up this trope <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and sending monsters and generals to their deaths just to fill up the abyss of evil so he can absorb that power once it overflows.</span>
</li><li> Justified in the case of Venjix of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>, a computer virus inhabiting a hard-drive cylinder. Once he builds a robot body, he starts to have a more active role.
</li><li> Master Xandred of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>. He has a good reason for staying in the lair (he'd dry out and die in minutes if he crossed over to the human world) and he gets more active later, but in the early episodes he didn't even do any scheming; he just spent most of his time saying "Yeah, do whatever; I need some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater">medicine</a> for this freakin' headache." The first time he enters the human world he dries up rather quickly forcing him to return to the Sanzu River, but he was able to get around this by absorbing Dayu becoming half-human and not dry up like last time. Still, rather than his two fight scenes (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> basically being a really long fight scene)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> has the Ultimate Alliance of Evil, composed of every one of the series villains. All they ever seemed to do was throw parties for themselves. Even Astronoma, who took command of assaulting Earth, played this role, however, she did participate in battle against the Rangers more often than her predecessors. That being said, they shook it off with a vengeance in the series finale, where they launched a coordinated assault on the entire universe. They defeated the Rangers and all their allies very quickly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and required a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a> from Zordon to lose.</span>
</li><li> Dark Specter might be the worst example of this in the series. He's portrayed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> for all of the Zordon-era villains (Rita, Zedd, The Machine Empire, Divatox, Astronema, etc.). Sadly, he never once fights the Power Rangers, and he never <em>does anything</em> other than give orders/make idle threats, and spends the entire season being unknowingly plotted against by his subordinates. In Part 1 of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> he's killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>, though to his credit he at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">takes him down too</a>.
</li><li> In a somewhat literal example, the Big Bad of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Megaforce</a></em>, Emperor Mavro, is confronted by the Red and Silver Rangers and considers them so beneath his attention that he actually sits down and claims that he can beat them without standing up. He then proceeds to deliver an almost effortless smackdown to the heroes without standing up.
</li></ul></li><li> This applies to almost half of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>' parent show; they spend most of their screen time in the show in their throne, sitting like a living furniture, and only get off their asses in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> to fight the heroes in giant form.
</li><li> Basically, both franchises have the villain division of labor being such that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> doesn't go out and punch things like a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> every single week (and thus lose street cred by being seen defeated over and over and over.) Rather, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s job to run the operation, coming up with plans, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> is there when you need someone to keep the Rangers distracted while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> kicks puppies and the Putty Patrol isn't enough. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad">Non-Action Big Bad</a> like Lord Zedd or Venjix who runs the operation competently, casts the occasional spell or builds the occasional weapon, and shows you now and again just why the minions are so loyal/terrified/both, but leaves the fisticuffs to the season's Goldar type isn't necessarily an unimpressive one. However, you've got a few villains whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">stated badassery is never proven</a> and they do nothing until the final episode, where their admittedly impressive combat powers still make them seem like "really strong monster of the week" rather than "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> and author of everyone's troubles." And that's how a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">red light on a pole</a> can be the franchise's <em>most</em> competent villain and an incredibly powerful fighter like Xandred can be the franchise's <em>least.</em>
<ul><li> <em>Operation Overdrive</em>'s Flurious seems to be in keeping with <em>Boukenger</em>, in which Gajah (the villain Flurious essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">replaced</a>) mostly winds up hanging back, only really doing anything of significance after one of the other factions has one of their plans fail, in at least one case using the flaming wreckage of the failed plan as the foundation for his own. And then he turns out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> after showing up sporadically.
</li><li> You know we said about Master Xandred above? His <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Samurai Sentai Shinkenger</a></em> counterpart, Chimatsuri Dokoku, is the same, only he's not taking medicine — that's <em>sake</em> and he spends all his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">drinking himself into a stupor</a> instead of commanding his minions, <em>without</em> the excuse of constant pain from the previous generation's attempt at permanently sealing him.
</li><li> Star King Bazoo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DengekiSentaiChangeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DengekiSentaiChangeman">Dengeki Sentai Changeman</a></em>, at least has a justification for staying on his throne: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's just buying time until his real form arrives and allows him to destroy Earth.</span>
</li><li> Dogranio Yabun kickstarted the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaitouSentaiLupinrangerVSKeisatsuSentaiPatranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaitouSentaiLupinrangerVSKeisatsuSentaiPatranger">Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger</a></em> by declaring his intention of retiring and letting whoever conquers the Earth be his successor. As such, him fighting <em>or</em> planning would defeat the purpose of the whole exercise. But after watching countless members of this criminal syndicate be defeated by the heroes, he began to have serious doubts about his original plan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After his right hand man Destra falls in combat, Dogranio finally to take matters on his own hands. Sadly for him, those years of sitting on his ass and letting his Collection powers do all the work has left him aged and out of practice. Once all his Collection pieces are removed, his remaining might, while still nothing to sneeze at, isn't enough to stave off defeat from the Patrangers. To top it all, unlike all the main Super Sentai villains series, Dogranio was not killed by the heroes after his final defeat but he received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">A Fate Worse Than Death</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">he was imprisoned in an underground maximum security cell for the rest of his, presumably very long, lifespan</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, drug lord Avon Barksdale has this trope forced on him by his colleagues. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> is that if he never touches drugs, money, or guns, and he doesn't meet with his underlings in the field, he becomes very difficult to prosecute. Until Jimmy McNulty stirs up a crusade against him, most police have never even heard of him, and they have a very difficult time digging up any intel or even a physical description. In contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Stringer Bell</a> does and says plenty in the course of running the gang, though he is likewise very careful about it. A lampshade is hung on it in the scene where D'Angelo teaches his dealers the rules of chess; they liken Avon to the king and Stringer to the queen. Ironically, however, when an arrest finally comes at the end of season one, Avon is charged while Stringer (to his own surprise) is left free for the moment. After Avon returns from prison, the roles are somewhat reversed. Stringer wants to run the gang like a business and keep a low profile, but Avon insists there are good reasons to war with Marlo Stanfield and leads personally. It directly causes him to return to prison.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Orcus</a>, of course, through most of his history. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, in that not only is he in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a> war with various other Demon Lords, but also with the Fallen Devils as well. Back in First and Second Edition however he was a real terror; first he died, then he came back from the dead, terrorized the planes, killed a bunch of gods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder">nobody cares about</a>, and died again. He hasn't been the same since his second resurrection. In 4th Edition, Orcus is fully statted out for combat in the Monster Manual. Clearly he's gotten a bit more active if he needs epic-level heroes to face him. What's more, he's not only the most powerful monster in that book, but he got himself put on the cover.
</li><li> Asmodeus' was badly wounded during his fall from heaven, so his avatar can't go far from the hells for long periods of time, and he is enough of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> that he doesn't have to do leave hell to be the dangerous creature in in the multiverse. 4e offers another justification for Asmodeus; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Hell is his prison</a> and he can't leave. It's worth noting that he wasn't imprisoned there to protect the mortal world from him, but to protect the other gods from him. He became a god through deicide, and the other gods are scared shitless of him (and potential copycats).
</li><li> Orcus' arch rival Demogorgon tends to do the same thing. His excuse is that he considers the wars with devils and other demons a necessary annoyance, and his true interest is researching the nature of the Abyss. For the record? Demogorgon is said canonically to be more powerful than Orcus, and at least in some versions, was the demonic equivalent of Asmodeus himself.

Ironically, the original <em>Ravenloft</em> module completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a> this trope — the vampire lord Strahd has spies looking out for you when you invade his castle, and if he knows where you are and you linger too long in one area, he <em>will</em> attack you and try to kill you rather than wait for you to find him, and on top of that the game randomises where the final battle with him is supposed to take place so rather than finding him on his throne, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">you have no idea when and where you will run into him</a>. He'll also have multiple social interactions with the party long before then, safe in the knowledge they're no real threat to him.

Somewhat justified, in that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Neverborn</a> masters really hate failure and have dolled out some nasty punishments already; if one of them's going to come up with a fiendish plan to destroy Creation, they're going to make damn sure it <em>works</em> first. Additionally, they all want to be the one to destroy the world themselves, which means they spend a lot of time keeping an eye on each other to make sure no-one else gets the glory. (Some treatments, such as Eye and Seven Despairs, or the Lover have been presented as being more interested in the distractions and satisfactions of existence, and have strayed from the path of seeking Oblivion as anything other than lip service.) This, more than any other reason, is likely why the Neverborn have deliberately set about having the Death Lords unknowingly train their own replacements (that being the Abyssal Exalted).

<ul><li> God comes across like this. His hand will appear in small ways through Divine Intervention, but He's not taking the field personally till Armageddon — he's only communicated with angels at all twice since the Fall.
</li><li> Lucifer, meanwhile, plays with the trope. He is quite active both in Infernal Interventions and in maintaining Hell's hierarchy, but he doesn't personally involve himself in the fight against Heaven — he spends more time judging his inferiors' success instead. Nonetheless, he can pop up whenever he wants — even if he just happens to wander by and open a stuck door for demons (though this should only happen in a more comedic campaign). He also sometimes speaks to angels, and is rarely openly hostile toward them (though that doesn't mean that that angel isn't now in very serious trouble).

Powerful evil spellcasters who have achieved immortality, and thus have all the time in the world to discover even <em>more</em> powerful magic, along with the additional powers their undead state grants? They should be ruling the world, right? While it's true that many start out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> ambitions, as the centuries pass the concerns of the mortal world matter less and less to them.

Eventually they may cease to function entirely and become barely sentient (though incredibly powerful) <em>demi</em>liches.
<ul><li> Kevoth-Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, is a justified example of this trope. He's a powerful and dangerous barbarian king who conquered the throne of Starfall by force, but these days he never leaves his palace because the <em>real</em> power in Starfall, the Technic League, keep him drugged and distracted so they can run the show. The game's second edition reveals that after the Technic League's destruction in <em>Iron Gods</em> he becomes a much more proactive and effective ruler.

<ul><li> Of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">daemon Primarchs</a> only a handful have left their daemonworlds and attacked the Imperium on a regular basis. Mostly because they don't actually give a crap about the Imperium anymore; they have godlike powers and rule entire worlds that are shaped according to their whims, so they have very little reason to leave their homes and go kick some mortals around. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Angron</a>, the most active, is a bit different as he exists to kill things, and mortals are more fun to kill than demons (as demons can't truly die). And it takes an enormous amount of energy to actually summon them to the physical world... and every time poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror">Magnus the Red</a> ventures out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">the Space Wolves stab him in the eye</a>. This goes double Lorgar and Fulgrim. Every other daemon-primarch assaulted the Imperium at least once. Lorgar has spent the last ten thousand years meditating on the nature of Chaos, while the Word Bearers are ruled by his lieutenants. Fulgrim left his legion shortly after Horus Heresy and even the Emperor's Children can't find him. The Emperor's Children no longer have any kind of unified command structure after that incident with World Eaters, Kharn and a flamethrower.
</li><li> Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">Twin Switch</a> antics, it's ambiguous as to whether Alpharius is alive, whether his twin brother Omegon is alive, or whether they're both alive. Whatever the answer is, they haven't been heard of in ten thousand years.
</li><li> The Emperor is effectively sustained by life support on his throne, and has been for ten millennia. He's <em>less</em> of a villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">but this is WH40K we're talking about</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">The Chaos Gods</a>, when they aren't stuck in their literally eternal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>, rely on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">daemons</a> and mortal followers to cause havoc in the Materium. In their case they're just <strong>so</strong> powerful that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">they physically can't manifest in or influence the Materium in any way</a>. Their ultimate goal is to permanently merge the Materium and Immaterium, which would give them free reign over everything.
</li><li> Fanon interpretations strike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">Khorne</a> particularly hard with this trope, referring to him as a particularly lazy slob who won't simply stand up and start spilling some blood himself. This is partly due to the "SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE" part of the infamous warcry, which leads to interpreting him as really loving that throne too much to leave it, and because every other god seems to be doing <em>something</em> in their wait: Tzeentch keeps weaving plan after plan, Slaanesh spends time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">murderfucking Eldar souls for eternity</a>, and Nurgle continually brews new plagues, and even if he were fully idle at least his domain justifies it. Khorne, whose domain would expect more activity than any of the other three, does nothing of the sort, and apparently all he does is watch his servants fight everyone forever, with only the occasional gift to a powerful warrior. Thus, as impressive as his servants are, the God himself ends up coming off as less of an unstoppable force of violence and more of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/IfTheEmperorHadATextToSpeechDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/IfTheEmperorHadATextToSpeechDevice">paraplegic sociopath</a>".
</li><li> Asdrubael Vect, ruler of the Dark Eldar, is an <em>in-game example</em>. His model is a floating open-topped tank, which he's had a throne installed on, and while there are rules for him leaving the vehicle he's very expensive, so doesn't get to go out in person much. In the lore he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>, so it's justified that he doesn't get stuck in all that often.

It's implied that the villain of the first game, the Dragonlord, has all but won and probably isn't aware that someone is seeking out the armor and sword that can help kill him, so he has no reason to leave his base at Charlock Castle. Likewise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em>, Zoma has already <em>won</em> and there are no threats left to go out and eliminate.

However, much like the Dragonlord and Zoma before him, once he gets what he wants he mostly remains at his fortress while letting his forces wreak havoc.

There's also how every enemy agent will be gunning for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, so the best bet is to put him deep in the belly of the lair. At most, you can have him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">execute a random minion</a> for a quick stats boost of all those nearby.

The few times he does come face-to-face he's even quite friendly towards him and the worst he does is have him thrown in a cell up in the Himalayas. Of course, he has a reason: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ajay is the son of his former lover, who he sees as a son himself that he was prepared to give Kyrat to.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">becoming a god</a>, ruining the world and wiping out many cities, he doesn't exactly do much afterwards, at least nothing the player is made aware of.

Then the Returners stormed his tower and he decided pissing on the ashes of the world wasn't fun anymore. There's also the theory that he was so bored for that year he actively waited for the heroes to band back together and fight them one last time because really, when you become an all-powered God of Magic who rules a dead world, what else is there to do but smack down anyone who opposes your rule?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>, Chaos does remarkably little for being the God of Discord and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of, possibly, the entire series. Sure, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nukes Cosmos</span> that one time, but aside from that one moment, he spends the game doing an impressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlouchOfVillainy">Slouch of Villainy</a> on his throne until someone finally shows up to fight him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's mostly because the endless repeating cycles of his war with Cosmos have burned him out to the point that he just doesn't <em>care</em> any more.

They basically just sit there as you wipe out their minions. Although sitting on thrones gives them a large boost in their stats — they can dodge better, tank better, and thrones even <strong>heal</strong> them — this makes defeating them much easier due to their very limited range (in fact, some such enemies don't even have a ranged attack, so by doing nothing but sitting on the thrones you can easily pick them off from a distance).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia">Shadow Dragon</a></em> justifies it in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Medeus: his resurrection is not yet fully complete, and as a result he is physically incapable of leaving his castle.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, Grima is an example from a story perspective. Grima ultimately does very little to contribute to the conflict besides resurrect Validar, with his subordinates Validar and Aversa doing most of the work.
</li><li> Sometimes the game subverts this. Every once in a while, there will be a boss that'll sit there until one of your units comes into attacking range. Hope you didn't send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath">your healer</a> first. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lloyd</span> is an especially nasty one in Blazing Sword.

And if you send a knight to absorb the hit, he'll take magic damage from his lightbrand, probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaDeath">kicking the bucket</a> in the process. Thankfully, this is only on hector mode. The trope is played straight in Eliwood's story.

Zephon is fused with the wall and literally cannot move from his "throne room". Rahab can only move underwater and is extremely vulnerable to sunlight, while Raziel cannot enter the waters, and mostly roams well-enough lit areas, for Rahab to be uncomfortable tracking him down.

The implication, of course, is that Wily is controlling his various Robot Masters to take over the world. When Mega Man inevitably defeats them, he barricades himself in his massive, well-defended fortress, hoping it will be enough to keep the Blue Bomber away. Through the magic of video game protagonist determinism, it never is.

And although they are directly responsible for the entire premise of the game and pretty much everything about its setting, they do not directly influence <em>any</em> of the action during much of the game itself.

Several aliens point out that the Scryve have become decadent and lazy by the time of the game, so their slowness and general incompetence is attributed to this; it's implied that if humanity had encountered the Scryve at the height of their power, they would never have had a chance.

Nevertheless, considering that he knows that you and Bastila are by far the biggest threats to him and his ultimate victory, and that he knows, or should know, exactly where you are going on your quest, it is more than a little strange that he does not bother coming after you personally when he knows that you are still relatively weak.

<ul><li> When Xykon is first introduced he appears to be this, sitting down in his lair waiting for the heroes to arrive (and watching them on his crystal ball, with picture-in-picture for when the party gets split up). However, after his defeat, he becomes a <em>much</em> more proactive villain. But then he goes back to warming the seat on his throne (in a manner of speaking; he's a bone-cold lich) after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">conquering Azure City</span>. He explicitly states that even crafting magical items takes up only 8 hours of his day, and, for lack of anything else to do, he has taken to offbeat torture of his prisoner, forcing gladiatorial sport on his slaves, and has developed a liking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGladiators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGladiators">Zombie Gladiators</a>. Xykon stated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a></em> that, with the immortality of lichdom, time is on his side, and he can afford to dilly-dally as much as he wants.
</li><li> Later subverted when it's revealed that Redcloak manipulated Xykon to spend more time in the city they'd conquered, since Redcloak was trying to turn it into a new goblin citystate and needed time to get it to where it could handle Redcloak being gone. Xykon eventually gets sick of waiting after his favorite prisoner to torture is broken out and forces Redcloak to get ready to leave to get going on the rest of their quest for the gates.
</li><li> Subverted again when they arrive at the desert gate. Xykon is furious to see that the heroes beat them there and the gate is destroyed, and decides to just kill the whole party then and there. However, The Monster in the Darkness recognizes the party as friends of his friend O'Chul, and tricks Xykon into letting them live and hurrying on to the next gate instead.
</li><li> Nale sees his father Tarquin as an example of this and resents him for it. He doesn't understand why his father is content to spend his dwindling days in the lap of luxury when he has the resources and skill to conquer the world and rule it forever. Although from Tarquin's point of view, it's entirely reasonable, as he's a very active Chessmaster <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is actually constantly expanding and reinforcing his empire though an elaborate continent-wide campaign of manipulation.</span>

</li><li> In Season 3, finally he leaves his hideout in the Hawk Moth costume and without a plan, because he needed to save his right-hand woman Mayura from getting defeated and captured by the heroes, she was reckless and left the hideout without talking to him, not only he genuinely cares for her, but if he didn't show up, he would lose a Miraculous, and Mayura would be unmasked and raise suspiction since without costumes, she is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his secretary.</span>

Blue is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">too caught up mourning</a> the assassination of Pink to lead, and White <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">never leaves her throne room/ship</a>, instead having White Pearl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthOfSauron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthOfSauron">act as her voice in all matters</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperforceGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperforceGo">Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Skeleton King</a> spends the entire first season never leaving his throne aboard his fortress/ship, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair">Citadel of Bone</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope">Justified</a>, as we find out he's linked to the place and literally <em>can't</em> leave. After its destruction at the start of Season 2, however, it's averted, as he's now free to move about and be more active.
</li><li> General Mudula fills this role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, sending monsters and mooks after the protagonists but not bothering to go after them personally. However it's quite justified since he's too busy managing his new empire and crushing rebellions to be bothered to chase after three measly enemies, regardless of how important they are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>: For all his faults, Shredder does <em>not</em> have this problem. Krang, on the other hand, does. While a couple of episodes show he's more than capable of fighting physically, he rarely leaves the control room of the Technodrome, letting Shredder and the "gruesome twosome" do the dirty work.
</li><li> Mumm-Ra, in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats">Thunder Cats</a></em>, rarely leaves his citadel, except when powered up into Mumm-Ra the Everliving, and even then he can't bear to spend much time away from it. Justified when it turns out that the "Ancient Spirits of Evil" are either bound by unbreakable arcane laws or else major-league <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a>; they will grant the power that Mumm-Ra uses to become Mumm-Ra the Everliving to <em>anyone</em> who stands in the mystical chamber and invokes them in the proper manner. As proven when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature">Snarf</a></em> does so and becomes "Snarf-Ra the Everliving". Also, Mumm-Ra cannot survive outside of his coffin for more than 24 hours.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> episode "Triple Takeover", Blitzwing makes a football stadium his new headquarters and has the Constructicons build a giant highway maze around it. He then gets the Autobots' attention by firing into the city. He then waits in the stadium for the Autobots to come to him, occasionally sending the Constructicons into the maze to deal with them. By the time they finally reach him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance">they're exhausted and injured</a>, and he casually tramples them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopAMountainOfCorpses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopAMountainOfCorpses">makes a throne from their bodies</a>.
</li><li> During the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, Megatron could have left the underground base of operations he'd set up any time he wanted, and there was no one on Earth who could stand in his way. But Earth didn't interest him, nor did going out of his way to kick around a lowly Autobot repair crew. In fact, Megatron stayed in not because he was taking it easy, but because he had a project in the works that he intended to use to bypass Cybertron's defenses, and it kept him too busy to go out.
</li><li> Lord Zarkon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em> doesn't bother personally chasing down Team Voltron despite being immensely powerful even without his army backing him up. Justified, as he's managing an empire and doesn't really have time to run off after a single group of enemies. Further he's not exactly worried about being unable to find the heroes, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he used to be the Black Lion's paladin and still has some connection to it, allowing him to figure out where the team is anytime he wants.</span> Further he would actually prefer it if the team <em>did</em> get past his minions and reach him since that would give him a chance to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reclaim control of the Black Lion; while he wouldn't be able to form Voltron, neither would the heroes which, combined with the Black Lion's power, would be a pretty good consolation prize.</span>
<ul><li> Averted with his son Lotor.
</li></ul></li><li> Lord Darkar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> is initially active, nearly killing Aisha and freeing the Trix, but he then spends the rest of the time scheming in his castle and operating through minions.
</li><li> Prince Phobos of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>. This becomes a plot point in the second season finale- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Guardians are trying to lure him to a place that will rob his powers if he enters, but he throws a wrench in that plan by simply being too lazy- or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Raythar</a> puts it, "doesn't want to muss his hair"- to leave his throne room until his forces are victorious.</span>
