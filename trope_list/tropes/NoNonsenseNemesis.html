<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo">Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</a></em>, the biggest enemy to a Hajike/Wiggin' Specialist is one who identifies themselves as a Legendary Idiot/Joke Killer. They have extreme prejudice towards anything considered nonsensical or silly and destroy anyone who so much as cracks a joke. If they so much as sense the slightest bit of idiocy or ridiculousness from someone, they'll attack them with full force.
<ul><li> The main example being Torpedo Girl who is this to such an extent she even hurt her father, Landmine Dandy, for this back when she was a child. Granted, she is prone to her own eccentricity (such as her "I'm a torpedo" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>) She does still end up being defeated back when she's an antagonist by being <em>overwhelmed</em> with cosmic levels of absurdity.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Torpedo Girl</strong>: I can't win. These guys are so obtuse, there is no logical way to defeat them.
</div></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt's</span> death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is this. He is chased and cornered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> and explains that they aren't going to shoot him because they'll need to interrogate him. They shoot him to death immediately, with one remarking that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt</span> was obviously stalling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frieza is one when he is being methodical, or when he is pushed to his limits. <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> reveals that he gathered all the Saiyans in Planet Vegeta to exterminate them all with his planet. Of course, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">overconfidence and sadism</a> tend to limit this trait when he fights personally.
<ul><li> Once Goku arrives back on Earth to fight him, Frieza makes it clear in no uncertain terms he's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem">playing around like on Namek</a> and immediately jumps from Form 1 to his final and true form for battle. Subverted in that he <em>could</em> have just immediately gone Golden and finished Goku then and there, Super Saiyan Blue be damned, but instead does not go Golden until he needs to and from that moment on once more starts playing around with Goku, depleting his own stamina instead of finishing Goku off because he wants to see Goku suffer <em>that</em> much. Naturally, it blows up in his face, again. He's wised up some by the Tournament of Power.
</li></ul></li><li> Cell is this while imperfect — as he knows he is too weak to win against his stronger foes without gaining power, he instead deliberately and mercilessly kills to gain power. When fighting those he knows he can defeat, he methodically goes after anyone who makes themselves a threat — once he is struck by anyone entering the fight he immediately makes sure they can't return later to screw up his plans before continuing his main goal. After he becomes Perfect, however, he starts holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a> more often. Given that the likes of Goku and Vegeta were used as sources for his DNA, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> nature is literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> for Cell, and once he's complete he just can't hold it back anymore.
<ul><li> Cell gains some of this back after regenerating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> and becoming Super Perfect. Upon returning to Earth, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shots</a> Trunks before the dust even clears, and after nearly killing Vegeta and crippling Gohan's arm, outright declares that he's through playing games and anything less than complete universal destruction is a waste of his power.
</li></ul></li><li> Future Trunks is a rare heroic example. Unlike most of the other heroes, he doesn't hold back to make things fun, he fights at full force from the beginning. He finishes off Frieza on Earth without letting him find a chance to severely damage the Saiyan. When he gets back to the future, he kills 17 and 18 in that timeline without wasting significant time, permanently preventing Cell from achieving his perfect form in that timeline. He also destroyed Cell at his weakest. It's also revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> that when his timeline's incarnations of Babidi and Dabura arrived on Earth hoping to awaken Majin Buu, he unhesitatingly destroyed them both without letting them come anywhere close to doing so.
</li><li> Speaking of which, Goku himself also occasionally takes this tack, mostly against Cell and Super/Kid Buu. Cell he just tried to kill from the start, and against Super Buu, he did everything possible to <em>avoid</em> a fair fight (including fusing with Vegeta) from the beginning, while he only reached this conclusion with Kid Buu when he realised that reasoning with him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">was no longer an option whatsoever.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Goku is given a second chance with Frieza due to Whis rewinding time before he destroyed Earth, Goku goes straight to obliterating Frieza and making sure he's actually dead, as opposed to Namek.</span>
</li><li> Once Super Buu enters the fray, his first move (after gruesomely killing a bystander) is to fly straight to Kami's Lookout and demand that Piccolo present the "worthy opponent" that he had been promised (Gotenks). When Piccolo tries to stall for time by pointing out that there are people left on Earth for Buu to kill, Buu immediately annihilates just about every bystander left on the planet Earth with an energy wave he calls the "Human Extinction" attack, to the horror of everyone. He then demands, with no further distractions, to see his opponent. He later declares that, even if Goku and Gohan were to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fuse</a>, they still couldn't defeat him, but then immediately adds that he isn't going to take the chance and will just kill them now to be certain.
</li><li> Kid Buu one-ups even Super Buu. Instead of fighting the heroes, he simply blows up the entire planet, knowing that he can regenerate from almost anything. Goku and Vegeta are forced to fight Kid Buu on the world of the Kais because it's one of the few planets he can't oneshot. In fact, even though Kid Buu isn't as strong as Super Buu, he's considered far more dangerous as unlike Super Buu, Kid Buu can't be reasoned with, and doesn't care about a good fight; he just wants to destroy everything for its own sake.
</li><li> King Piccolo from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series. His first order of business upon his return is to kill all the world's martial artists so no-one can ever seal him again and collect the Dragon Balls to wish for youth. Upon finding out that two of his children are killed, he goes and deals with the threat directly and nearly kills Goku, even checks his heart to make sure he was dead. He allows the other heroes to collect the remaining Dragon Balls and swallowed his so they couldn't steal them. When he was about to make his wish Chiaotzu attempted to interrupt, only to be quickly killed. Once he regained his youth, he kills the Eternal Dragon so no one could ever use the Dragon Balls against him. There's a reason he remains the only villain in the series to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">win</a>, only losing in the end because he never counted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Goku's heart restarting after he left</a>.
</li><li> Although not as ruthless as the above villains, Mercenary Tao. Being a professional assassin, he more often than not goes for quick kills. When Goku proved to be durable against physical blows, he attempts to pierce his heart with a finger beam. His only true mistake was not checking Goku's body.
</li><li> King Cold, Frieza's father. When he and Mecha-Frieza went to Earth to get revenge on Goku, Cold suggested just blowing the planet up from orbit; it was Frieza who adamantly insisted on landing and personally killing everyone there to make Goku suffer. Since Future Trunks shows up and kills the two of them shortly after, Frieza should have gone with Cold's plan.
</li><li> Vegeta becomes this on the rare occasions he's not letting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">ego</a> get the best of him. In the Namek Saga, he quickly kills the members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Ginyu Force</a> when Goku chooses not to do so, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em>, he outright tells Frieza that he's nowhere near as merciful as Goku and <em>won't</em> give Frieza the chance to walk away.
</li><li> Syn/Omega Shenron, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>. He attacks Goku when he's exhausted and weak from fighting Nuova and Eis. Later, when Goku and Vegeta fuse into Gogeta and nearly kill him only for the Fusion time to wear out, he does everything he possibly can to prevent them from fusing again.
</li><li> Beerus, God of Destruction of 7th universe. He does like fighting and sees Goku and Vegeta as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponents</a>, but when he's on the job, he is swift and merciless. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zamasu assassinating Gowasu (undone by a time rewind) and attacking Goku</span> gets him swiftly stopped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Hakai</a>'d. No banter, no fight, just obliteration.

Unlike most villains who toy with their opponents, Goku Black is a ruthless mass-murderer who focuses solely on killing opponents as quickly and efficiently as possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's best shown in his fight with Goku and Vegeta in the future. After letting Vegeta wail on him for a while to show how much stronger he's become since his last fight with Goku, he then knocks him away, transforms into his new Super Saiyan Rose form and swiftly impales Vegeta in the chest with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a>. Later, he double teams Goku and Trunks with Future Zamasu rather than let him handle things himself, the two of them nearly killing Goku and Trunks had it not been for Vegeta, Future Mai, and Future Yajirobe.</span>

</li><li> Hit is a renowned assassin who will not toy around with his targets, preferring to end his battles or kill his targets as efficiently as possible. At least, until he finds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>. This is shown perfectly in episode 71 when we see him in the middle of a hit job on a local crime boss. He uses Time Skip to bypass all the boss' security guards and reach his target, calmly tells said target that he's hired to kill him, then promptly punches a hole through said target's chest, ignoring his pleas for mercy and killing him instantly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when he fights Goku again, he lets Goku hit him a few times to showcase his intangibility powers, then promptly punches him through the heart, killing him instantly.</span>
</li><li> Piccolo has identified that not being this is the biggest flaw possessed by Goku and Gohan, as they consistently drop their guard due to arrogance and their own certainty in their power, and both of them have been beaten as a result (Goku vs Frieza, Gohan vs Buu). As seen in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two-versus-two match between the team of Goku and Tien Shinhan versus Gohan and Piccolo, he's successfully trained this flaw out of Gohan. Even in the lulls in combat, Gohan is completely silent, on-guard, and ready, and when fighting he is absolutely unrelenting. Contrast that with his arrogance when he was at peak power versus both Cell and Buu.</span>

When Brianne de Chateau and co. try to transform into their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> alter-egos, he simply blasts them stupid before they can finish. It takes Brianne, Goku, and Toppo to browbeat him into letting it happen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Crocodile doesn't usually mess around unless he's absolutely sure he can do so and has the time for a minor distraction. When he first fought Luffy, Crocodile gave him a few minutes to attack pointlessly, then promptly kicked his ass. He also avoids carrying the Villain Ball during a battle with some mercenaries; when they drank some water that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">enhance their strength but kill them in a few minutes</a>, Crocodile just flew to the top of a palace and waited for them to keel over.
</li><li> Mr.1/Daz Bones, who ranks just below Crocodile, fits the trope even better. Since he can turn any part of his body into a blade, he wastes little time cutting his opponents to pieces.
</li><li> Hawkeye Mihawk. One of the only two people in the series who doesn't call their attacks and most of his battles end in one strike. He rarely stops to chat, choosing only to speak after his opponent is defeated or too weak to do anything against him. The one time he does get especially chatty was to Zoro during their first encounter, but that's only because the difference in their skill was so obvious that Zoro couldn't so much as hit Mihawk. (That, and Mihawk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">admired Zoro's resolve</a>).
</li><li> Even more so Magellan. He rarely speaks while fighting, and when he comes across <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Blackbeard and his crew invading Impel Down, he attacks them instantly instead of questioning their motives.</span>
</li><li> There's also Vergo, who's just as no-nonsense as Magellan. Despite his quirks with forgetting things, he plays no games when it comes to fighting or taking care of his business. He goes straight for the kill every time with no smiling, laughing, or even evil-gloating at all. He also cruelly punishes those who don't show him respect. Vergo also does not wait for his opponents to finish calling out their attacks or performing gestures to use their powers, deliberately interrupting them mid-sentence or mid-gesture with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>.
</li><li> Akainu is also a great example. Since he lacks Aokiji's empathy and Kizaru's laziness, he will do everything in his power to kill pirates and will only chat with them if it means manipulating them into fighting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> in his favor or doing a task for him.
</li><li> Fujitora has also shown himself to have these qualities. Like Akainu, he doesn't mess around and will pull out all the stops right off the bat to finish his fights as quickly as possible. Unlike Akainu, he tries to limit casualties as much as possible and goes out of his way to make sure that any collateral damage is either repaired or fairly compensated.
</li><li> Charolette Katakuri is definitely this. Unlike the majority of his brothers and sisters who tend to be more relaxed when not fighting, Katakuri is <em>always</em> in a dead-serious mode. Whenever he's fighting any opponent, he always goes for the kill, nothing more. He even told his older brother to kill off the Vinsmokes when the latter kept gloating at them. Katakuri is also one of few opponents who doesn't underestimate Luffy from the start as he already knows Luffy is a formidable opponent.

They're supposed to get in, engage the enemy, and get out again. Individual Quincies vary in how well they meet this objective, and Yhwach has killed off at least some of his elites for screwing up. Yhwach doesn't explain his abilities until after they're already in effect. He's been able to use a doppelganger to masquerade as him to uncover Yamamoto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Bankai</a>, and Yamamoto had no idea until it was far too late. Ichibei also thought he was defeating Yhwach until Yhwach had fully understood Ichibei's powers and destroyed him. The best Quincies at following Yhwach's strategy appear to be Lille and Pernida. Lille takes his sniper abilities very seriously and is happy to pick off Shinigami from a distance to "cull the herd" while Pernida doesn't explain his abilities at all, leaving his opponents to try and muddle through what's happening; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mayuri</a> struggles to understand Pernida's ability.

Being the one initially tasked with collecting the Class Cards, she's not happy with someone else in the Mage Association taking her off the role and giving it to Rin and Luvia in a blatant power play, so she waits until all the cards have been collected, and then marches into Luvia's mansion unannounced and demands that she hand them over or she'll take them by force (and being an absurdly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Bare-Fisted Monk</a> who can go toe-to-toe with Servants, take them by force is exactly what she does, even to the point of being willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">kill Kuro</a> to retrieve the Archer card.) Her actions would ultimately bite her in the ass, though, as it turns out that Rin and Luvia had found the location of an undiscovered eight Class Card, which meant that her trying to kill them without stopping and listening to them jeopardized her original mission, as they were the only ones who even knew it existed. She also completely destroys Luvia's mansion in the process, causing an angry Mage Association to saddle her with the repair bill, driving her broke and homeless.
</li><li> Wrath from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is most definitely this. Unlike his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">superior</a>, Father, or the other homunculi, when in battle, he won't yammer on about his own species' superiority, hint to their villainous plan, or needlessly torture his opponents. If he sees you as a threat, he will make sure to dispose of you as quickly as possible, or at least incapacitate you, so you're easier to use for Father's plan, like threatening to kill your childhood friend if you resign from the military. Justified in that, unlike the rest of the villains, he doesn't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">Resurrective Immortality</a> to give him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">free time to blather on</a>.

Another one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Tsuchiryuu</a>: when facing the Ogame and Nakaizumi school members at the main gate, he first goes for the mook archers, killing them all in melee, and then takes on Gensai and fully takes advantage of his dead angle to try to kill him.

</li><li> Once the inevitable war with the Federation begins, the combined power of the Federation, Klingon, and Romulan empires only blunts an offensive led by hard-as-nails clone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> in advanced warships. It gets so bad that the Federation actually loses control of the titular Space Station! It takes an entirely literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> to stop the reinforcements that would have steamrolled the allied forces.
<ul><li> Sisko turns out to be this for the Dominion. Sisko brings the warship he designed to fight the Borg out of mothballs, foresees the Dominion attack &amp; creates the minefield that effectively saves the Federation from total defeat, and the moment he takes back the advantage in the war, he presses on to claim total victory.
</li><li> Section 31 believed it was acting this way when it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> used Odo to infect the founders with a genetically engineered virus that would have killed them all.</span> Unfortunately, they didn't account for the Founders' level of spite. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Without the cure developed by the protagonists, the last orders to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Jem Hadar</a> would have been to burn the galaxy to the ground without anyone available who could have called off those orders.</span>
</li><li> The Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order take a similar approach to Section 31. Recognizing the threat of the Dominion, they overcome their differences to put together a joint fleet of warships to attack the Founder's homeworld. Using cloaking technology they are able to glass the planet in minutes. Unfortunately, the Founders were aware of the attack, had in fact expedited it to lure them into a trap, and the Founders make it clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire">the only reason the Cardassians aren't all dead YET</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantKillYouStillNeedYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantKillYouStillNeedYou">is that they need them to win the war.</a>

And if you try to attack him after escaping the Spellhold maze without getting the other inmates to help you, he just kills you — not even in a controllable battle, just a cutscene. The only way the player is able to suss out his master plan at <em>all</em> is because he keeps writing things down in journals for the player to find (though that's justified with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Irenicus suffering from memory loss due to the loss of his soul.</span>)

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>: When Terumi appears in another guise like Hazama, he wants to play with you. When he takes direct control and appears as Terumi, he wants you to hurt, he doesn't care if you survive the ordeal or not, and the only thing removing slightly from his no-nonsense-ness is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadistic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">mania</a>.

He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">No Ontological Inertia</a> and needs the hatred of others to survive — if he draws out your suffering, it's to improve his lifespan.
<ul><li> One example is in <em>Continuum Shift</em> where, having just literally curb-stomped Ragna, he turns and gets back to his current plan of getting Mu-12 to kill the Master Unit. Once Ragna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight">pushes himself up</a> and claims that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem">Just Toying With</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">Terumi</a> to get his attention, Terumi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">goes absolutely apeshit</a>, ripping into Ragna and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">stomping him into the ground</a> while yelling for him to die.
</li><li> Another <em>Continuum Shift</em> example involves the end of Makoto's arcade story. Terumi's plans for Noel involve brutally mindraping her so she would willingly become his Sword of the Godslayer and destroy the Master Unit, but that requires that somebody who knows what she is and is willing to talk her through it stay at least one Hierarchical City's distance away from her. The <em>instant</em> Makoto is done knocking Noel out, he pulls the latter away, spews <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">stealth insults</a> at the former whilst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">cackling maniacally</a>, and tries to kill her; while he goes full-bore with just about everyone else he fights in Arcade mode, Ragna included, here you can tell he isn't trying to hide the fact he wants the squirrel dead yesterday.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when he, in <em>Central Fiction</em>, regains his true form; he even loses the sadistic, maniacal glee he used to have when shredding his opponents in the past and instead replaces that with a cold and brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>; he delivers a swift <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to everyone in the immediate vicinity that could pose a problem to him, kidnaps Mu-12 and immediately sets out to confront Amaterasu directly. Because he was being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell">Stalked by the Bell</a> as a result of injuries sustained in the previous game, he could not afford to fuck around in getting it back lest his unmaking catch up with him, and every method he takes in <em>Central Fiction</em> is explicitly aimed at achieving that goal in as little time as possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While he's <em>far</em> from willing to admit it, part of the reason Makoto pisses him off so much is that she unwittingly set up events that put a parallel Jin Kisaragi into the Susano'o unit, effectively locking him out for much of the story.</span>
</li><li> Kokonoe tends to be this as well, as a heroic grey example. While a number of her plans don't work out for one reason or another, she acts quickly and decisively. <em>Calamity Trigger</em> has her aware that Hakumen is a significant threat to her due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>, so she snares him with a trap that would've removed him for good if not for Rachel's interference. <em>Continuum Shift</em> has her send Lambda to watch Ragna fight Terumi so that Lambda can kill the latter the moment she spots an opening. It fails, but this is due to a third party hijacking Lambda. In <em>Chrono Phantasma</em>, she sets up a trap for Azrael, who's hunting her, and lures him to it instead of trying to give him the fight he wants. Even when she first learns he's after her through an ambush, she fires a rocket launcher at him and immediately retreats. Her arcade ending in <em>CP</em> also has her alter her own brain so she feels no hate for Terumi, making him utterly powerless against her. The only thing she doesn't want to use is her arsenal of nuclear missiles, and that's because she's smart enough to see them as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> largely has a lightness of tone and several hammy super-villain, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Lord Recluse, is the Big Bad for a very good reason. The game's large array of scene-chewing villains, tossing around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>, are all just an opening act. If you make it passed them to the point where he actually needs to tend to issues in-person, he will crush said villain ball beneath his heels. No banter, no mercy, no alternate victory conditions and a mind that can calculate entire battle scenarios in seconds.
</li><li> The Devil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead">Cuphead</a></em>. While all other bosses constantly spout quips and puns at the player after defeating them, the Devil in his final phase doesn't even bother with this, simply declaring "Anyone who opposes me will be destroyed!" while holding the desiccated remains of Cuphead and Mugman's heads in his hands.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Doom Slayer</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal">Doom Eternal</a></em> is a rare heroic example. It's obvious that the Slayer revels in the hurt he inflicts on demons and those who work with them, but he generally is mostly interested in ending them as efficiently as humanly possible. Each of the brutal glory kills last at most a few seconds before he casually tosses the corpse aside. In <em>Eternal</em>, when he comes across the Hell Priests, every time he has them at his mercy and they attempt to gloat or bargain, he kills them in seconds without uttering a single word towards them.
</li><li> Giygas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> wastes no time attacking Earth when the Apple of Enlightenment predicts that he will be destroyed by the Chosen Four. He sends an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a> after Buzz Buzz when the latter tries to get Ness, one of the Chosen Four, started on his journey. Giygas then uses his powers to influence the evil within the hearts of people and animals while also giving life to inanimate objects to attack Ness and his friends. For the whole game, nearly everything is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">trying to kill the Chosen Four</a> or at least hinder them in some way. By the time you do confront Giygas, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his immense power as well as his still lingering guilt and feelings for Maria, his former human foster mother, tears apart his mind and body, leaving him as a blabbering dangerous idiot that can only speak incoherently while attacking the heroes with random psychic powers.</span>

</li><li> One of the best examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series is The Emperor, the antagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>. The game starts with him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicInvaders">summoning the forces of Hell to plague the Earth</a> while, at the same time, his armies conquer basically most of the world. Then, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Resistance</a> proves to be an actual threat, he kidnaps its leader Princess Hilda. When the heroes eventually save her, her father (the King) suddenly becomes fatally ill; it later turns out that they saved a demonic doppelganger instead of the real princess, as the Emperor had anticipated. This move distracted the good guys long enough to complete his Airship, which quickly proceeds to bomb several towns in the game. When the heroes destroy the Airship, they find then find out the Emperor has cast a spell that has lifted his castle into the sky and surrounded it with a <em>magical tornado</em>, and he uses <em>that</em> to destroy every town that the Airship may have missed. The protagonists <em>finally</em> find a way inside the castle and kill the Emperor. But that isn't the end. The Emperor's soul split into two halves: a good and an evil side, and the evil side <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHasNewManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHasNewManagement">goes into hell, TAKES IT OVER</a>, and then comes back to life as the Dark Emperor, who is far more powerful than ever. In heaven, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> characters from the game find that the Light Emperor now possesses the throne of heaven and wants to atone for his actions and asks them to forgive him. Eventually, though, they come to realize that even <em>the "good" side</em> of the Emperor is still pure evil and is just trying to trick and kill them. It takes the <em>combined</em> might of both the living and dead protagonists to destroy both the Light and Dark Emperors at the same time and finally destroy him for good.
</li><li> Golbez in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> is perhaps even better. He spends the first part of the game exploiting Baron's Red Wings airship fleet to gather the first two Crystals, as this makes them the dominant power in the world. For the third Crystal, Fabul has been warned by the party and hunkers down to defend, so he takes matters into his own hands, sweeping into the Crystal Chamber, blasting Cecil and his friends away, and then abducting Rosa when she tries to intervene. When he finds out Cecil is trying to become a Paladin, he sends one of his strongest minions to kill him before he can complete the quest and specifically chooses Scarmiglione for the task because Cecil's dark sword is near-useless against the undead. When that fails he instead manipulates Cecil into getting him the fourth Crystal, offering to release Rosa in exchange; naturally, he pulls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I Lied</a> once Cecil hands the Crystal over to him, blasts him back, and departs again. In the next confrontation, he finally pulls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a> and attempts to kill Cecil and the party, but is defeated and forced to retreat. He spends the rest of the game behind the scenes, waiting for Cecil to get the fourth Dark Crystal to keep it from him, only for him to take control of Kain's mind and snatch it away.

While in the comics the character was just a brainless killing machine, the animated version (as a sort of meta-commentary for how one-dimensional the character was) is a bio-engineered assassin built for the sole purpose of killing Superman. Doomsday knows he's been manipulated since birth to hate Superman but he also doesn't care and embraces that he has no goal or motive beyond killing him.

</li><li> This trope actually shows up a lot, as the show loves to subvert supervillain tropes. Two or three villains were specifically defined by it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>:

Much like Amon and the Equalists, the Red Lotus are dangerously competent villains. As shown in their kidnapping attempt on Korra, they infiltrate Zaofu with no one noticing, incapacitate Korra without raising any alarms, any only fail to get back out because Pabu happened to catch them and alert Bolin. After losing Korra in the subsequent fight, they cut their losses and retreat.

<ul><li> Similarly in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Alternate Future</a> segment in <em>The Cutie Remark</em>, it's shown he wasted <em>no</em> time sticking it to Equestria. As soon as he had completely seized the Crystal Empire he forcibly conscripted the innocent citizens into an army using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveCollar">mind-controlling helmets</a> and went on the attack. It takes everything Equestria has to even hold him at bay, let alone actually put up a fight.
</li><li> And again in the Season 9 premiere when he's brought back from the dead. He heads straight for the Crystal Empire, only briefly slowing down to brainwash himself up an army along the way, storms the palace, kicks Cadance and Shining Armor's asses by taking Flurry Heart hostage, and takes the Crystal Heart for himself. When the Mane Six show up to fight him he <em>immediately</em> goes for his best attacks, and when he realizes he can't stand up to the Elements of Harmony, he fakes his death so he can follow the Six to the source and destroy the elements themselves. With that destroyed, he immediately sets his sights on Ponyville, and then Canterlot, taking them both down in no time at all. When faced with Discord who he realizes he can't beat, the second he figures out Discord likes Fluttershy he aims for her forcing Discord to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">throw himself in the way</a>. Though he does a bit of gloating along the way he remains deadly focused the entire time, and manages to not only conquer two entire kingdoms in a single day but would have also gotten a decisive victory against the Mane Six had they not at the last possible second gotten a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a>.
</li><li> Tirek hams it up a little but generally is cold and goal orientated, taking what he wants and moving on with little interest in gloating or boasting. Unlike many of the other villains he's also quite happy to get physical with his opponents, and overwhelming firepower is his <em>first</em> resort.
</li><li> Similarly, though having to keep up her facade as a loving town leader forces her to give way to a <em>little</em> nonsense, deep down Starlight Glimmer does <em>not</em> dick around in <em>The Cutie Map</em>. Though she tries to get the Mane Six to join her willingly, she is instantly suspicious of them and tasks members of her village into spying on them, and by the time they decided to dig too deeply into how she was removing cutie marks it turns out she had anticipated that, already laid a trap, and effortlessly imprisons them, intent on bombarding them with sleep deprivation and propaganda until they break.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Tempest Shadow</a> from the movie.

When they encounter Jack, they quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">overwhelm him with blitz-style attacks</a> and force him on the defensive for most of the episode. They don't stop to let him catch his breath, they don't banter, gloat, or monologue, they don't need to eat, drink, or rest, they can instantly heal from any injuries, even shrugging off attacks from Jack's sword, Aku's sole weakness. They don't want to fight Jack, they want to <em><strong>kill him</strong></em> and they will do it any way they can. To put it into perspective, they come out of nowhere and sucker punch Jack, punch him in the stomach, gives him a swift and brutal uppercut, and whenever Jack successfully parries one of their blade strikes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">the Minions just punch him in the face instead</a>.
<ul><li> Season 5 gives us the Daughters of Aku, who...are basically the exact same thing, except they're human instead of magic. And female. And in skintight black catsuits—er, bodypaint.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once Jack finally makes it back to his time, he immediately goes to finish off the weakened Aku as quickly as possible, attacking him without pause and giving the latter no time to process what's going on nor any opportunity to escape with his life.
