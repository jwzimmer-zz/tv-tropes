Commonly occurs to heroes who have turned to the dark side, friends of the heroes who have done the same, or the Worthy Adversary. Often tends to occur in military or espionage settings (or characters involved in the same), where codes of loyalty and honor may require an extreme solution if violated. It doesn't have to be a gun — any time when the hero offers a noble suicide to a disgraced foe applies — but the 'pistol with a single round' version is quite common.

</p><p>Another variation occurs in stories involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, wherein the person being left a pistol is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee">Zombie Infectee</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">kills him/herself to prevent returning as a zombie that would menace the other heroes</a>.

See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">Face Death with Dignity</a>.

<ul><li> In the end of the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a></em>, Maeno gets hit by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a> hard, so Rin just hands him a loaded gun and leaves. Although it looks like he kills himself, it is later revealed that he wavered in the last moment, being left with just a light scratch on the forehead. In the end, he stays with Rin for the half of the series.
</li><li> At the end of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>, when <a class="urllink" href="http://whentheycry.wikia.com/wiki/Okonogi">Okonogi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is convinced the battle is lost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">he surrenders</a>. His boss Miyo Takano refuses to surrender. He delivers a venomous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, gives her a gun, and tells her the only option she has left is to take all responsibility for the failure with this trope. She uses the gun to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">one last attempt at revenge</a> against the after-school club of Hinamizawa.
</li><li> Dutch and Revy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> do a variation of this to a Neo-Nazi leader. Subverted in that the man doesn't have the courage to kill himself and tries to shoot them instead (they don't leave the room), only to find that the gun has no bullets. Turns out the bet they were discussing a minute ago was which one of them he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">will try to shoot first</a>, the hulking black man Dutch, or the Chinese-American woman Revy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "It wasn't much of a bet."</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, the cowardly and incompetent British official Sir Penwood chooses to stay at the command center in the midst of the SS Blitzkrieg on London, even though it meant certain death. The man was visibly terrified, but refused to abandon his duty when it could be the single most important thing he'd ever done with his life. Integra Hellsing, impressed by his dedication, slides a pistol across the table to him...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">but it isn't for Penwood to use on himself.</a> The explosive, holy silver bullets were a parting gift for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">use against the vampiric Nazi soldiers</a>.
<ul><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HellsingUltimateAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HellsingUltimateAbridged">Hellsing Ultimate Abridged</a></em> when Integra advises Penwood to save one round for himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Actively and repeatedly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, despite (or perhaps BECAUSE of) Japan's historical affinity for using suicide to regain one's lost honor. On several occasions, Conan goes well out of his way to prevent cornered criminals from committing suicide (including old-school Sepuku in one memorable case), stating that since HE'S the one who solved the case and left them cornered, their deaths would otherwise be on his conscience.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, Avdol sets Polnareff on fire and then gives him a dagger, instructing him to use it so that he can die quick and painlessly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>, because Polnareff's refusal is what gets Avdol to put out the fire, as it indicates that he is honorable enough to feel remorse for his wrongdoings, and thus worth saving.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, Treize Khushrenada breaks with the Romefeller Foundation over their use of "mobile dolls" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Drones</a>). Out of respect for his past service, the Foundation does not have him executed. Instead, they confine him to their headquarters and give him a fancy single-shot pistol. However, Treize refuses to use it and bides his time until he can take power back.
</li><li> A variation occurs in the anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/JuniTaisenZodiacWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/JuniTaisenZodiacWar">Juni Taisen: Zodiac War</a></em>: rather than a gun, Boar leaves her sister a perfectly sharp knife when she's been holed up after she started killing her schoolmates and masnion staff, muttering to herself about killing something.
</li><li> A variation happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. During the Battle of Trost, Armin offers to give Mikasa his remaining gas so she can use her ODM gear to help the others. Since Armin would be stranded in a Titan-infested area, he asks to keep a small blade that's too small to use against a Titan so that he can kill himself rather than be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> by the Titans. Luckily, he never ends up having to use it.

<ul><li> When Erwin Rommel was implicated in the "Valkyrie" plan to assassinate Hitler, he was told that if he were to "die from his injuries" (he'd been injured by an Allied air raid) his family would be protected as the heirs to a war hero.

<ul><li> Preventing this type of reaction is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> pistol is loaded with only one round.
</li></ul></li><li> Colonel Alfred Redl was head of the Secret Service of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the years prior to WWI. He was selling secrets and agents to the Russian Empire (the Russians had him in their clutches by blackmailing him: they knew he was a closeted homosexual). He was finally discovered in 1913 (ironically by his subordinates, who applied the very methods Redl had developed for the Secret Service) and was offered a revolver with a single bullet. He took the offer.
</li><li> A variant of this trope happened during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> in Poland: a captured officer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Home Army</a> was released from prison to deliver an offer of limited cooperation to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> command. However, the command refused to even think of it, instead telling him to "solve the matter in an honorable way". After a couple of days, he shot himself.
</li><li> The case of the Roman general Regulus was even more badass: captured by the Carthaginians and sent back to Rome to negotiate a surrender, he told the Senate to fight to the end rather than give in to the hated enemy, even though it meant that all the prisoners would be tortured to death. He then went back to Carthage to die alongside his men.
</li><li> During the Estonian first independence 1918-1939 the legitimate way of carrying the death penalty was to first to offer the convict "a cup of legally approved swift-effecting and painless poison". If the convict refused from it, he was to be executed by a firing squad. The poison option was abolished during the Soviet regime 1939-1991. Death penalty was abolished in Estonia in 1995.
</li><li> This is pretty much standardized in the medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarEast">Far East</a> when the elite were implicated in capital offenses less than treason. The reason was, like all examples, to protect the person's honor. It is often effected by an Imperial "gift" of things that can be used this way (sword, long pieces of silk, or poison). While nobody mentioned what are those gifts used for, the giftee can usually get the idea.
</li><li> A non-lethal variation often occurs in workplaces where a sympathetic supervisor might discover that a liked employee has nonetheless done something worthy of termination and presents them a resignation form instead of reporting it or before an investigation occurs. In some situations it's simply done so that the person can honestly say that they left voluntarily, and were not fired. <br/><br/>This variant is especially common in politics. So common that in some countries it's virtually unheard of for a member of government to actually be fired. In fact, the usual ostensible reason for such a resignation-in-disgrace — "to spend more time with my family" — is so broadly recognized that it's a common euphemism for the practice.
</li><li> Before confessing to killing her two sons, Susan Smith asked the sheriff to give her his gun so that she could take her own life.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webley_Revolver">Mess Webley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">British Army</a> refers to a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Mess_Webley">metaphorical or actual pistol handed to officers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when they really screw up or turn traitor and need to do the decent thing rather than suffer the ignominy of resigning their commission and leaving the mess. Though actual honorable suicides are practically non-existent nowadays (and it is arguable whether or not they ever actually took place), the "Mess Webley" now refers more generally to the last resort of actually taking responsibility for a fuckup when there are no feasible means of disguising it or passing the buck (or, more rarely, if the buck can only be passed to those the clumsy officer regards with affection). If the usage of the Mess Webley will make a mess (either literally or in terms of fallout), the unfortunate is requested to "spread some newspaper down" to avoid such mess, which would, depending, be either blood and brains or punishments for other officers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">Pirates</a> would strand people (usually mutinied captains) on deserted islands and give them a flintlock with a single bullet to save them the pain of dying from hunger or exposure if they didn't get rescued before it was clear they were done for.

</li><li> A political variant, in the climax of the Watergate scandal. On the night of August 7, 1974 (two days after the release of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal#.22Smoking_Gun.22_tape">"smoking gun" tape<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), a group of Republican Congressman met with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>, informing him that his support in Congress had evaporated, the House was certain to approve articles of impeachment, and no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for his acquittal. Nixon subsequently announced his resignation the next day.
</li><li> Aleksandr Krymov, a leader in the Kornilov Plot against the Russian Provisional Government shot himself in the heart after the Plots failure. He left a note to Kerensky, the Provisional Prime Minister, explaining his actions. He was an honorable military leader who believed in honesty, and if he stayed alive he would have to lie to keep himself out of jail. He also felt that Russia was doomed to destruction without a strong central government that could crush leftist agitation and carry on the War resolutely.
</li><li> An American paratrooper during the Battle of the Bulge witnessed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">merciful</a> version of this trope this first hand: Following a skirmish with a German squad, a great majority of the enemy soldiers surrendered, most of them wounded and freezing in the cold weather. However, the American squad did not have the supplies, nor the manpower, to guard or feed the prisoners (like the Americans, the Germans were badly low on supplies and food, and one of the reasons they surrendered was to get aid for their wounded.) Finally, the American squad leader grabbed a German machine pistol, gathered just enough ammo for it, and disposed of the rest of the weapons and ammo, telling the German squad leader (who spoke English) the cold hard truth that they could not take them prisoner, and that he was leaving the submachine gun behind for those who wanted to end it quickly. A few minutes after the Americans left, they began hearing single gunshots behind them.
