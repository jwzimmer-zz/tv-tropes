Beyond that, you've never flown and you've never had to control the immense speed and strength that you have now. Or heart. But, don't you worry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">Powers are programs</a>, and so it follows that you are also programmed with the instruction manual on how to use them.

</p><p>This is <em>especially</em> true of characters whose main ability is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copy other characters' skills</a>. Whether or not they initially have trouble figuring out their own powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">they are almost universally capable of instantly figuring out how to use their stolen powers</a>, typically to the same level of skill or effectiveness (or even a greater level!) as the character who had the power first. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Shapeshifters</a> (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">animal-based shapeshifters</a>, or with otherwise non-humanoid forms) get bonus points for intuitively being able to transform into various objects <em>and</em> intuitively control limbs and other moving parts that weren't there previously.

At times, they'll remain blissfully unaware that they have powers, accidentally shooting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">laser beams out of their eyes</a> when staring too hard or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">ripping doors off hinges</a> when opening them too abruptly. The opposite end of the spectrum is severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>, where the character can't figure out how to turn off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a> or stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">sending people flying with each exhale</a>. Rarely will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">extensive training</a> be needed to fix this; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> is enough. Give the new hero a day and he'll be ready to put his newfound powers to use. At most, a mentor will have to stop by to tell the new hero the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull">activation phrase</a> or show the hero how it's done a few times.
</p><p>Often times, this is coupled with a time limit to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">the greatest x in the world</a>. In these cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> is sometimes used, but the character still emerges an expert — one of the greatest people to ever learn the craft — after only a month or so of work. Especially jarring when it's used to explain away gaining a skill most people take a lifetime to perfect. There's rarely even any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waving</a> to explain this away, the audience is just supposed to believe that the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">are that damn good.</a>

In video games in particular, it would be far too resource-intensive and time-consuming to fully animate different levels of proficiency at different character levels. Characters in RPG games, for instance, often learn their new weapon skill or super attack the instant they hit Level 43, and not a moment before. However, there will usually still be a semblance of progression - weak fireball at Level 10, medium fireball at Level 21, huge fireball at Level 45 -, thus still leaving a sense of improving the skill even if each stage comes in its own instant update. Evidently, skill is a quantum effect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QuantumPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QuantumPhysics">like particle energy</a>.

Also, despite being absent often in the novel, he has the highest grades in the class, somehow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em>, it supposedly takes years for the wolves to master a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack">Battouga</a>. This doesn't prevent the dogs from learning them by just seeing them used in battle (usually against themselves) and then using them just as effectively. Taken to extremes by Gin, who learns <em>three</em> of these moves this way, one from a battle <em>he only watched from the sidelines</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku and most of the other protagonists to a lesser extent. Muten-Roshi took almost a century to master the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kamehamehadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kamehamehadoken">Kamehameha</a> wave; Goku picks it up by seeing Roshi do it once. Similarly Goku picks up Tenshinhan's Solar Flare technique simply because Tenshinhan used it twice on him. However, it's averted with learning how to fly, which requires a timeskip.
</li><li> Tenshinhan explicitly has the ability to pick up and master other people's techniques by studying them briefly, while Buu can master any technique known by someone whom he's absorbed as well as the former's study.
</li><li> Taken to extremes with Goten and Trunks, who somehow master the Super Saiyan transformation before they even hit puberty, whereas their fathers spent months or years training in deep space under extreme conditions to learn it. Even more than that, they skipped several requirements of achieving the transformation, such as experiencing a moment of pure rage. Handwaved later with the explanation that hybrids are able to access the transformations more readily at the cost of lower overall enhancement from said transformation and the now-confirmed fan theory also states that if someone has already achieved Super Saiyan on their own, any children they might have after that point will have a much easier time accessing it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> with Captain Ginyu, who is extremely weak after performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> with Goku, whose greatest fighting potential (at the time) requires the use of the Kaioken technique, which Ginyu does not know. He does begin to get the hang of Goku's body, but just how far it would have gone is unknown.
</li><li> Vegeta seems to instantly learn to sense people by their ki energy (as opposed to needing a scouter to detect them) while being temporarily blinded during his fight with Goku. Since this isn't even something that can be "observed" at all, apparently he instantly learned to do it simply by being told it was possible. By contrast, it took Goku several months of complicated training to develop the same ability.
</li><li> Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a>, Goku's bother and DBZ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a> Raditz was retroactively given this ability in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballHeroes">Dragon Ball Heroes</a></em>. Strangely enough, despite acquiring the Super Saiyan form through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a> their father Bardock has not exhibited this ability to date.

Although he won a junior MS competition, they use mini mobile suits for that, so it doesn't explain how he can pilot an experimental, full-sized combat model without any training. Of course the fact he's a Newtype helps, but then again Amuro, who is also a Newtype, had no idea what to do when he first climbed in a MS even with psychic powers.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em>: hand-carried mobile suit equipment have <em>device drivers</em> (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre">makes sense</a>).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The back stories</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> tell that Union <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Graham Aker</a> is also this: When he was test-piloting the Union Flag (then in its initial testing stages), he managed to make it transform at high speeds (normally something that should only be done while stationary due to intense G and aerodynamic forces inducing stress on the fuselage), after having read the instructions <em>once</em>. Thus, the maneuver itself garnered the nickname "Graham Special" thanks to him.

<ul><li> Zig-zagged with the eponymous character, who despite being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">idiot</a> with little natural talent, is able to pick up highly advanced techniques in a very short time through a cloning technique. By creating a thousand or so clones of himself, he trains a thousand times faster. Even with that, most of his moves aren't perfected, he just gets better at working around the drawbacks caused by imperfection.
</li><li> That cloning technique is itself an advanced technique, and almost no one is able to use it on the same scale that Naruto does. He learned at the age of 12 by reading a scroll for a couple of hours. So much for not having natural talent.
</li><li> One perfect example of this at work was when he first <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">used the Kyuubi's purified chakra</span>. He immediately sensed a hidden enemy, chased him down when he fled, and managed to land a devastating blow, all faster than could be perceived by trained shinobi. The only problem is he broke his leg in the process because he's not used to the power.
</li><li> Another perfect example? Well we have one genius in his twenties. He graduated the ninja academy before he was 10. He's incredibly strong, fast as sound, and throughout part I, is regarded as THE fastest character in the series. On the other hand, we have a 12-year-old brat who barely graduated the ninja academy after three straight failures. He is terrible at concentration, is known as a village prankster, and for a time was considered the "Dead last" of his team. So, the 24-year-old genius invents an awesome jutsu. The problem is, it takes him three-and-a-half years to fully create it. Years later, the 12-year-old idiot hears of the technique, and learns it in a week.
</li><li> Sasuke, and anyone else with the Sharingan, has instant learning of new techniques as a basic ability. An example of this in work is when he developed the Mangekyo Sharingan. In a single battle he managed to seamlessly combine its offensive and defensive ability into a single ability. Unfortunately for Sasuke, his overconfidence in his abilities nearly got him killed, and his overuse of them nearly left him blind.

<ul><li> Ichigo goes from rank novice to one of the strongest fighters in the story, able to go toe-to-toe with shinigami captains and take out lieutenants without even using his sword, after two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> sessions which collectively comprise about twelve days. He can take on any training to master any ability within a fraction of the time it takes normal Shinigami to learn anything. Even if it takes centuries to master something, Ichigo rarely needs more than a month.
</li><li> When the Stern Ritter steal Bankai, the Quincies are able to master the stolen Bankai well enough to defeat the Shinigami they stole them off. It leads to As Nodt defeating Byakuya in one of the most brutal, gory attacks in the story's history.
</li><li> It took both Yoruichi and Soifon years to master Shunkou. However, Yoruichi only recently taught Yūshirō Shunkou, so she's startled to see he's mastered it so quickly.

</li><li> Multiple examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>:
<ul><li> Whenever Shirou uses Projection to replicate a weapon, he will instantly gain all experience of battles the weapon itself has gone through, allowing him to wield it (or, depending on interpretation, for it to wield itself with his body following its lead) with ease as if he were a complete master.
</li><li> Projection itself. Not only is he an instant expert literally better than anyone at it in the <em>entire world,</em> he's even doing it in a form that should be <em>more</em> difficult. And he learns enough to project a perfect Noble Phantasm in less than two weeks. His projection is so good that some of it actually breaks the rules of magic and doesn't disappear, which is apparently almost one of the True Magics. Naturally, he's unconsciously cheating like crazy to do it but...
</li><li> The Saber and Rider classes have the passive Riding skill, which allows the user to ride any mount or vehicle (with limitations in the cases of some exotic or unique mounts—say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider">dragons</a>) with perfect mastery. This works even if they know literally nothing about a vehicle. Saber once mentions that she could fly a plane; she just needs to get on the saddle and take the reins.
</li><li> A more literal and weaponized example comes from the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>. The servant Berserker, the Black Knight, whose ability, Knight of Owner, can turn <em>anything even remotely usable as a weapon</em> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Noble Phantasm</a> and use them to their fullest extent, even better than Shirou and his Projection magic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This ability brings to mind one of the tales with the figure he's based on (Sir Lancelot) winning a duel armed with only a twig of wood.</span> Combined with his "Eternal Arms Mastery" (which allows him to keep all of his prodigious fighting skills even when under the effects of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">Mad Enhancement</a>) he turns out to be a nearly unstoppable combatant who only loses due to a sudden loss of mana supply — <em>and all this in spite of being insane the whole time</em>. Among other things, Berserker is shown picking up and kicking ass with a street lamp, the mythical weapons of other legendary heroes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">an F-15 fighter jet</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">the gun from that same jet.</a></em>

The only sword he struggles to master is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">Tenseiga</a> because mastering it requires compassion rather than sword skill. This is especially noticable when Tenseiga gains the Meidou Zangetsuha technique.

Kalifa in particular, while they should have had barely enough time to grasp the basics of their powers (Giraffe-transformation and strength sapping soap bubbles respectively), is shown to be quite proficient when she faces Sanji and Nami. Kaku flounders a bit more, though, coming up with ideas and attacks on the spot in the course of his fight with Zoro.
</li><li> Averted otherwise, where Devil Fruit users often have at least some difficulty figuring out what their powers are, and often take a great deal of time figuring out how to use them to full effect. After over ten years for Luffy and over twenty for Robin, the both of them are still learning new ways to utilize their abilities. In Luffy's case, it took him a while to even manage to throw a punch properly after eating his Devil Fruit.

He instantly understands how a given weapon works and how to use it, and also gains a considerable boost in speed, endurance, and strength when using a weapon. There is just one condition that must be met: the weapon must have been created for combat. For example, a sword that was created as a decoration won't trigger Saito's powers. Also it can be any weapon, from a simple sword to a fighter plane or artillery cannon.
</li><li> Sheffield gained this as her power of a Myozunitonirun familiar. She can understand how to use any magical artifact and almost any spell.

Clare tries to learn the Quicksword skill and after several days is told she is mentally incapable of ever mastering it. But her teacher has nothing left to live for and cuts off her own arm so Clare can use it. In the final chapters, it is also shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teresa of the Faint Smile can easily replicate other warriors' combat techniques simply by observing them in action, even if it took their creators years to perfect them.</span>

Hanamichi Sakuragi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">The Fool</a> and <em>does</em> have enormous potential, but not only does he have no idea of how to use it, his sempai and teammates treat him like the rookie he is and he's stuck for a <em>long</em> time learning the basics.

Kurapika's designed some of his powers to work strictly on Genei Ryodan and no one else, on pain of his own death.

He also learned instant movement after two separate training sessions. Not even training from hell. It <em>is</em> explicitly noted that his specialty is really rapid learning and improvising rather than extreme power, however. Another example is Asuna instantly grasping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">kanka</a> technique while Takamichi had to work <em>seriously</em> hard at it.

Also, she gave Takamichi tips on how to do it.</span>
<ul><li> Kurt Godel is another example in his backstory. As a teen he wanted to learn Shinmeiryu swordsmanship, but Eishin refused to teach him, so he simply learned the techniques by watching Eishin perform them at which point Eishin gave up and took Godel on as his student.

In contrast, Deku has an unusually strong affinity for One For All's esoteric aspect and is the first person to be able to unlock its secret powers. Still Deku is yet to master them.</span>
</li><li> Averted in All For One's case. He can steal any Quirk he wants (except One For All), but cannot instantly master it. Which is why he prefers to steal strong and/or easy to use Quirks, especially strength enhancing Quirks, making him an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>.

<ul><li> The main character Ryoma Echizen is shown to be easily copying and mastering techniques such as the snake, Rising Shot, Zero-Shiki Drop Shot, etc., while constantly employing new techniques such as the single-footed split step. However, it's explained that this is because he was trained at a very young age by his father, not because of any natural talent.
</li><li> Played straight in the Prince of Billiards episode, where Ryoma somehow managed to not only copy everyone else's techniques, but also beat the resident billiards genius. All despite never having played billiards before and committing two fouls in his first two hits.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted to an extent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>. Maka, Black Star and their Weapons <em>are</em> shown to take some time to get used to new powers/techniques, although in the meantime they do make do with a less refined version. Shadow Star didn't last very long to begin with and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">dangerous</a>, and Demon Hunter served its purpose when it first turned up, but Maka only really put it into practice in the fight with Arachne. And between the two she's shown talking with Ox about possibilities for her new technique, which is a nice touch. Demon Hunter's predecessor, Witch Hunter, turns up with less fuss than it did initially.

And don't forget that, the entire time he was doing all this learning, his training had to compete for his time with nocturnal crime-fighting, running a major corporation, cooking the books so that anyone receiving a Wayne Enterprises stock report wouldn't immediately know his secret identity, designing tons of cool, but distinctively branded, toys, jumping through hoops to purchase such toys in ways that wouldn't immediately give away the identity of the purchaser of the world's entire supply of Batarangs, and all of this while maintaining enough of a carefree social life to maintain his cover identity.

He technically starts his training with Obi-Wan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> and begins getting a feel for his powers, but thanks to Obi-Wan's sacrifice against Vader he leaves off on that for the remainder of the film. Three years later by the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, Luke's Force skills have improved somewhat, but he still needs <em>a lot</em> more training (struggling to pull off a Force pull for one thing) and goes to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Yoda</a>, with the majority of said training occurring over the unspecified period of time it takes the Millennium Falcon to reach Bespin sans hyperdrive.

Although real Jedi apparently started training in early childhood, Luke is able to put up a good fight against Vader (although he's holding back somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">thanks to coming to a revelation about his relationship with Luke</a>) and use powers such as Force jump by the time he leaves the planet. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, Luke, who's otherwise spent most of his time over the one-year timeskip looking for Han rather than training, is now a full-blown Jedi, being able to employ mind tricks and numerous other Jedi powers with little effort.

</li><li> Rey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> is able to manage the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">Jedi Mind Trick</a>, do a Force pull, and wield a lightsaber in short order with no training whatsoever. She performs the mind trick within minutes of discovering she has the ability to use the Force. In fact, she's able to repeatedly clash with and overpower Kylo Ren (who's had much more training than her and is aiming to kill her) in direct combat. The later film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em> provides a suggestion as to how she is able to master all of this so quickly: she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the granddaughter of the Sith Lord Palpatine, one of the most powerful Force users in the Galaxy</span>.

He was built up as a quick study at linguistics and warfare, and before being captured by a Samurai group he was already intensely studying their ways. However, in the course of one winter (three months) that he stays with them, he picks up enough Japanese to carry a conversation. He also becomes proficient with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">katana</a> in the same time period, but he was already shown to be a badass fighter with various other weapons. The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example, though, is that he is given a <em>full set of samurai armor</em>, which he has <em>never</em> trained with, mere <em>hours</em> before the final climactic battle, and is instantly proficient in fighting with it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push">Push</a></em>, Nick has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telekinesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telekinesis">telekinetic</a> all his life, but sucks as the film opens because he never practices. It doesn't really take him very long to become quite adept at it, and he starts kicking ass once he confronts Carter and Victor. Slightly subverted in that Victor is still shown to be a better Mover, as he is able to effortlessly defeat several dozen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs">Triad</a> members with automatic weapons by throwing up a telekinetic shield and then defeating each enemy in turn by "moving" them.

And highlighted at the end of <em>HSM2</em> where Troy is told to learn a new song, literally two minutes before going on and after goggling for a moment tells Ryan "I can't learn a new song." Of course, when he goes on stage two minutes later, he's not only learned a new song but learned how to harmonise with his absent partner.

She does this by speed-reading the 23rd century equivalent of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>. Even before that, after falling into Korben's cab, she figures out how to say "please help" (albeit making "please" sound like "ple-is") by reading the various signs in the cab. Someone without prior language knowledge shouldn't be able to figure out how written words sound.

Everett Ross is already a pilot, and although he has no knowledge of the advanced Wakandan aircrafts, when he remotely takes control of the Royal Talon Flyer, Shuri has configured the interface "American-style" for him, meaning the controls are similar to those of a fighter jet Ross would be already familiar with. He only needs coaching for a gesture-activated function that you wouldn't find on an ordinary jet, but otherwise has no problem shooting down the transports by himself.

It's even pointed out before they first get in the pods that Norm has logged hundreds of hours in the simulator, while Jake has only read the manual. Not to mention the fact that Jake hasn't been able to walk for months (subjective time, since he spent years in cryo).

Clark spends 30 years learning how to control his abilities and has a significant advantage over the Kryptonian soldiers who only seem to have access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>. Played straight by Zod who, after what seems like no more than a few days of practice on Earth, discovers his full power-set. Additionally, from what we can see of Clark, it is highly unlikely that he's ever so much as thrown a punch before his first fight with Zod's minions. Nevertheless, on his very first outing, he fights like, well, <em>Superman</em>. It's noted that he's not as good in a fistfight as Zod's minions, but he's still able to hold his own against multiple trained super-powered warriors at close quarters.

It's most blatant when the town needs a translator, and he learns a significant portion of the Portuguese language in <em>twenty minutes</em>.

She also learns how to perfectly control her mental shield within days despite basically everyone else with a power taking <em>years</em> to perfect their powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eragon goes from never having used a sword before to being skilled enough to hold his own after a month of practice. He similarly goes from totally illiterate to being able to read to a basic level in a month. He also manages to write a fourteen-page epic poem about his experiences up to the point where he's getting trained by the elves <em>in an hour and a half</em>. This is a language that a few months ago he only knew a couple of words of (although since then he had been learning every day while <em>living among people who speak it as their main language</em>, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as far as that effect goes for learning real languages).
</li><li> Eragon learning magic, considering that we are told that most Riders are years into their training before they are even <em>told</em> that they can do magic, although it is both acknowledged as exceptional in-universe, while also not being unheard of, just rare, since the normal method for training magic users involves forcing them to attempt physically impossible tasks, causing them to eventually unconsciously use magic to perform it. It's also notable that doing so leaves him <em>unable to walk</em> from exhaustion after the first time, and once the instinctual moment has passed, he was unable to so much as levitate a pebble until he learned to use it consciously, this being far closer to how magic users are generally trained.
</li><li> The Ancient Language itself is an interesting case. On the one hand, it does seem that Eragon learns it awfully fast. On the other hand, it is a magical language. In the third book, a Muggle who doesn't know the language and by all rights should hear nothing more than gibberish, complains that the words ring in his ears longer than they should. And understands his true name when it is spoken to his face. The magical nature of the Ancient Language might cause the words to stick in a person's mind easier.
</li><li> The most obvious example of this trope would be when Eragon breaks his right arm, forcing him to learn to use a sword with his left. Normally, this is extraordinarily difficult; try writing for a long time or perform some other complex task with only your non-preferred hand. You probably aren't even holding the object correctly, as all your actions must now be mirrored from what you normally do, which works against the natural habits of your brain. Learning to sword-fight with your 'wrong' hand *can* be done, but your non-preferred hand will never be as strong as your preferred, which is why most swordsman never bothered. Not only does Eragon learn to use his left hand to swordfight in a few weeks, but he is also apparently totally equal to Murtagh, who has been learning to use a blade his entire life and fights Eragon with his preferred hand.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha">Memoirs of a Geisha</a></em> revolves around this trope, deconstructing it at one point: The protagonist explains that, due to a wager made between her legal guardian and her teacher, she wasn't given much time to actually practice certain skills. Instead, she would visualize them constantly, study when her mind was most pliable and invented a plethora of mnemonic devices to help her because there was absolutely no other way for her to achieve her goals and change her situation. She explains that while it <em>looked</em> to others like she was mastering her skills without ever practicing, in truth her mind was working on little else.
</li><li> Lord Hong of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em> regularly masters in a matter of weeks disciplines that require other human beings a lifetime of study. Everyone else's problem is that they just don't <em>focus</em>.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VernorVinge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VernorVinge">Vernor Vinge</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowsEnd">Rainbows End</a></em>, where JITT (Just-in-Time Training) allows anyone to become an Instant Expert in anything, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the added complication of "JITT-stick", which essentially turns the character into a semi-permanent idiot savant in the area they received JITT in. JITT-stick plays a significant role in the novel's conclusion.</span>
</li><li> Kellhus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse">Second Apocalypse</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius">Impossible Genius</a> who is raised as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> by monks who train from birth to be "self moving souls." He can become fluent in a language in days and begins improving upon mathematical formulae almost immediately after learning them.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> book, the protagonist learns the "dance with death" using the eponymous blade. The sword apparently stores all the sword fighting skills of anyone who's ever wielded it, and Richard is able to download the knowledge into himself, to the point where he can slaughter garrisons of trained soldiers even without the magic blade.
</li><li> Becoming an instant expert in more or less anything that takes their fancy is one of the advantages of the transhuman Luculenti in John Meaney's <em>To Hold Infinity</em>. Many taught themselves to paint or dance at the level of the masters of those arts on Earth... as <em>hobbies</em>, taking them perhaps a month or two of practice alongside their normal day jobs.
</li><li> Another science fiction story invoking this trope is <em>Galactic Odyssey</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer">Keith Laumer</a>, in which the protagonist is put to work sorting indistinguishable glorm-bulbs... which turns out to give him the ability to learn essentially anything with a single run-through.
</li><li> The wielders of the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series can all pretty much do it instantly, even though they're mostly aged about twelve and may not ever have picked up a sword before. It's heavily implied that they're the reincarnations of the Sword's first bearer, Martin, and the skills carry over between lifetimes.
</li><li> Peter F Hamilton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightsDawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightsDawnTrilogy">The Night's Dawn Trilogy</a></em> thrives on this. Everyone with neural nanonics can partake of 'Didactic Learning', which basically embeds any knowledge they might need. They might not be quite as good as someone who's been doing it for years, but they can certainly operate complex objects or understand the local phlebotinum competently. It has basically abolished school. If only we had this tech.
</li><li> Subverted in the Isaac Asimov short story <em>Profession</em>. Nearly everyone, on reaching their majority, gets an instant education implanted into their brains for the occupation that they are best suited for, based on aptitude testing. There is a downside to this, though: people who receive their education this way become incapable of much in the way of original thought. Only a selected few, with the aptitude to learn the hard, old-fashioned way, are capable of developing new technologies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em>: The series takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtUpInTheRapture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtUpInTheRapture">after all the 'good' Christians have been taken from the earth</a>, and follows a group of people who converted to Christianity after witnessing this explicit miracle. And who talk, think and behave like those 'good' Christians instantly after their conversion. Justified in the case of Bruce, who was a pastor before all this and just lacked proper faith. Not at all justified in case of Buck, who can quote Bible passages, uses unusual lingo, and starts considering holding hands with his new girlfriend to be taboo after knowing each other for just a few weeks.
</li><li> In <em>Semper Fi</em>, the first novel in W.E.B. Griffin's The Corps series, Malcolm "Pick" Pickering's flight instructor nearly brings him up on charges after his orientation flight, as Pick is so comfortable in the cockpit (and is able to easily fly and land the aircraft) that it implies that he lied when he wrote "none" in the previous flight experience box on his application.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom">Old Kingdom</a></em> books, Sabriel's father, the previous Abhorsen, only let her read one page of <em>The Book of the Dead</em> at a time, ever, spaced out over careful intervals to prevent her from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">going mad from the information</a>, because that book contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">Things Man Was Not Meant to Know</a>. Along comes Lirael some years later. She polishes off the entire <em>Book of the Dead</em> in <em>one night</em>. And when she officially takes up the mantle of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abhorsen</span>, she's instantly proficient at it (though, granted, she's had some years of practice fighting Free Magic nasties). This is justified because the Book is all but directly stated to be sentient and unlike <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sabriel, Lirael needed to become Abhorsen <em>right now</em> in order to prevent the complete destruction of reality.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em>, this is explicitly one of Luke Skywalker's abilities, extrapolating out from the movies. After all, he was able to deflect blaster bolts he couldn't even see within minutes of practicing with a lightsaber for the first time. Combined with the authorial tendency to give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a>, he can be a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero">Showy Invincible Hero</a>. Though if you are rebuilding the Jedi Order after having had no more than a few months' training, it doesn't hurt to be a quick study.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Outcast</a></em> when Luke goes to learn a technique from the Baran Do Sages, one allowing him to produce and control a low-level electromagnetic charge in his own body. Since he's the highly experienced exiled Grand Master of the Jedi Order, not a sage-in-training, he's put through the accelerated course, without ritual or training artifacts. All the same, it takes thirty seconds for him to produce a charge - since he knows a vaguely similar technique - and his teacher dryly says, "Well, that's about eight weeks of apprentice training bypassed." Now he has to learn to control it, which is the tricky part. Luke then asks how long it took his nephew to learn to control his charge and was told three days. Luke smiles.
<div class="indent"> "It's very un-Jedi-like of me, but I want to break his record."

</li><li> In <em>High Wizardry</em>, the third book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dairine has the entirety of magical knowledge downloaded into her mind, which, combined with the massive amount of raw power she has, allows her to single-handedly fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lone Power</a> to a standstill.

</li><li> Unlike the film version, the literary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a> often averts the trope. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em>, M has to tell Bond how to properly wear a jeweller's glass.

Si is able to get the hang of it after a few weeks of training, which is impressive enough...but both Kate and Julia are able to master it <em>immediately</em> with absolutely no training at all just from Si describing it to them, making the project look pretty clumsy in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a></em> tracks Kvothe's upbringing as he learns a wide variety of skills, from music to magic to swordsmanship. As a prodigy with amazing talent for virtually everything, Kvothe learns skills far faster than normal people, quickly gaining the ability to perform magical, physical and intellectual feats far beyond his age and experience. However, this is all balanced by the fact that, in the short scope of the story, he doesn't have time to reach the heights of most actual experts in these fields, who have studied them for decades and have no small portion of talent themselves.

While their years of work as con men allows them to realistically act the part, they lack the knowledge and skill of sailors. Despite weeks of intensive training, they are only able to learn the very basics. As soon as they are in a situation without their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick">Hyper-Competent Sidekick</a> to cover for them, it is immediately apparent to everyone that they have no idea what they're doing.

<ul><li> Sylar's main power is the ability to "understand how things work," which goes towards explaining how he's able to rapidly master all his stolen abilities. And even he has to take a few days to iron out the kinks in particularly cumbersome abilities, such as superhearing (high pitched noises become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>) or shapeshifting (involuntary shapeshifting due to major psychological issues).
</li><li> Charlie (and Sylar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">through power theft</a>) can not only remember everything she read but could also properly apply it as well.
</li><li> In Season 2 there's also Monica who is able to instantly learn how to do any physical skill or martial arts maneuver she's physically capable of simply by watching anyone else do it once, either live or via recorded media.
</li><li> Initially subverted with power sponge Peter Petrelli, who has to be near someone to use their power and has no control over the power, as shown when he meets Claude and automatically becomes invisible. After some training, he is able to control them, but when he gets too many he has trouble suppressing all of them and goes off like a nuke. After that, though, he never has any issues again and can immediately use any power he gains.
</li><li> Ted Sprauge has no control over his nuclear-based powers for most of the first season and constantly emits radiation (which kills his wife via cancer) or explodes when under stress. While Sylar is instantly able to control his power near perfectly, Peter is not so skilled and nearly blows up New York
</li></ul></li><li> The 1980s show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero">The Greatest American Hero</a></em> is a funny aversion to this trope. The main character receives a super-powered suit as a gift from aliens -then immediately loses the manual, so he must resort to trial and error to learn what powers he has and how to use them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lana Lang learned kung fu in three days. She also learned how to successfully run her own coffee shop instantly and while still in high school. The big issue with her was that she kept knowing how to do things someone in her situation <em>would not know</em> in order to keep her plot-relevant. The coffee shop was to explain why she kept getting involved in things-the whole school hung out there, Clark included. The kung-fu and so-called "military training" were because the writers had finally listened to all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel">Distressed Damsel</a> complaints about her character. The second she needed to know something, it was known so they could say she was still relevant.
</li><li> In "Leech," Jonathan points out to Clark (who has recently been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>) that it took him 12 years to learn how to use his powers properly. In the same episode, the guy who gained Clark's powers masters them in the space of about a day.

<ul><li> Subverted when Malcolm has to learn to duel with swords overnight. In the actual duel, he seems to be doing well at first, but his opponent is only playing with him. He does win the duel, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">combat pragmatism</a> rather than fencing skill.
</li><li> River is implied to be one of these. Aside from being a gifted savant, she also possesses literal mind-reading powers, enabling her to pull complex knowledge from other people's minds, and it is implied that she had this ability even before she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes">ended up in the Academy.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Xander kept his military knowledge for a couple of years after the Halloween incident where everyone became their costume. By season 4, two years after the initial incident, his soldier memories were pretty much gone.
</li><li> One of the powers of the Slayer is knowing how to use a weapon just by picking it. They still have to train to master it, though.
</li><li> Averted in "Earshot". Buffy gains telepathy by coming in contact with a demon and suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>. She doesn't just overcome it and learn to control it; instead, she's unable to stop it at all and suffers intense mental trauma from hearing dozens and dozens of thoughts all going on at once. She only gets better when her friends manage to cure the condition completely, meaning that she never learns how to control her newfound, shortly-lived telepathy power.
</li><li> Lampshaded when Buffy was teaching Dawn about slaying; Dawn says that the vampire they were using for training shouldn't know all the kung-fu that most of them do since he was only recently turned.
</li></ul></li><li> The ability of imprinting technology to make Actives experts in any given field at the press of a button is a series premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>. However, it's not possible for a Doll to possess more than one set of skills at a time without being wiped and reloaded... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Echo starts retaining imprints and they load her with every combat-based imprint they have</span>.
</li><li> This trope is pretty much what makes the title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY">Kyle XY</a></em> so special.
</li><li> The whole shtick of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em>: with a little learning time, Pretenders such as Jarod could master any role from janitor to astronaut.
</li><li> A standard of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> series, where the characters generally are barely old enough to have a driver's license, yet can handle a giant robot without so much as a training montage. The progenitor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> series, meanwhile, tend to vary- sometimes the team has been trained beforehand in the use of their weaponry, other times they have to learn (either via training, or instructions delivered either verbally or via a display).
<ul><li> The very first episode has Trini and Billy lampshade the fact they can pilot the Dinozords. It seems their powers provide the knowledge as well as fighting skills. Played with in that the heroes don't retain these skills when they change back: Billy still has to train with Jason and Zack to build his martial arts skills.
</li><li> Downplayed a little the first time Tommy appears as the White Ranger. He has a little trouble piloting the White Tigerzord, mostly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">Saba</a> is something of a back seat driver.
</li><li> Also lampshaded a little in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> / <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger">Gekisou Sentai Carranger</a></em> where Tommy/Kyousuke has to break out <em>a manual</em> (mid-battle) to figure out a function of his Zord. (Note to beginning drivers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>.)
</li><li> Averted with Ziggy the Green Ranger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> (it only took them 17 seasons) who doesn't get an instant martial arts download into his brain, and the other rangers were hand-picked martial artists. Though he can pilot his Zord better than he can a car, he still needs to get to grips with it.
</li><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>. Waving your arms and yelling "Galactabeasts, over here!!" is <em>not</em> how you summon your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">living mecha animal thing</a>.
</li><li> Also, a bit of a subversion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em> / <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger">Mirai Sentai Timeranger</a></em> since their in-helmet visors show them what to do when operating their Megazords for the first time as well as some new weapons. Eric/Naoto even has a nice AI to instruct him on his new tech. And since the others were Time Force/Timeranger operatives and Eric/Naoto was a trained security force officer, the rest probably came naturally. Wes/Tatsuya, on the other hand, had some difficulty at first, though he got the hang of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue</a></em> / <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV">Kyukyu Sentai GoGoV</a></em> the heads-up display also tells them of their new tech and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> tells them how to operate things as well. It was the first <em>PR</em> series (though not the first <em>Sentai</em>) to have tech-tech instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek">Magitek</a> and so such things were often turned on their heads.
</li><li> Played totally straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>, in which the Rangers master complex skills (including actual <em>flight</em>) within the space of a single fight going on elsewhere. A particularly egregious example, since the goal of the main characters is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">To Be a Master</a> and thus a lot of the series focuses on hard work and training.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>; though it was stated that all of them were of varying skill levels, they were still trained to be samurai and rangers. Which makes sense, since in this series the ranger identities are hereditary, having been passed down from parent to child — Jayden (Red Samurai Ranger) in particular has been trained practically since <em>birth</em> to be the absolute best samurai he can possibly be.
</li><li> In the two recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebration</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a> shows (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em>), the protagonists have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copy the forms and abilities</a> of their precursors. Apparently knowledge comes with this as well; when the Gokaigers transform into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoseiSentaiDairanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoseiSentaiDairanger">Dairangers</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Gekirangers</a>, for example, they bust out the super-powered Kung Fu for which those two teams are known.
<ul><li> It seems that Ranger Keyes contain not only powers but their skills too, considering that Basco can use them to summon Sentai members to fight for him.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition, nearly every main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> gets a couple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">upgrades</a> throughout the course of his show, and rather than take time to figure out how these new weapons and abilities function, will instead launch into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to show off just how powerful his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">new toys</a> are.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnDoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnDoe">John Doe</a></em> is a perfect example of this - he can look up any piece of information at any time, making him an expert in every field. This is consistently shown as he flies a helicopter with no training, is a capable doctor, makes significant profits in the stock market, and pulls off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver-esque</a> stunts. One episode has him lose his "walking encyclopedia" ability. With it, he loses all the skills he picked up from that, including such things as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingStick">Driving Stick</a>. He ends up losing most of his fortune due to a bad investment since his broker is so used to doing everything John tells him instead of making the calls himself. Presumably, he makes it back the moment his ability returns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>:
<ul><li> Not content at being the World's Greatest Diagnostic Physician, an accomplished musician and speaker of several languages, House recently was advised to get a hobby to help manage his pain without Vicodin. He accompanies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">Wilson</a> to his cooking class, and by the end of the episode is told he has created "the best thing I have ever eaten."
</li><li> After House fires him from the diagnostic team, Chase goes on to work in the OR. Not only does he quickly become a surgeon within a couple of months, but he's also suddenly Plainfield's <strong>best</strong> surgeon, and House's go-to both off the team and after rejoining it. Another fellow, Taub, was hired in part because he was a trained (cosmetic) surgeon, so this displacement causes him some angst, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorJerk">House</a> loses no opportunity to play on.
</li></ul></li><li> Between seasons nine and ten of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, Ray Langston went to CSI school in a big way, and instantly caught up to (and possibly surpassed) the regular crew on suspiciously specific scientific knowledge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>: Resident ding-bat Charlie apparently learns to play the keyboard with almost no practice, saying, "Keyboards just make sense to me."
</li><li> As the carrier of the latest version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase">Intersect</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> can do about anything that a World Class Spy can do, and then some.
</li><li> It's never drawn attention to but Dharma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DharmaAndGreg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DharmaAndGreg">Dharma &amp; Greg</a></em> is repeatedly shown to master complex skills in a matter of hours. All of them are forgotten by the end of the episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, season 5, "The Prodigal," Michael and his hybrids are immediately able to use the Atlantis computer systems with ability similar to experts like McKay or Zelenka. When Michael was on Atlantis, he was never given the opportunity to learn how to use their computers, nor were any of his hybrids exposed to Atlantis' computers. It is not credible that they would be able to use the Atlantis computers to lock everyone out or to set a destruct, or even use them at all without some prior training in human and Atlantean computers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, "Prometheus Unbound" the enemy character, Vala Mal Doran, not only is able to take over the ship, which is not possible the way she did it, but she instantly knows how to use the Prometheus' computers and is able to lock Jackson out and to run the ship. This is not possible, as it's the enemy's first exposure to human technology. She wouldn't even be able to read English using the Latin alphabet, never having been exposed to it before.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, "In a Mirror Darkly", has four individuals who become instant experts on running a Starfleet vessel, the U.S.S. Defiant, 100 years more advanced than they are used to. They are able to get it up and running and into combat within ten minutes. This would be like naval officers in 1912 trying to run a 2012 nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. They might be able to navigate the carrier, but they would have no clue of what most of the systems on the carrier would be. Fission didn't exist back in 1912, nor did the electronics, nor did the weapons systems. It would take a week just to crack open the manuals and find out what the major systems did. Starting up the reactors and running them would be impossible without a knowledgeable crew. Learning the basics of arming and firing the weapons would take days. Ironically, Archer and company could easily do it if the timeline was anything like the original one that Roddenberry wanted (the 1980 book Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology is based on that timeline) as the technology of the Defiant would about roughly 20 years more advanced than what they were used to. The Baton Rouge Class of the STSC of 20 or so years before the Constitution Class is roughly the equivalent of the NX Enterprise (except it had shields but no phasers) but it would not be that much of a stretch for a Baton Rouge crew to start up and operate a Constitution Class like the U.S.S. Defiant in the manner shown in those few minutes
</li><li> Played for laughs (and to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillBailey">Bill Bailey</a> a chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowOff">show off</a>) in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em>. Manny sits down at a piano, idly taps a couple of notes, then instantly joins in with the music playing on the radio, much to his own surprise.
</li><li> Mycroft pretends he learned Serbian in two hours in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>. In fact, what he does is use his previous knowledge of some Slavic languages and figure out the key differences. Enough to be able to say a few phrases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Rory is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">quasi-resurrected through a Nestene duplicate</span> as a Roman soldier in the first century, he mentions that he just woke up one day in Rome, his head full of "Roman stuff." He spends the episode fitting in with the Romans without any difficulty at all and displays the same weapons training that they do.
</li><li> Clara gains super hacking powers instantly courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> shenanigans in <em>The Bells of Saint John</em>.

This is quite a feat, considering that she had never seen a live horse, or indeed a live <em>animal</em> until a few hours before. Averted, however, with the other characters, who are shown to actually need to learn how to ride.
</li><li> One of the side effects of eating brains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em> is the zombie temporarily gaining the deceased individual's skills. In the pilot, Liv learns to speak fluent Romanian. In the second episode, she becomes an artist. In later episodes, she becomes a martial artist, a master hacker/MMORPG player, and a sniper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a></em>:

<ul><li> Oliver Queen, even in the island flashbacks, was able to perform a complicated counterattack with just 10 days of training. In the third season, he was able to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a> in a sword duel despite only being trained for three weeks while Ra's is a centuries-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> who even curb-stomped Oliver earlier in the series.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> can represent this kind of thing in various ways, reflecting its generic nature. Obviously, these dont tend to be available to realistic human characters.
<ul><li> For example, the advantage <em>Wild Talent</em> means that, a few times per game, you can try absolutely any skill at better than default (a medieval ascetic can try to program a superscience computer from ten thousand years in the future). For a few points extra this event provides enough experience to justify buying the skill with spare character points.
</li><li> Theres also a set of advantages that provide a pool of character points that can be reassigned as required to different skills and other character features. One notable use for these is in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em> setting, where artificial intelligences (who can be playable characters) can be designed with interfaces allowing them to be given access to useful skills in the form of software. However, in this case, the benefits are somewhat downplayed, in that plug-in skill use is penalised in high-stress situations such as combat, because the plug-in skill isnt bedded in like a real skill.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mind Mages are the <em>kings</em> of this trope (especially the <em>powerful</em> Mind mages, apprentices still exhibit this trope but to a lesser extent). They can, at any time, instantaneously learn any human skill, talent or knowledge. A Mind mage can become the master of kung fu, a virtuoso, a genius computer hacker or compete with a Nobel prize winner in his own field within seconds. Coupled with their ability to instantaneously alter their innate intellectual and social capabilities (becoming more intelligent, more charismatic, etc.) and there's virtually no non-athletic human achievement they can't duplicate(and even if they can't be the absolute and utter pinnacle of physical achievement, often they can still be scarily good). If they combine that with Life magic - which allows for the raising of physical attributes - then there's virtually no mundane feat that they can't duplicate.
</li><li> Time Mages do them one better by temporarily rewriting their history so that they not only always knew how to operate widgets at a world-class level, but they grew up suited to the task (base stats changed to optimum) and have all the associated credentials, i.e. a Ph.D. in widget operations and three Nobel prizes in widgetology, granting them access to and knowledge of all of the resources that a world-class widgeteer would normally possess. For the extra cheap-shot, life and mind can add more stats on top of this as above.
</li><li> It can even be argued that this is the core theme of Mage in general. The name of their casting stat is gnosis, which is an old word for divinely granted knowledge (as opposed to learned or a priori knowledge), aka the medieval word for this trope. Their magic isn't power so much as instant understanding of how things really work and where to nudge for maximum effect.
<ul><li> First-level abilities generally reflect this: Matter - instantly understand how to operate a machine, Mind - instantly know how to interpret expressions, Fate - instantly understand how things fit together, Death - instantly understand how things decay and wear down. Etc.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, training in favoured or caste abilities takes no time. Spend the XP, and presto - instant competence.
<ul><li> Many Exalted (especially Solars) can also learn Charms that allow them to instruct others in record time.
</li><li> One notorious goof in the first edition Autochthonian book's widely hated Locust War chapter had the Autochthonian invasion force become masters of ship-to-ship combat who neatly pwned the Realm Navy, despite it being only a few months since the first time they encountered a military fleet (there are oceans of oil in Autochthonia, but there are no navies).
</li></ul></li><li> Since its creation, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has allowed characters to instantly gain new skills, languages and even entire classes at level up. A period of training is implied to be needed to gain these abilities, but it never was clearly stated in the rules, making it commonly ignored unless the GM enforces it.
<ul><li> The Warblade class has this as a natural feature, called Weapon Aptitude. Essentially, it allows them to transfer their feats that are meant to work with one weapon to work with another by practicing with that weapon for an hour. (Essentially, it's meant so that if you spend your feats in greatsword focus and then find a really cool magic spear, you can use the spear without having wasted half your build.) This can even apply to things like Exotic Weapon Proficiency, meaning a Warblade can become an expert with a weapon that they couldn't even wield without taking penalties an hour ago.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has a clearer example. A character who raises their intelligence may gain new skills. Pathfinder, unlike some editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, makes all bonuses for high scores retroactive, including skill points gained for a high intelligence. This means if a very powerful character raises their intelligence and gains skill points, they could dump them all into one skill and become one of the best in the world instantly.

They can even use pledges to give other people those skills, and if the other person is a normal human, they can achieve even greater levels of expertise, up to a rating of five on a five-point scale; supernaturals can only gain ratings up to three.

The sourcebook <em>Brainwaves</em>, which was only released unofficially after the line had already been cancelled, would have added the "Fast Learner" enhancement, which would have allowed the Mega-Intelligent to learn new skills faster (i.e., with less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint">Experience Point</a> expenditure) than other people.

<ul><li> Link displays this to the degree that fans argue that it might be a side-effect of the Triforce of Courage. No matter how odd a new item is, he instantly acquires the knowledge of how to use them when he picks them up, despite the fact that he usually starts the games living a fairly normal life. It's more believable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, where he had Epona for a while and had a mentor teaching him a thing or two.

However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> due to Link gaining some of Darmani's memories upon transforming into him, as demonstrated when he gains the ability to read Goron script despite having never seen it before.

<ul><li> Picking complicated locks and hacking military-grade computer software like a professional security expert.
</li><li> Performing complicated surgical procedures that should take years to learn for a medical degree.
</li><li> Becoming an expert in negotiation, to the point where you can persuade almost anyone to do anything, and be such a master salesman that you can convince people to buy sand in the desert.
</li><li> Learning to be as stealthy as an actual ninja, hiding in plain sight where you should easily be seen and being able to kill people in one blow with your bare hands if necessary.
</li><li> Most importantly, being able to <em>not only</em> proficiently use any firearm you encounter, from a simple hunting rifle to a plasma gun, laser minigun, gauss rifle, or almost any weapon you can imagine, but you also intimately understand how they work and how to cannibalize other weapons to keep them working in absolute perfect order.
</li><li> At least the game explains it with the perks you take. Daddy's Boy/Girl lets you gain a certain amount of Skill Points into Medicine and Science, since your dad was a doctor in the vault. Some of course the way that the player character can equip any weapon and use it differs how ever. Then again the Pip-Boy tells you the name/type of the weapon, so you guess that how you know how to work it.

You could be gaining new skills in an absurdly short amount of time or remembering things that you already knew how to do before Benny shot you in the head before the start of the game.

</li><li> This is part of the plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main character (Desmond Miles) is put in a machine called the Animus to relive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">genetic memories</a> of his assassin ancestor, Ezio, in the hopes that he'll gain Ezio's skills in a few days rather than years. The Animus and the Bleeding Effect allow him to pick up on lifetimes' worth of skills in a few days or weeks, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">at the cost</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">deteriorating mental state</a> that is already causing hallucinations and may eventually leave Desmond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">entirely unable to differentiate himself from his ancestors</a>. The strain (and the emotional trauma of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing a friend</span>) eventually cause him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to fall into a coma</span>.
</li><li> With Ezio himself it is used straight. The various kinds of weapon-fighting <em>might</em> have been taught to him in the past, and the training under Paola and Mario is given the flavour of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> - made explicit in semi-novelisation <em>Renaissance</em> - but he takes to the Hidden Blade incredibly fast with no apparent reason for it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> (and its spinoffs). Mario doesn't apparently even need to train to suddenly learn new abilities once per game, master new power-ups and items per game, and be good at every single sport he's tried in some way. In the RPG games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em>, he can literally get a new item or ability one minute and have apparently completed mastered it the next.
<ul><li> Double subverted with the Bros. Attacks in Superstar Saga in that the powered up Advanced versions can only be learned after using the original a bunch of times (and a cutscene when they are unlocked where Mario thinks of the technique), but both the original and the Advanced are instantly mastered (provided you know the button combos) upon unlocking them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>. Despite just having copied a creature's ability, he's able to use it instantly without problems (unless certain abilities are problems themselves... we're looking at you, Sleep Kirby). Plus, at least by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">anime</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a>, Kirby is only an infant (which isn't farfetched, seeing him in-game).
<ul><li> This even extends to things that aren't abilities. For example, Kirby seems to be a tech whiz, capable of expertly piloting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> as soon as he gets into it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Even though a battle-hardened American Riflesquad can crew a German Pak-38 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PossessionImpliesMastery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PossessionImpliesMastery">know exactly how to use it</a>, any combat experience they have as Riflemen is lost and must be regained as an AT Crew.
</li><li> The American Veterancy System. For example, a Riflesquad takes about 18 kills to gain Vet 3 (the highest). A Vet 3 Riflesquad can outfight an Elite Stormtrooper squad fairly easily. So that's 3 kills per person, and suddenly they're more skilled than Germany's best. Even more so as veterancy is not diluted by replacements, so five green-as-grass recruits can outshoot those stormtroopers as long as they have a veteran to give them some pointers on the way back to the front line.
</li></ul></li><li> In all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> games the protagonist can learn how to use any weapon or vehicle from the moment they see it. The most ridiculous example is CJ from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>, who can load and fire any weapon from an M1911 to a SA-7 Grail rocket missile launcher simply by picking it up and goes through a few (videotaped) lessons to learn to fly any aircraft. The height of ridiculousness is "Vertical Bird", where he sneaks aboard an amphibious assault ship, eliminates about a dozen trained soldiers with either stealth or firepower, and hijacks a Harrier jumpjet to shoot down two other fighters and destroy several boats. Quite impressive for a two-bit gang member from the ghetto. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.</a>
</li><li> Travis Touchdown from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em>, who won a beam katana in an online auction and entered the assassination scene, becoming part of the country's top 11 with little training in between.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Downplayed throughout the series in that you can generally equip any type of weapon or armor as soon as you find it, however, if you don't have the skills (and later, perks) to use it properly, you'll find it difficult to actually hit/damage enemies with said weapons and you'll receive far less protection from said armor. The way to become better with them is to actually <em>use</em> them. (This also applies to spells.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> plays it straight by offering unlimited Training per level. As long as you have the gold to pay for the training, it is possible to be trained from a complete novice to matching your trainer's level of expertise in only a few in-game days. (Each training session takes two in-game hours. If you find a Master trainer who can train your skill to the max, you can go from the minimum skill level of 5 to 100 in 190 in-game hours.) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> and <em>Skyrim</em> would limit training to 5 sessions per level (with 10 skill level increases still required to level up), taking it back to being downplayed for the series.
</li><li> As best seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, anyone willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of training can learn to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality warping</a> language of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragons</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic">Thu'um</a>. What makes those who are Dragonborn (like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>) special is that they have an instinctive knowledge of the Thu'um and can learn its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">shouts</a> very easily. (Mechanically, in-game, this means reading the word of power and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsmine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsmine">absorbing dragon souls</a>.) This is because the Dragonborn are mortals born with the immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Aedric</a> soul of a Dragon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a>: Cataclysm</em>:
<ul><li> Pointedly averted. Whenever a new technology is researched, it's not applied instantly to all units but small craft have to be recalled into a hangar for refit and capital ships have to go offline for a short while as the crew installs the new equipment.
</li><li> It gets even better with the Beast who can only acquire some technologies by capturing an enemy ship in possession of said tech; once the unit is captured, it must be brought into a hangar and disassembled before the tech is even available for research. What makes it an aversion? The Beast is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">technoorganic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated">subversion</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">entity</a> that otherwise plays this trope straight by growing upgrades in the field and presumably sharing instructions among their selves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline">Dynasty Warriors Online</a></em> has each weapon contain the move-set of a character. The trope comes into play that one can copy that weapon's moveset from the original holder the moment they touch it, so they could go from welding a spike ball as big as them to knock enemies 50 feet in the air to using a fan with such grace they glide through enemies. While they do have practice it's very optional, but it is fun to do so you might not avoid it altogether. The only real change his first charge attack in the combo and the 6th, but those vary from individual weapon to individual weapon, so two flutes might have a slightly different combo.
</li><li> Both played straight and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestarGalacticaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestarGalacticaOnline">Battlestar Galactica Online</a></em>. On the one hand, once you pass a certain level you can immediately upgrade to a new starship type without having to go for special training. You also don't need special training to switch between ship models. On the other, the skills that you can train in-game to improve your performance take a clear amount of time to complete, which gets increasingly long as you go up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, learning a new skill, or upgrading it, or learning a recipe or formula from a trainer is easy; pay him the fee, and he casts a quick spell that teaches your player. Also, you can learn a new recipe or plan from a scroll in a few seconds, assuming you have the right skill.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series, it doesn't matter if you're an elite STARS agent, a university student, or a subway station employee, you <em>will</em> know how to expertly and safely use the handgun, assault rifle, flamethrower, or experimental prototype mine launcher the second you pick it up. The remake of the original subverts it a bit with Jill not being as skilled with firearms as Chris: When she picks up a new weapon she's not <em>quite</em> the expert with it that Chris would be, with slightly worse aim or slower firing and reload time.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a></em> you find out that Neo's instant expert training scene from the movie, to him, isn't quite instant as it's a series of virtual training levels.

When her powers manifest, she does the sort of thing that takes a master fifty years to learn <em>by accident</em>, in her <em>judo class</em>. In the ninja fight, she watches the leader do a really complicated chi technique that is supposed to allow a paralyzing strike, then blocks it and does it back to him, perfectly, the first time. Oh, and she paraphrases his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">attack name</a> (Coiling Viper Fang Strike) as "Something something strike!" Despite all this, she still needs to keep working on basics — so in a sense, she has to learn <em>backwards</em>.
</li><li> Solange demonstrates the ability to do this with any skill someone else knows by using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> and general superhuman Exemplar ability to copy someone's skills, letting her be as expert as they are at anything.

</li><li> Sahar's primary ability, aside from her ability to implant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a> of Doom into someone's mind, is the ability to learn another psychic's signature knacks just by getting close to them - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">close</a>.

It comes up specifically with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a>, in that while a Mimic can usually figure out how to use familiar powers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, ones which require additional skills (such as knowing spells which they can case when copying the Wizard trait) or need them to also copy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> (which for some Mimics has to be done intentionally), can lead to serious problems. For example, when Counterpoint copied Chaka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Manipulation</a>, he didn't know to copy the additional ability she had for controlling it, nor did he know that he'd need to avoid being overloaded with one type of energy, and he nearly died as a result.

This means he can learn to expertly throw a knife given five tries but will have forgotten how by the next day.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, this <em>is</em> Uber's power, the ability to instantly be good at anything. This also applies to parahumans in general insofar as basic application of their power goes; when you get your powers you can and do instinctively use them perfectly well. Training and practice are important not for learning how to fireball, but learning how to make sure that you don't accidentally fireball your friends or figuring out tactical applications for fireballing in unusual ways that aren't easily countered.

<ul><li> Katara acquires a Waterbending scroll and teaches herself from it, and in three weeks is able to hold her own against the recognized greatest Waterbender of the North Pole, though she still loses the moment he actually bothers to fight seriously. It helps that Waterbending is a martial art that relies heavily on creative use of its element, which one wouldn't need formal training to get a knack for. She also performs expert-level healing after a comparatively short training period. After a few days of training with an actual teacher he declares her a Master in her own right.
</li><li> Sokka learns to use the sword in a matter of days. Not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> would be able to give normal people any passable sword skills in that manner of time — and Sokka seems to spend just as much time doing calligraphy and feng shui as actual sword practice during said days. It should be noted that Sokka didn't become a master swordsman and had experience with other weapons and used some weapons similar to a sword, becoming a good fighter even before he had an actual teacher.
</li><li> Aang, much to Katara's jealousy, masters moves from a waterbending scroll she picked up.

It should also be noted that Aang picked it up faster because Katara was teaching him what she had to learn by experimentation, something Aang himself notes. Also, while Aang could use them with great skill, Aang did not actually master the bending arts with the exception of air until after the main story takes place

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frequently averted in the show, which features a set of talismans that grant any of a variety of magical powers. Even the good guys don't always use them to their full potential (though of course they do so most often), especially if someone gets them to drop their talisman.
</li><li> Occasionally subverted for comic relief. An excellent example is the super-speed talisman, which has been defeated at least twice by dodging to the side, leaving the overconfident user to smash face-first into a wall.
</li><li> Jade once tattooed herself with an image off of one of Uncle's books. Turns out this is the visage of Tarakudo, the Oni-king of the Shadowkhans, which granted her the ability to summon them. She quickly learns how to command them effectively...which resulted in her being corrupted into a megalomaniac. This happens again later where she accidentally gets half of an Oni Mask stuck to her face and is just as proficient in summoning them as before (All others usually required Tarakudo to provide some guidance), along with being exactly as vulnerable to being corrupted <em>again</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted by Korra. While she can bend multiple elements years long before she's supposed to be able to, it still takes her fourteen years of intense training to master three of them. That amounts to a little over four and a half years per element (assuming that she spent all that time learning, which, since she was stuck in the White Lotus compound, is likely). Once the series starts and she begins her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">airbending training</a>, her progress is slow due to Air not being suited to her non-spiritual personality and confrontational attitude.
</li><li> Averted once again with Asami and mecha-tanks but played completely straight with General Iroh and airplanes.
</li><li> Zaheer, one of the villains of Book 3, Change, manages to airbend like a master despite only being able to do so for all of two weeks after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEmpoweringEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEmpoweringEvent">Harmonic Convergence</a> (though it's partly due to his knowledge of the culture, and partly due to picking up firebending forms from his girlfriend P'Li). This backfires on him when he tries to infiltrate as a new airbending recruit and he inadvertently displays how good he is, which arouses suspicion. It is deconstructed when he fights Tenzin, a real airbending master, who easily beats him. Tenzins sister Kya gives him the second-best fight of the season because she grew up around him and their dad and is one of the very few people on earth who can say shes been around airbending a lot.
</li><li> Jinora is a natural at Airbending, as she was able to pick up astroprojection and other spiritual techniques at the age of 10 when her father, Tenzin, had been at it for all of his life (which even by the end of the series he never succeeds at). Naturally, Jinora is later recognized as a full master at the age of 10, surpassing even Aang (who was an avatar) as the youngest known master.
</li><li> Korra picks up metalbending pretty quickly in Book 3, but she still has a ways to go in that regard.
</li><li> Also subverted with Bolin, when he learns <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> lavabending.</span> He's capable enough at it to protect himself, but in a one on one fight against the other practitioner of the art, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ghazan</span>, who's been using it for far more than a few days, he could barely keep up and needed Mako to help turn the tide.

The main character, Coop, is (usually) an expert at piloting his enormous mecha, Megas.

</li><li> There's also Twilight Sparkle. While attempts to <em>learn</em> spells tend to be hit or miss, she's been shown to perfectly duplicate anything she's witnessed directly. Examples include being able to teleport properly after seeing Nightmare Moon do it once, and learning dark magic simply from watching Celestia do so during a presentation. In the latter instance, at least, it took considerably more effort on her part than the princess needed.

Unfortunately, when a wealthy art collector comes by and likes Spongebob's art, leading Squidward to try to talk Spongebob into helping him out, Spongebob has already taken Squidward's teachings to heart and become just as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist">Terrible Artist</a>.

<ul><li> There is a concept called "The Natural Athlete," where the knowledge, skill, and physical ability of an individual allows them to succeed at nearly any sport whether or not they have spent time training for the needs of the game. Just having a natural gift for hand-eye coordination is invaluable in shooting a basketball, being a fast runner with quick feet is useful in football, etc.

Those with experience in other martial arts may quickly pick up a new style, due to having a fundamental understanding of positioning, leverage, and the general way in which the body moves. However, they're also quite likely to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a> moments when learning new techniques, reverting to older training until the new moves are successfully mastered.
</li></ul></li><li> Some savants have been known to become instant experts in certain fields, including one who learned a language in <em>seven days</em>. However, outside of their particular field, most savants learn like any other person, and some, if they also have intellectual delays, have a lot of trouble learning anything else.
