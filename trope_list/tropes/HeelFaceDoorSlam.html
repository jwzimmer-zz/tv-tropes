This will almost always be the response given to a villain who expresses a desire to redeem themselves, but whose past actions were too far beyond the pale for anything even resembling a convincing redemption to take place. And even if they got the chance to redeem themselves, fearing the redeemed would turn their blades, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">immediately dispatched</a> by the heroes.

</li><li> One daimon in S called Utomodachi didn't even get the chance to remove a Pure Heart from her victim. Rather than do that or fight the Senshi, she ran off crying.

</li><li> Likewise, another daimon U-Ndokai refused to hurt Hotaru and noticed she had collapsed after grabbing a Pure Heart from athlete Shun. U-Ndokai advises her to go to a doctor. Bad luck for U-Ndokai that Hotaru is secretly both Mistress 9 and Sailor Saturn; she sends a wave of energy at the daimon, which allows Sailor Moon to hit her with Rainbow Moon Heartache.

</li><li> At a meta level, he was one of two anime-only characters introduced so the first half of the first arc wouldn't just be Youko freaking out; he'd long outlived his narrative usefulness once the series starting trying to adhere to the books more.

Faced with an impending disaster, he tried to put his costume back on and save the city, only to a) meet with public scorn and b) be caught in the explosion of a fusion reactor. Wait, we're not done: due to his powers, the explosion didn't kill him (actually, due to his powers the explosion shouldn't even have touched him; oh well); instead it left him a mangled, screaming, <em>burning</em> wreck. He then spent the next <em>year and a half</em> on life-support, in agonizing pain and reliving his worst memories, until finally he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">shot</a> by his lover/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler">handler</a> (who then killed herself).

Some months after that fiasco, she broke out of Ravencroft Asylum and kidnapped Malcolm McBride (formerly Carrion, who was human at the moment, the virus inside him in remission) and stress caused by the ordeal caused him to become Carrion again. After seeing Carrion show some sympathy for his mother, Shriek had a brief moment of sanity, and actually tried to absorb the Carrion Virus into herself, trying to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save Malcolm. She <em>did</em> save Malcolm, but the virus didn't kill her... And for poor Shriek, this heroic act only made it worse for her. It drove her deeper into madness, making her think the virus inside her was an unborn child, and she spent her time in her cell eagerly anticipating the birth of her "baby" like an expectant mother. Eventually, the Jackal assaulted her to get the virus back, and when next seen, she was back with Carnage and worse than ever.

Nevertheless, he retired with her to the South Seas. But many other crime bosses he had bequeathed his empire to didn't like having to run it without him, and felt that Vanessa was the cause, so sometime later, she was apparently killed by an assassin's bullet. (She got better later.) The Kingpin returned worse than ever, not only seizing back full control of his former organization, but making sure the police ended up with incriminating evidence that led to the arrest of the ones responsible for his wife's apparent death (he hadn't been fooled for a minute) a true case of a plan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>.

The samurai begins to feel bad about this dishonest life, however, and tells the bookie he's quitting.

This decision to elevate Gollum from antagonist to outright villain was challenged by the writers, so the scene was replaced with another climactic episode in which Frodo spares Gollum and Gollum almost repents, but Frodo then admits the purpose of the quest to Gollum, at which he snaps and attacks Frodo again.

Saruman responds by berating him and then strikes him across the face. Wormtongue is so upset by this that he stabs Saruman in the back and is shot down by Legolas, resulting in yet another point against diplomacy in Middle Earth.

After being called out by his own girlfriend about his actions, David is on the cusp of sincerely apologising to Shaun for all he's done... when an army of zombies break through the window behind him, drag him out, tear him to pieces and eat him before he can actually say it. Ouch. There <em>was</em> an alternate version of the scene where he's killed just <em>after</em> he apologizes, but the creators decided it would be more shocking if he never got the chance.

<ul><li> First up is a lieutenant. The movie seems to make rather a big deal about him reacting with horror and distress at Colonel Tavington shooting Benjamin Martin's son Thomas and killing the wounded Militiamen. There is even a shot of him reacting to the sight of one of the younger boys crying before departing. But then the movie just kills him off in the very next scene.
</li><li> Next we have Captain Wilkins, a Loyalist officer who joins the Green Dragoons and whose zeal leads him to boast that traitors to the crown deserve to die. However then Tavington tells him to burn a bunch of townsfolk in a church, he protests this as being dishonorable and murderous. Nevertheless Wilkins readily caves when Tavington bullies him into it, essentially shutting the door on his <em>own</em> redemption himself. Despite this, there still seems to be some hope for him, given how visibly upset he is watching the church burn, however nothing is ever done with him and apart from a few snarky comments aimed at Tavington, he more or less vanishes from the movie entirely in the final battle (the novelization gives him a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a> moment, where he passes up the chance to shoot Martin as he and Tavington fight to the death).

<ul><li> The Introduction DVD expands on this. Hernandez speaks in it, telling a story about how he had to make a difficult decision between letting a man beat his crack addicted wife, or jailing the man and leaving the obviously unsuitable for children wife with their kids, establishing himself as a cop with morals. The other two cops scoff at that being a difficult decision, telling him that they're gonna be making difficult decisions on a regular basis. Later on, they force him to personally shoot a cop who had evidence proving that Tenpenny and Pulaski were crooked, so he can "be a fucking man." It makes Hernandez's death all the more tragic, as he was pretty much one of the handful of good cops in the whole series.

He pretends to be a superhero called the Gator Samaritan in one episode, and the heroic acts he performs are staged to sell issues of <em>The Daily Rat</em>. But after he rescues Thea Stilton from drowning, he realizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">Good Feels Good</a> and starts disobeying Sally and performing genuinely heroic acts independently of her paper-selling scam. Although Thea is grateful enough to him that she lets him go after he's outed as a phony, and he is clearly feeling morally conflicted over his continued involvement with Sally, the episode closes with him still under her thumb (complete with a humiliating joke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">at his expense</a>), and, the next time he appears, he's back to his old sniveling, weaselly self.

After years in the service of Aku all the other robots of his series have been destroyed, but he has survived <em>because</em> of his emotions. However, when he meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Lulu</a> he finally hangs up his assassin hat for good, determined to settle down and spend his time playing music.

</li><li> The closest Mr. Burns ever came to turning over a new leaf was in "Rosebud". After trying every underhanded way he could think of to force Homer to give him his teddy bear Bobo (and finally hitting rock-bottom by trying to take it from Maggie by force and failing) he gave up; at which point Maggie <em>gave</em> it to him. Leading to this exchange:
