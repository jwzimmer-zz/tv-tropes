But then WHAM  something unexpected happens, and the tide turns in the heroes' favor, allowing them to overcome the villain and win.
</p><p>This is what we call a Near-Villain Victory, where the bad guys look like they're going to win only to get defeated at the last moment.
</p><p>It is a given that in battles between the forces of good and evil, the heroes will win most of the time and the villains will be defeated in the end. So, the writers will come up with scenarios that stack the odds in the villains' favor and give them minor victories, thus raising tension by getting the audience to think that <em>maybe</em> this time the hero won't save the day.

However, Tolkien considered it a defining characteristic of an <em>eucatastrophe</em> that it is ultimately not brought about by the hard work of mortal heroes, but by some intervention or action beyond the heroes' control—in effect, a miracle. Hence not every Near Villain Victory is an Eucatastrophe.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Occurs in the Cell Saga, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Cell who was thought to have died when he self-destructed comes back thanks to his regeneration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> and is now even STRONGER than Super Saiyan 2 Gohan. Cell launches a MASSIVE Kamehameha wave with the intent of blowing both the Z-Warriors and the earth away and it's all Gohan can do but hold him off in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> struggle which he is slowly losing ground in (the anime, which thankfully was kept in <em>Kai</em>, included the Z-Warriors helping out by firing energy blasts at Cell from behind. Though he manages to deflect them through pure energy alone). Then all of a sudden, Vegeta blasts Cell from behind distracting him long enough that Gohan can push both Kamehameha waves back at Cell, killing him off for good.
</li><li> At around the same time of Vegeta's attack, Goku (who recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">died to save the planet from Cell's self-destruction</a>) appeared in spirit form to tell Gohan that he's really still strong enough to kill Cell, because his broken arm doesn't actually do anything to weaken him. Cue both Goku (in spirit form) and Gohan doing the Kamehameha at the same time.
</li><li> In the movies, this is kinda Broly's thing. Example: Pre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> (well, we're talking about a show where the heroes are exponentially more powerful every season and the Return is about 10 years later), Broly is in a different league from the heroes, to the point no one in the entire cast can so much as stand toe-to-toe with him and trade blows. Broly is so powerful that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> Vegeta is <em>too scared</em> to fight him until most of the cast is near death. Then Vegeta is put down in about 5 seconds. Goku, with the combined remaining power of the entire cast, lands one punch and it looks like Broly blows up from his own overpowered-ness. And then the planet blows up for unrelated reasons.
<ul><li> The Return: Well, teenage Gohan can go toe-to-toe with Broly now. Broly shows a tiny amount of what could be construed as fear when Gohan goes Super Saiyan 2... at which point Broly goes Legendary Super Saiyan and proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> anything Gohan throws at him. He reacts a little bit to being drowned IN LAVA. The following is possibly the most intimidating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno">Out of the Inferno</a> ever. Because, y'know, LAVA. Gohan and his little brother Goten only manage to defeat him with assistance from the spirit of the then-dead Goku.
</li><li> But only because a side attack from Trunks distracted Broly. Had Trunks not regained consciousness or if Broly ignored the attack, he almost certainly would have destroyed the Earth. Like father, like son.
</li></ul></li><li> The Buu saga is arguably <em>the</em> darkest hour for the heroes: Buu has killed nearly everyone on Earth and absorbed Piccolo, Goten, Trunks and Gohan, the last of which Goku was planning to fuse with to defeat Buu. The only people left for Goku to fuse with are Mr. Satan the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a>, and Dende, who's needed to keep the Dragon Balls working. Only the surprise return of Vegeta (who had previously died in a failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>) turns things around.
</li><li> King Piccolo also comes <em>very</em> close to winning during the King Piccolo Saga of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. He got the Dragon Balls to give him eternal youth and killed the dragon so no one could ever use the Dragon Balls against him. He also murdered a large number of the strongest fighters in the world, beats Goku so bad that his heart stops, and seizes control of the entire world, turning it into a living hell. The <em>only</em> reason he ultimately lost is because he never anticipated that Goku was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a>, at least the anime version anyway. Everyone except Ginta, Babbo and Jack are dead, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is attacking Earth, and it looks like all is lost. Then Snow merges with Koyuki to allow Ginta to use the magic stone inside of her to defeat the Orb and resurrect everyone. Think about that, if Snow hadn't died beforehand, everyone would've been screwed. The manga averts this however, with a laughably easy final battle in which none of the heroes even get so much as a scratch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: Often Dr. Hell and his followers were on the brink of winning, and only through of extreme competence and sacrifice of Kouji and his allies or of utter incompetence of Hell's minions, the situation was saved. It happened several times when they very nearly took the Institute over (the most prominent of them happened in episode 57) or invaded it successfully (episode 87), or managed to steal a sample of Alloy Z... However the most notorious of them happened in the last episode when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Archduke Gorgon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeasts</a> destroyed Mazinger-Z and demolished the Institute. Tetsuya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment saved Kouji's life, but the villains finally were victorious against Mazinger.</span> That story was greatly expanded in the Mazinger vs Great General of Darkness movie.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>: Several of them. Two of them stand out:
<ul><li> In the Gosaku Ota manga episodes, Great Marshall of Darkness sucessfully blackmailed Japanese army into destroying Great Mazinger and the Fortress of Science. The army bombarded the Fortress and stormed into the place before blowing it up completely, and the heroes were forced to flee and lie low for a while. Meanwhile, Mykene army conquered Japan.
</li><li> In the last episodes of the anime and Gosaku Ota manga, the Mykene army struck the Fortress <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and in the manga, Marquis Janus traped Misato and cut her in half</span>, and attacked Mazinger-Z and Great Mazinger separately. Kouji and Tetsuya nearly got killed, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prof. Kabuto commited a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save Tetsuya.</span> The generals of the Mykene army laughed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Five minutes later they were not laughing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em>: One of the best examples happened in the two-part finale of the first season. Grendizer had been beaten by two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeasts</a> and forced to hiding, Kouji's TFO had been badly damaged, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Blackie</a> had taken control of the Science Space Center and tortured Dr. Umon. When Duke returned, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he managed beat both mechas, saving his friends and destroying Blackie's command ship.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> It's an unwritten rule in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">and its</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">spinoffs</a> that the protagonist can't win with more than 500 Life Points.
<ul><li> Sometimes subverted or outright averted, most notably in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">5Ds</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> Crow wipes the floor with some security guards in about one turn. Also, Yusei <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> defeated Kiryu with 1400 LP on his second try</span>, so the above rule might remain unwritten.
<ul><li> But Crow plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Blackfeathers</a>...

The heroes are there but since paper is their main weapon, there's none on hand. Trying to talk things out doesn't work.

The robot's turned away because no one liked Spider-Man, so it makes up a story about knowing where missing teammate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is. On the rescue mission the robot systematically separates and takes out all the Avengers, but before he can finish them off the real Spider-Man shows up upset at the impostor and in battle figures out how to shut off the robot. Predictably, Kang learns of his failure and hangs his head in shame.
</li><li> This plan worked so well though that when the robot got turned back on by accident it, once again, managed to subdue the current lineup of Avengers, and that wasn't even its goal this time.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> not only loved this trope (it appears throughout his books), he also proposed the term "eucatastrophe" for it and identified it as the typical ending of his definition of fairy stories in his essay "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnFairyStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnFairyStories">On Fairy-Stories</a>". He also pointed out that a lot of beloved stories that don't fit into the fairy-tale category have a similar structure—like the central dogma of Christianity, which is about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> Himself being killed,</em> and then coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>.

</li><li> The Battle at the Black Gate - in which most of the main characters expected to die in an attempt to give Frodo a chance - is not the primary eucatastrophe. The real one is Frodo failing at the end of his quest and, in a wonderful twist of fate, Gollum destroying the Ring <em>by accident</em>, which turns everything around, defeating Sauron, which in turn confuses his armies, allowing Aragorn &amp; co to win.

But Moran, who has been consistently treated poorly by Moriarty, feels that Moriarty would be fine seeing him go to jail to get on with his evil maths.

The strange thing is that Stannis is the closest thing to a 'good guy' in the situation, although it's definitely not a total inversion due to the series's notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Black and Grey Morality</a>.

<ul><li> The writers and producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> have perfected this to such a degree that they should copyright this trope. The villains generally cause enough damage before they are defeated up to the point where the heroes simply won't get to celebrate.
</li><li> Illyria of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> suffered this on her return. Despite the best efforts of the heroes to stop her, she successfully reached the dimension hiding her invincible army... only to find that the army had been destroyed in the ages since she was sealed away.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, the Minbari succeeded in obliterating most of EarthForce and had arrived at Earth with the intent to completely eradicate all humanity. Their sudden decision to surrender to the humans that they very clearly had on the ropes was one of the biggest plot points throughout the series.
</li><li> The best <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> example comes at the end of season four, wherein Adam is only defeated by Buffy coming up with a spell to tap mystical ancient powers that give her the power, knowledge, and skills of Giles, Xander and Willow.
<ul><li> The spell required that they be close by (no just popping a spell pill and rushing off to the enemy's lair) so they <em>all</em> had to infiltrate a fortified underground base safely, then successfully reach a room where they hopefully wouldn't be bothered by the <em>rampaging monster hordes</em> and then, even when the spell is activated, there's a) the possibility it won't work at all, b) the possibility it won't work as intended, c) the possibility of it not being reversible (effectively killing Giles, Xander and Willow while making Buffy almost a demigod, and the longer the spell is active, the higher than probability gets) and d) the (proven) possibility of bad side-effects. So, it was kind of a hail mary, not something anyone really wanted to do unless they had to.
</li><li> Seriously awesome when Buffy uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Willow's</a> power and Giles' knowledge to turn missiles into doves.
<ul><li> Another example comes during the final battle in season 7: Buffy and Robin Wood are both stabbed, The Slayers are being overwhelmed and killed by Turok Han, Spike and Willow are incapacitated, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anya</span> is killed.

<ul><li> In the very first episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehogS01E01SSSSSSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehogS01E01SSSSSSquad">Super Special Sonic Search and Smash Squad</a>", Scratch and Grounder catch Tails, forcing Sonic to give himself up lest Tails be hurt. Both of them are successfully imprisoned with no escape in sight and the two robots call Robotnik in to claim their reward. Their scheme only fails because Coconuts wants to take credit and Sonic successfully tricks the monkey into putting Scratch and Grounder in the cage so that he could escape. Had Coconuts not interfered, Robotnik would've won before the show even hit its second episode! Of course, being that it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a> being told by Sonic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">it's only natural things turned out the way they did</a>.
</li><li> Robotnik actually comes very close to defeating Sonic a fair few times. He does so each time he gains a Chaos Emerald in the four-parter arc, only for Sonic to usually manipulate some time paradox against him.
</li><li> Another example from the Chaos Emerald saga is in the third part, "Robotnik's Pyramid Scheme", where Sonic's Egyptian ancestor never met his future wife at a chilli dog stand, leading Sonic himself subject to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a>.

Robotnik promises Wes Weasely his own shopping channel in exchange for helping him with this plan, but it is later revealed that Weasely isn't actually allowed to broadcast it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal">This inspires Weasely to turn against Robotnik and help Sonic save his friends</a>.
</li><li> Momma Robotnik comes closest of all in "Momma Robotnik Returns" when she disguises herself and becomes Sonic and Tails' legal guardian; Sonic is practically helpless to stop her from taking over Mobius with a supercomputer, since she takes Tails hostage. Sonic has to be saved by Coconuts and none other than Robotnik himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal">both of whom rat her out to a social worker to avenge her mistreatment of them</a>.
