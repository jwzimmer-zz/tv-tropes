</p><p>During the course of a game, the price of a valued commodity will go up, usually several times, to the point where it's prohibitive to actually buy this commodity. Heaven help you if you can't find this commodity in the game normally.
</p><p>Take, for example, inn prices. The farther out from the origin point one goes, the more expensive a night at the inn is. It does not matter if the inn is in a capital city, or whether it's in a podunk village in the middle of nowhere. To understand the significance of why this is wrong, consider the following: which is going to be more expensive, given properties of approximately the same size and number of stars: a hotel room in Manhattan near Times Square, or one in Poughkeepsie? (If you don't know where Poughkeepsie is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity">you've proven the point</a>.) The point is: One night's stay at an inn late in the game costs about as much as buying the entire metropolitan city you started out in.

</p><p>Named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdamSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdamSmith">Adam Smith himself</a> (the one from the 18th Century, <em>not</em> George Goodman, the current-day writer on finance who uses this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName">Pen Name</a>), who is usually considered to be the father of modern economics. Common in games that manage to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>, and justified from a design standpoint as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink">Money Sink</a> to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">Money for Nothing</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandAndConquerEconomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandAndConquerEconomy">Command &amp; Conquer Economy</a>. A hero with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentHeroismRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentHeroismRating">100% Heroism Rating</a> might be able to get a discount, though.
</p><p>Ironically often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarlMarxHatesYourGuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarlMarxHatesYourGuts">Karl Marx Hates Your Guts</a>, where the gaming economy is stacked against you so that all goods have a globally fixed price, but you can never sell things for that price, so becoming a successful businessperson is nigh impossible without serious abuse of the system. Going back to our example of the inn, the inn in Poughkeepsie and the inn in Times Square are both the same price (Karl Marx hates you), <em>and</em> that price keeps going up (Adam Smith hates you).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>It's worth noting that, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, a person like the player character has what classical economics would call a <em>perfectly inelastic</em> demand for certain commodities. This means that, no matter what the price is, the player <em>will</em> manage to raise the funds <em>and</em> be willing to fork them over simply because they <em>need</em> to buy these items. Any merchants who are aware of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">can and will charge absurd amounts of money</a>, because they know it will sell regardless, so long as there isn't someone selling it cheaper nearby. Of course, behavioral economics reminds us that human beings are not constructs in classical economic theory, and so are prone to making decisions about prices that take into account more than just supply and demand. The most audacious form of the trope, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_gouging">Price Gouging<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a two edged sword, however: In many places raising the price of gasoline and bottled water during a hurricane isn't just a good way to be branded a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> by the local community- it can be grounds for criminal charges and seizure of goods. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wg3f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0wg3f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wg3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CourtSystems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CourtSystems">Laws vary, obviously</a> even within nations- some areas have specific laws against it, some categorize it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">extortion</a>, others consider it a form of public endangerment, and some just have officers point out to the owner the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">large angry mob armed with tire irons</a> forming outside and the inherent problems of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger">One Riot, One Ranger</a>. Surprisingly, some economists will defend price gouging. If your town is hit by a hurricane and the only guy selling batteries hasn't raised prices, you can bet he's been cleaned out and there's no batteries left in his store. Furthermore, there's no incentive to take risks to get those batteries. However, if the only guy selling batteries charges twenty-five USD for an AA four pack (a 6-8x spike in price), there's a good chance at least a few will be still on the shelves as people buy only what they absolutely need. Furthermore, batteries will flood into the area as sellers try to take advantage of the situation, renewing the supply of batteries and sending the price back down.</span> Additionally, even strongly pro-capitalist governments tend to pass anti-monopoly laws forbidding this sort of thing in the large scale.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroDiscount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroDiscount">No Hero Discount</a> (which is where storekeepers charge full price even though you're saving their butts).

<ul><li> The first edition of AD&amp;D included rules for training costs in order to advance a level once you had earned the necessary experience points. The time required varied depending on how well you had played your class, as rated by your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Dungeon Master</a>. Training time was 1-4 weeks at a rate of 1,500gp times your level per week, plus the cost of paying your tutor, until you reached 9th or "Name" level, then it was a different base rate tmes your level per week based on your class <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10isu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10isu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10isu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fighters actually got a break in costs, with only 1,000gp per level per week, whereas Magic Users had to spend the most at 4,000gp per level per week</span> and you no longer needed to hire a trainer. This was a pretty steep expense at lower levels. Higher levels were even more expensive <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note279lt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note279lt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note279lt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A 13th level Magic-user needed 1,500,001 experience points to advance to 14th level, and had to pay around 50,000gp for the training</span>, but high-level characters also had so much wealth that they could afford the training costs fairly easily. Most groups at the time just ignored the training rules completely, and later editions of the game have made their version of the training rules optional and much less expensive, if they included them at all.
<ul><li> In the first computer adaptations, the "Gold Box" games, training cost 1,000 gold times the character's (current) level and didn't take any in-game time. This was actually an inversion, since you had few resources early on, but after completing a few quests you could always afford to promote a 2nd or 3rd level character when they had earned enough experience points, and gold was so plentiful that eventually <em>no</em> expense was beyond your means.
</li></ul></li><li> In third edition magic items had their price overhauled to be a great deal more than earlier editions, for example the base price of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBall">Crystal Ball</a> went from 5,000gp to 42,000gp. The game was also balanced so that characters were expected to have a certain gross worth of magic items, and characters who did not have those items at higher levels were generally unable to compete. Magic items could be constructed at a reduced cost and you could even make a profit making and selling them, but they also cost you experience points to construct.
</li><li> Fourth edition, for ease of play everything has a fixed standard price (particularly visible in the way the cost of any magic item is purely a function of its level). Fair enough. However, player characters can never sell anything (<em>including</em> magic items) not explicitly put into the game as a cash-substitute treasure by the scenario designer for more than 20% of it's notional 'market price'... (There's a reason for that, and it's that the game developers explicitly wanted to encourage players to take their characters <em>adventuring</em> rather than have them sit around using weeks and months of in-game downtime making stuff to generate more money. But it still fits the trope to a T.)
<ul><li> And honestly, 20% is not all that strange if you look at it from an economic perspective; sure, the merchant seems like they're ripping you off, but how often do high-level adventurers come by town? In the default assumption, the heroes are pretty much THE heroes, and there just aren't all that many other people who would be capable of buying that + 5 flaming bastard sword that you sold to Bob's Used Weapon Emporium.
</li></ul></li><li> In Fifth Edition, it's stated that magic items would hardly ever be available for sale, but a table is given stating their approximate values based on rarity. A potion you can drink once that lasts for ten minutes can cost you the same as a ring or cloak that has a permanent effect, if the potion produces an effect that is more rare.
</li><li> A special case is also the component cost for the Raise Dead ritual. It starts at 500 gold pieces' worth of materials... until a character reaches 11th level, whereupon it suddenly increases by a factor of <em>ten</em> — and then the same thing happens once more upon hitting level 21 (of 30 possible). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwaved</a> by the game as 'death being less willing to return great heroes'. <br/>This because death has to be significant enough that it is meaningful, but not significant enough that dying is a major disruption to the game. 500 gp is a pittance to a mid to high level character, so the cost needed to be increased in order to make it at least mean something. It is a constant struggle in such games for death to be meaningful, but not crippling. In previous editions, you lost levels for dying and being raised, so this is a significant step forward as far as pricing goes.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <a class="urllink" href="http://ffn.nodwick.com/?p=306">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FullFrontalNerdity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FullFrontalNerdity">Full Frontal Nerdity</a></em> strip.
</li><li> A relatively recent addition to the 4th-edition rules is item rarity. Common items can be purchased, created by PCs, and sell for the usual 20%. Rare items, however, cannot be crafted or bought — they only turn up as loot if the DM specifically places them. The good news is that they sell for 50% (or even 100%) of their list price.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> went to a ridiculous extreme in justifying and averting this trope. Magic items are balanced via a relatively simple economic system they built for the game (and explain to any GM who wants to change it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em> is based on this principle. As the game goes on, the players acquire more and more property, monopolize what they can, and charge higher and higher rents to other players who land on their property. Players whose income does not increase fast enough to pay off increasing rents will eventually be eliminated, until only one remains.
<ul><li> In fact, Monopoly was originally created as a <em>criticism</em> of the effect of private rents, as a demonstration of how it leads to mass ownership of land by a single entity. In the very first version of Monopoly, you were then supposed to play a second round with slightly altered rules that limit the ability for one player to take over: but this was quickly dropped when it entered the mass market because it's a game and pretend-bankrupting your friends is fun, at least to people who enjoy Monopoly.

<ul><li> This tends to happen with most MMORPGs that feature intra-player market mechanics. Rare and special items are usually sold at insanely inflated prices. It gets worse the longer the game runs, as the past limited-time and rare items become more sought after, and the currency glut gets bigger and bigger.

</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the Sega Saturn RPG <em>Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean</em>: the cost of staying at any inn in the game is based upon the number of party members, and nothing else.

This is ostensibly to prevent farming infinite cash.
<ul><li> Even worse, raw materials are never subject to any loss of value; if the first pelt is worth 200 pounds, the hundredth will be worth exactly the same. That means that other than for merchant requests, it's almost never worth the trouble to craft anything.

It is justified, though: you are in a super-capitalist dystopia in the aftermath of a civil war, where the 1st act takes you through the medical pavilion and the fisherman's wharf, whilst the 3rd takes you through the uptown residential district, where demand for ammo would be higher.

The further into the game you are, the more expensive consumables get. And the shop is run by beings who are said to worship Hunters like you and wish only to serve them.

Of course, the game has an economy that can be best described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">Money for Nothing</a> incarnate, so you've got practically nothing <em>but</em> ammo you can spend your ever-increasing cash reserve on. The same goes with the "death" regeneration cost of 7% of your total funds. Normally this isn't a problem but some of the areas, while having lower-level enemies, can be more tricky, and with rewards reduced, can quickly drain your cash reserves if you're too careless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveHeroYuusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveHeroYuusha">Brave Hero Yuusha</a></em>: Landia's inn costs 20G, Garmuldar's inn costs 50G, while Duneport's costs 35G, and the former is only slightly further away than the latter, though, the former is a city, while the latter is a port, so it may be Justifed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cadash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cadash">Cadash</a></em> arcade game has a huge case of this. There are three ways to heal in the game. One is a magical herb that restores 10 hp when you would otherwise die (with a stock cap of either 8 or 4, depending on settings). The second is an elixir, which has a stock limit of one, there are only two of in the entire game, and you can only use automatically after all your herbs are gone and you would otherwise die. Method 3 is to stay at an inn. The inn price more than doubles each time you stay at one. It is completely impossible to afford every inn if you stay at one after each section, so you must put off that first visit as long as possible.
<ul><li> Time extensions are also subject to this.
</li><li> This is why the Priestess, despite having the slowest attack and no offensive spells, is BY FAR the easiest character get a one-credit clear with. The advantage of healing and (especially) protective magic in keeping inn expenses to a minimum is just that great.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> is an interesting case of this. The Librarian is the only one to sell you anything in the game, and while his prices don't go up, they obviously are significantly pricier than items in later games. For example, a simple Potion, which restores 50 HP, typically runs, on average, about 200 gold in many of the later games, though it gets a bit pricier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></em> at 500 Gold. Potions in this game cost a pretty hefty <em>800 gold</em>!! And given that this is in a game where you're most likely to find money in increments of $5-$25 at any one time most commonly, this is a pretty significant extortion for the most basic healing item. And unlike later games, candles have set drops and don't drop varying amounts of money if your heart count is full. Given that Symphony is a fairly easy game, however, and food items are pretty common, this isn't really THAT big of a deal.
<ul><li> This is actually a character point, as the Librarian is hesitant to aid Alucard as it would be blatant betrayal of Count Dracula, who the Librarian is apparently quite loyal to. It's only by appealing to his greed that Alucard is able to buy anything at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, before you do Ozzie's sub-quest at the end of the game, the Medina market <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeaserEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeaserEquipment">charges insane prices for his low-level gear</a>. Once you complete the quest, though, his prices become more reasonable; because you killed Ozzie in the past, the Mystics, who live in the village, never held a grudge against humans. Interestingly, they also sell some high level gear there at even MORE exorbitant prices, thus keeping it out of your reach. By the time you lower the cost, this is pointless as you are a couple tiers of equipment above what is sold there. However, it is quite possible to have enough just enough money to purchase a weapon you aren't supposed to get for another 10 hours pretty early in the game, even with the massively inflated price. Oops.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> has an odd variant of this trope. The 'prices' of buildings and units, in the form of hammers (required production to build it), stays constant, no matter which era you're in. Thus, erecting a building in a newly built town will take exactly the same number of turns in the stone age as it will in the modern era, after building cranes, construction equipment and unionised labour has been invented. At the same time, buildings and units you unlock with better technology that you research later are prohibitively more expensive in terms of hammer cost. This leads to odd situations where you have a new town in the modern era where building a TV station (which is unlocked in the modern era) takes over eight times longer than building a library (unlocked upon learning how to read) or a Colosseum (unlocked by construction), and training a unit of riflemen takes four times as long as training a unit of longbowmen (which would be the opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>). That being said, in most forms of the game, it is much easier to <em>get more hammers</em> later in the game (i.e. have increased productivity) by building improvements.

<ul><li> While you can sell whatever you produce in the game in Europe, the prices you get decrease over time. Also, the price you have to pay to buy products or military units from Europe increases. You can theoretically avoid this by trading with Native Americans or with other colonies, but it never seems to work in your favor.
</li><li> The trope is also literally inverted. You can recruit Adam Smith himself into your Continental Congress, in which case he loves you and wants you to succeed. Unless a rival colony snatches him away from you.
</li><li> The Firaxis remake makes the latter impossible, as once you get a Founding Father, he's yours. No other colony can get him. Whether or not this is good depends on whether or not you were able to get him first.
</li><li> FreeCol has the initial amount of goods on market explicitly established in the ruleset, which mostly affects price elasticity — you could eventually buy all 10000 tons of food and sometimes it could even make sense to try, but since one caravel takes only 200, it will take forever even if you could churn out goods to sell back to Europe equally fast (which won't happen, since New World goods have only 1000 reserve and prices fall quickly). Natives simply shift goods from "very interested" to "also can be traded" category after one transaction, so you would get the best deal by cycling wares between visits accordingly, and packing holds full when they are ready to buy high — until a village wants something you don't have.

Where the first clicker (the least-efficient building) costs 15 cookies to produce, the 150th will set you back over 19,000,000,000, and building more expensive buildings can cost in the trillions after you've built enough.

This is especially ridiculous when you consider that you're traveling around a land where most of the towns have been thoroughly devastated by the Revenants. The people you're hiring ought to be grateful just to have a job, especially one where the employer pays for all their equipment...
</li><li> The economy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hacking into ATM networks will usually give the player somewhere between 100 — 500 credits a pop. Credit Chits are rare and few between. Yet, everyone and anyone who sells you "second-hand goods" will charge you 700 credits for a clip of ammo (6 shots, which early enough in the game, could go quick), up to 2000 or more for a weapon add-on (accuracy mod, scope, etc.). On the other end of this problem, you can find this crap laying around ALL OVER the place.
</li><li> Not to mention that most of the people who take thousands of credits off your hands for relatively common items are somehow still homeless despite apparently sitting on money machines.
</li><li> However, you play an elite government agent and completing your assignments efficiently and following orders reaps commissions and performance bonuses, totaling thousands of dollars. <em>Deus Ex</em> encourages players to work hard, be curious, <em>and</em> loot for maximum survivability.
</li><li> This is even lampshaded at one point later in the game; if you pay someone's 5000 credit asking price for a suit of thermo-camouflage, which is a huge amount of cash for something that is neither that rare nor that amazingly useful, he'll be dumbfounded anyone was willing to go for his offer.
</li><li> The game actually does a good job at keeping your resources just ahead of demand, which with the multiple solutions to any given puzzle means that you could be drowning in lockpicks while carrying around seven different guns in the false hope that one of them might have enough ammo to get you through the next firefight. On an economic basis, part of the plot is that the economy is screwed on a massive scale.

As you buy stock, the price increases, and as you sell stock, the price goes down. Because the player the only <em>real</em> buyer, the price is inflated as one buys and deflates as one sells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, a market developed in trading items between players: but the game's "official" currency, gold, quickly became worthless due to inflation as most items were valued at more gold than a character could ever carry or transfer. Instances of a particular rare magic item, the Stone of Jordan, became the unofficial currency, then later high level runes became the standard.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>, the position was effectively reversed by the Auction House massively simplifying player trading: at any difficulty level but Inferno (the highest), most item treasure that drops can be ignored as players on higher levels will be getting much better items as "junk" and selling them off for tiny amounts of gold. This wiped out the value of several in-game crafting mechanisms. Blizzard eventually killed both the gold and real money auction house, made most things untradeable and increased loot drop rates and quality dramatically. The fans were initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">rather divided about it</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>, each town has a fixed price for its inn, multiplied by how many people you have in your party. Once you have access to the "zoom" spell you can just fly back to Stornway every time you need to heal and then zoom back to the place you need to be. This saves you at most about 20 coins each time you rest your whole party so really there isn't much point...

<ul><li> Generally averted throughout the series. All items have a "base price", with the actual price you pay based on a number of factors including (depending on the game) your related attributes/skills (Personality, Speechcraft, Mercantile), the merchant's disposition, and faction association between you and the merchant. While there is some variance from merchant to merchant due to these factors, the same item will cost relatively the same amount regardless of whether you're buying it one hour into the game or one-hundred.

The only thing keeping it from being a monetary game breaker is that merchants only have a certain amount of gold available per day, so you'll need to wait for that to reset.

<ul><li> It's actually possible to invert this and still have the market hate you; Dragon Bone drops will become so frequent alongside enchanted Daedric artifacts that simply selling <em>one piece</em> will bankrupt the store owner if you don't have any merchant perks or accept the "loss". On top of that several merchants only buys one type of loot (food, armor, weapons, or potions) with only a handful in each town that would buy any loot, so careful management is also needed so that you don't sell to the easiest merchants first and end up unable to sell the rest.
</li><li> Getting full price for an item in <em>Skyrim</em> is difficult but not impossible. It requires (deep breath) 100 in speech (one of the slowest increasing skills), many perks to increase profits + seller available gold and a magical boost to barter. The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/comic/supply-and-demands">merchant perk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is also required to sell any item to any vendor.

Items and equipment are also rather pricey — in the first two games, a single Nectar costs a whopping 500en. In <em>The Drowned City</em>, healing items get a much needed price drop, such as Nectars now only costing a mere 50en. Ironically, the shopkeeper here is a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">Money Fetishist</a>; probably best if she doesn't find out she's selling this stuff at such a staggering discount...

CCP decided that they weren't needed, and removed the blueprints for Basic modules. Now they fetch massive prices on the market; it's mostly item collectors who buy them.
</li><li> Civilian items also suffer from this; since they're basically useless, there's far less Civilian items than anything else. It's common to see a normal frigate-grade Afterburner selling for 15,000 ISK, and a Civilian Afterburner selling for <em>300,000</em>. Somebody actually made a Brutix (Gallente Battlecruiser) that was fitted with nothing but Civilian modules. It was named Civil Minded".
</li><li> Faction issue modules can cost over a hundred times more than there tech II variants and give marginally improved stats, which is certainly worth it for some ships. Where this trope really comes into play is that certain faction modules are much rarer than others because it is not popular to work for those factions, however many faction modules share identical stats. So an Ammatar issue module might be a federation navy issue module in all but name but it still costs twice as much.

Similarly, they will spend more to buy items they don't have than they will for items they have a surplus of. This opened the door to a cheat where you could essentially sell him 99 of an item time they didn't have (which he would pay handsomely for), then buy all 99 of those items back (which he will sell to you very cheaply), and turn a profit. Doing this repeatedly with high-price items (like engagement rings or precious gems) effectively becomes an infinite gold supply.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, however, plays this painfully straight as the markups for items sold and markdowns for items bought has been increased to 150-1122%, forcing the player to rely on the new crafting system in order to get anything for themselves even with perks that reduce prices and salespeople who offer discounts! Even then you can't produce your own ammo without downloadable content (be it a <em>Workshop</em> DLC or by mods) and fining junk requires putting a settler to a scavenging station (and thereby putting them to a job that literally everyone else does in automatically).

Even plans, the things required to craft different items, are seldom worth the caps — unless it's a particularly rare plan, you're better off hoping you find it naturally. Oh, and you can't sell ammo and plans to vendors.

Combining Mystic Stones costs ten times as much as Jaffy charges, while recovery items cost <strong>forty times</strong> more than they cost everywhere else. (And no, sell prices are not adjusted.) Since you lose collected gold as well when you leave, it's worth paying his prices anyway.

The ammo is in perfect condition, and packs more punch than the homemade crap you usually find. Therefore, you must choose between supporting the economy and saving your ass in a firefight. There's even an Achievement (Scrooge) for hoarding 500 Bullets.
</li><li> In general, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> developers are aware of this trope and will often build <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink">money sinks</a> into their games to remove excess cash from players' wallets, with varying levels of success. Do you twink your alt or drop 20K on a giant mammoth or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">motorcycle</a>? The most reliable money sink is armor repairs. If you play end-game content, this can drain you of several hundred gold a night on progression days.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Moonlighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Moonlighter">Moonlighter</a></em> The player themselves is free to invoke this for once, but it is actually advised against. Will can inflate his prices to extraordinary amounts, but it'll turn people off from visiting Moonlight in the future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER">Mother</a></em> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> seems to avert this trope for most of the game, as you <em>start</em> in an insignificant little village, and the price of lodging naturally increases as you approach the big city of Fourside (which also happens to be dominated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>) and the resort towns of Summers and Scaraba. Additionally, shop prices never seem to change; the cup of coffee that costs $6 in Onett will be valued the same wherever you go. But then, near the end, you reach the Tenda Village and Adam Smith slaps you in the face: items of all sorts are hideously expensive (costing not money but a certain high-valued item that must be bought elsewhere), and the "ATM" people you find charge 100% handling fees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em> ties this into the main plot to an unusual extent. The pastoral Tazmily Village does not even use money at the beginning of the game, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plans include changing that.
</li></ul></li><li> Like most other "freemium" mobile games, Gameloft's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> allows you to play completely for free, earning an unlimited supply of coins within the game that can be used to buy new characters. But the game (as released) also utilizes additional currency systems, including "gems" that can only be earned at a rate of one a day and sometimes as quest rewards, and "hearts" which mostly require friends to visit your town and leave a gift (again at a rate of one heart per friend per day). Alternatively, the player can spend real money to buy gems and hearts. Players have worked out that to complete the game's main storyline requires the player to buy ponies and other objects that can only be bought by gems or hearts; as originally released, it would take 3 to 5 consecutive years of playing the game once a day to earn enough of these to buy all the required ponies. Alternatively, these could be bought through around $80 worth of gems. And then there's all the optional characters... Made worse when you consider this game, while having the brony audience from the TV show, is meant for kids.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/HordesOfTheUnderdark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/HordesOfTheUnderdark">Hordes of the Underdark</a></em>. The best magical items you find will only be worth pennies at first, but what the game doesn't tell you is that there's a cap to how much merchants will pay for any item no matter how valuable. The more you progress in the game the higher the cap raises, and in Chapter 3 you can get tens of thousands of gold for items that merchants in Chapter 1 only offered you a couple thousand for. Played straight with djinn merchant Volkarion, however — he rips you off horribly on the items you sell to him, and if you comparison shop with other merchants you can usually get one and a half times what he offers for the same item, if not much more.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6macm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6macm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6macm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Chapter 3, the devil merchant in Cania will pay up to 50,000 gold for an item, assuming it's actually worth up to that much. Volkarion won't go any higher than 15,000. That's hundreds of thousands of gold he's scamming you out of.</span> Of course, he's the merchant you can literally summon whenever and wherever you are.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame">Web Game</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewStarSoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewStarSoccer">New Star Soccer</a></em> has 'NRG' Drinks. Every time you sign a new contract, the prices increase. Near the end of the game, an energy drink can cost more than your <strong>HOUSE</strong> .
</li><li> Subverted in a locally-written game called <em>No</em> (to hide it from the system managers) which ran on the mainframe computer at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California back around the late 1980s. You got to travel around the galaxy buying and selling things, or alternatively, looting other ships and stealing their supplies. Planets had different technology levels, from 1 to 9. Goods became cheaper the higher the technology level, so that photon torpedoes at a #4 technology planet were less expensive than the ones at the #1 planet (which is how you made money, buying from H.T. planets and transporting goods to lower technology ones). Higher technology planets also did better things with ship's equipment, e.g. a #2 shield could provide more energy against other ships trying to fire on you to loot your ship than did a #1 shield, a #3 did better than a #2, and so on. If you bought a #3 shield at a #3 or higher technology planet, the price was in line with it being what it was worth, say, twice that of a #2. But buy a #3 at a #1 planet, however, and while the planet <em>would</em> sell it to you, the price might be 100 or 500 times as much, which is in line with demanding high technology in a place not equipped for it, it's much more expensive where they don't know how. Each planet's level was announced when you arrive, and prices were clearly marked on the price chart, but the program wouldn't prevent you from being stupid and not checking the price. Planetary technology levels were based on a formula as if to say some planets developed faster than others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> plays this straight, especially where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterstellarTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterstellarTravel">Hyperdrive</a> fuel is concerned. The stuff is necessary for your ship to be able to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>, and can easily gouge you of your hard-earned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency">Units.</a>

The increases are slight, and only apply to the items you actually bought, but they add up quickly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail">Oregon Trail II</a></em>, supplies get more expensive the farther out on the trail you go. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope">justified</a>, since the prices would include the additional costs involved in transporting them to a remote outpost. In an equally justified inversion, horses get significantly cheaper.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OrganTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OrganTrail">Organ Trail</a>: Director's Cut</em>, supplies get both more expensive and rarer the farther west you go. Initial stops have plenty of everything, but later stops may not have any supplies at all that you can buy, and what few supplies they have are fantastically expensive. In addition, repairing your car gets more expensive as well. (This is averted in the original Flash game, where supplies cost the same no matter where you are.)

<ul><li> Averted with the varying inn prices — they accurately reflect the wealth of the local area. The inn that charges the most coins, at 30 coins, is in Poshley Heights, which is essentially where all the rich people live high lifestyles; compare to criminal cesspool Rogueport, where the inn charges only 5 coins.
</li><li> It's also averted with some items which, depending on your location, will be cheaper or more expensive depending on how rare said item is in that area. One character even advises you in-game that a good way to make money is to buy fire flowers in Petalburg and sell them in Rogueport for a 2 coin profit.
</li><li> Played straight in the Pit of 100 Trials. There is a sleazy merchant who occasionally shows up in certain rooms to sell you various items at inflated prices. The lower you go, the more dangerous it gets, and the more likely it is you'll be running out of healing items. <em>He knows this</em>. By the time you get near the bottom, he'll be selling items for <em>twenty times</em> what they'd be worth in a normal shop. Since you're likely to be maxed out in coins yet an inch near death at this point, <em>these items might actually be worthwhile</em>
</li><li> Using a heart block almost invariably costs more in the dungeon for a respective region than in the open field.

When healing services are readily available in the overworld at much lower prices, Trish puts her stall <em>right in front of the level boss' door</em> — you can leave the level to get healed cheaply, or fall into her trap, unless you were smart enough to stock on items. She can also offer ice creams that increase various stats, a service also available in various Sumaru restaurants, and at a point she's left at the single source of trade. To absolutely no one's surprise, she starts selling stuff at five times its street value. There <em>is</em> an option to scatter a rumor to give her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> to lower her prices... which she promptly ignores, putting all prices back as they were.

<ul><li> The items get exponentially more expensive, which is made even more bizarre when you consider that your protagonists are Japanese school children, and that the person selling you the gear is a police officer who was fully aware of the situation.
</li><li> By the time things get <em>really</em> costly, you're getting so many Yen out of Tartarus that you could buy out <em>his entire inventory</em>. Apparently, he's also aware of this. Why the <em>swimsuits</em> are so expensive is a question for another day...
</li></ul></li><li> The Nurse's Office in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em>, similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> example above, will charge you based on the level of the main character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PixelDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PixelDungeon">Pixel Dungeon</a></em> features four shops in the dungeon, on levels 6, 11, 16, and 21. The price for each item rises by about 50% in each subsequent store. It is not as absurd as in some other examples of that trope, since the deeper levels are more dangerous and far from the surface, which makes it mor expensive to operate a shop there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketStables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketStables">Pocket Stables</a></em> has this in both the research and shopping aspects of the game. Every time you buy something, the price of that item goes up so that it's more expensive the next time you buy it. The same goes for researching of new breeds- every time you research a breed, the cost of researching the next breed goes up by 10 tokens.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a>: Everything costs the same amount wherever you go (though it does strike one as a little strange that a small shop in tiny little Mahogany Town would stock Ultra Balls when Goldenrod City's massive department store doesn't), and Pokémon Centers are always free.
</li><li> The fourth generation even averts the odd stock issues — the stock in all stores is dependent on how many badges you have — they just won't sell Ultra Balls to greenhorn trainers. The only city-dependent items are specialty balls that generally have explanations as to why they're only sold there (like selling balls that are better at catching Water-types in a fishing village).
</li><li> Also in Goldenrod City (both in the original Gold &amp; Silver and their fourth generation remakes) there is a "bargain shop" that sells you expensive items with no use other than being sold, at 90% of their selling price. However, you cannot get rich from it; the salesman is only there on Monday mornings, and only sells you one of each item each time. It's more of a steady income than anything.
</li><li> The fancy store in the center of Black City. $10,000 for a Poke Ball?

The sole exception to this is Issur the Blacksmith, but then he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> and will only hand over his bellows if you can beat him at arm wrestling; Wizards and Thieves will pretty much have to steal the bellows.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recettear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recettear">Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</a></em> plays with the trope in many ways:
<ul><li> In this game, <strong>you</strong> can be a blood gutter merchant who sets a price of whatever you sell very high. The tactic does work on one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>, but raising item's prices above 200% will piss off most of your customers.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7zj40');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7zj40" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7zj40');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The page image is a parody of this</span>. Some notable aspects of this:
</li><li> Average customers can be made to cough up 250% for food during a famine. As food demand is very inelastic, this is justified.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> when you buy your first wholesale stock for the express purpose of selling at an inflated price for profit — your fairy assistant mentions Adam Smith by name.
</li><li> And a great example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: in the unpatched game, the first "tutorial" customer will <em>never</em> walk out on a bad deal, meaning you can bid them up to several million for the very first item in the game.
</li><li> While the game <em>lets</em> you overcharge for items, it's actually kind of averted via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">hidden mechanics mentioned absolutely nowhere in game.</a> Customers will only like you if you give them good deals right out of the gate — i.e., no gouging or haggling — and fostering reputation is the only way they come in with more money over time (most notably, the first couple times this happens their budgets go up by a factor of almost 10). Following the tutorial's rule of selling at 130% is likely to get you comfortably through the first two weeks, then screw you in the second half of the month when nobody can afford the higher tier items you need to sell to keep up.
</li><li> Also subverted in that many players will also sell high-end adventuring gear at a loss to the various adventurers who come into the shop: this makes it much easier to go through dungeons with those characters, and if the adventurer brings their own personally owned gear rather than borrowed gear from the shop, it frees up extra space to bring back loot. If used intelligently, that extra loot will more than make up for the lost revenue from the initial sale.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robocraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robocraft">Robocraft</a> the costs of new parts for your robot start to get downright silly as you progress through the tiers. For instance, wheels are reasonably priced at a few hundred a pop in Tier 2. But in Tier 5, each one costs upwards of 4000. And it only goes up from there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a></em> there are two Doctors, a man and his wife. The first time you die you pay a fee if the male Doctor revives you, which doubles each time. So if you die "a lot" it gets INSANELY EXPENSIVE. Though as a bit of fairness if his wife revives you, she heals you for free, but that doesn't reset the male Doctor's ongoing fees.
</li><li> In the ARPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacred">Sacred</a> II</em>, high-level items are more expensive than low-level items. A level 120 healing potion sells for $1200, enough to buy 150 level 1 pots if you are level 1. And both heal exactly 24%. Further, one can merge one $1200 pot with 19 $12 pots, making a stack of 20 $1200 pots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG">SaGa</a></em> series:
<ul><li> This occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGa2">SaGa 2</a></em>: Hihō Densetsu<em>​ (rebranded and released as </em>Final Fantasy Legend II'' outside of Japan). It can be difficult enough to grow in strength since weapons have limited uses, and the prices go up by a huge amount as the game progresses, but there's a bug that occurs when you win a fight: each group of enemies is checked one by one to see if they drop meat (used to transform Monster class characters), but if you were fighting 3 different enemy groups, the game does not calculate dropped gold for the remaining groups if meat happens to be dropped by the first or second group. If you were fighting 3 different groups of enemies and the first group consisted of only 1 monster whereas the two others had 9 monsters in them, you would be ripped off of almost all the gold you should have obtained if the first monster group happens to drop meat because you will only get the full amount of gold you were supposed to get if the enemies do not drop meat, or if you're lucky enough that the last enemy group is the one to drop meat. As a result, making money is very frustrating because a lot of the time you'll only get 1/3 to 2/3 of the enemy groups dropping their gold.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier">Sa Ga Frontier</a></em>: You can exploit this trope. You can buy and sell gold nuggets in this game, and in one of the locales its price rises and falls as per the good old laws of supply and demand...except the game's programming recalculates the worth of your inventory <em>in the sell menu before any actual goods change hands</em>! So, start with an inventory of about a dozen or so gold nuggets, "sell" them until the price per ingot is zero, and then toggle the number of ingots that you're "selling" until the price raises to a level where actually selling them ingot by ingot nets you a profit. Then, travel to another locale where the price of gold is fixed and buy more ingots than when you started, and repeat for effectively infinite money.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore">Secret of Evermore</a></em>:
<ul><li> An interesting take on this: each of the four areas of the game uses an entirely different type of money (e.g. gold, gems or credits), and the <em>exchange rate</em> is where you get shafted, with e.g. 1 gold coin equal to 2 jewels or some such. Therefore, the item you buy may sell for the exact same price, but the currency in use is worth twice as much, so you're really paying twice as much for the same item.
</li><li> However, this is averted at the end of the game. The way this game works, the area you're in at that point is technically the first part of Evermore you get into it, predating the Prehistoric area, and in terms of currency, that means the exchange rate for this currency is at the lowest end of the hierarchy. If you saved up 25,000 coins, that makes 50,000 jewels, which makes 100,000 talons, which makes 200,000 credits.
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura">Senran Kagura</a></em> franchise, the Lingerie Lottery in Shinovi Versus has a system where the player's luck decreases the more lingerie the player purchases, forcing him/her to pay more for a better chance. It doesn't help that there are 98 pairs though.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> had outrageous prices for weapons and powerups. You earned money by taking jobs but since the jobs paid very little, you ended up having to do the same few missions over and over again in order to get enough money to progress in the game. However, if you know where to find the data buyer, earning a lot of money really fast becomes a cakewalk, so long as you have even a mildly competent decker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sometimes shops and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Trauma Inns</a> will jack up their prices at higher difficulties. In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em>, increasing the difficulty to the max will triple prices in every shop in the former, and the Ginza shops selling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a> and premium armor sets in the latter. In <em>IV</em>, a single full set of Ginza armor can easily exceed three million Macca in cost, and in <em>III</em>, collecting all Magatamas is heavily hindered by the added cost.
</li><li> Healing places in most games runs on a justified version of this. Healers generally charge based on how much they're healing, with different rates for HP, MP, statuses, and death. As you go through the game and get more health and magic, the prices will naturally go up for major heals. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em> got rid of this system, instead having full heals in underground towns at a constant, cheap price; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</a></em>, however, would introduce a traditional version of this trope. In addition to the bars, there are also healing spots in dungeons. All charge more than the bars, and they get more expensive throughout the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em> each progressive health and mana upgrade costs significantly more than the previous upgrade.
<ul><li> Relics are found in chests deep within each stage... which Chester has somehow already found. Not only will he charge you for the relic, but if you wait to buy it in the village he'll actually charge you more.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em>, Sims can actually have this as a <em>flaw</em>. It's called "Guild Enemy." Even when prices are low for everyone else in the kingdom (thanks to high Well-Being), the Guild Enemy has to pay a ridiculous markup unless he wants to go to non-Guild shops whose selection is pitiful.
</li><li> A rare aversion occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpiritEngine2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpiritEngine2">The Spirit Engine 2</a></em>: One of the endgame shopkeepers <em>does</em> agree to give you a discount. Played straight and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by the shopkeeper right next to him, however, who scoffs at you when you tell him you're about to save the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a></em> series:
<ul><li> This is justified in-game by the fact that the Earth Starbase itself has severely limited resources (and crew, natch!)
</li><li> In the second game, there are actions you can take <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8cvfd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8cvfd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8cvfd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">selling your crew to the Druuge to tend nuclear furnaces (and serve as fuel for same)</a></span></span> that will cause the price of crewmembers (effectively your life points in this game) to rise, along with the ire of your home station master.
</li><li> This will also occur if you consistently lose men you purchased from the Earth Starbase <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note998zz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note998zz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note998zz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This can easily happen if you try to use the pitiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Cyborg</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">Which except for very few specific instances guarantees the loss of a ship or 13</a> — instead of actually controlling your ships</span>, but this takes longer and can easily be offset by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> giving Tanaka (or his brother) a Shofixti maiden after repeatedly insulting him and escaping, thereby speedily repopulating the Shofixti race</span>.
</li><li> An inversion can occur via the Syreen Penetrator <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10phj3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10phj3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10phj3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">Blue Skinned Space Babes</a> ship, looks EXACTLY like you'd expect</span>, which has the ability to call crew from the opposing ship and capture them. Master this, and you start getting REWARDED for slavery, as you can then sell the enslaved crew back at the inflated price.
</li><li> Near the end of the game, there is a subversion when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Chmmr suddenly grant you unlimited resources to build anything you wish.</span> This can be a double subversion because your main badass supership needs to be converted into a flying bomb by the Chmmr in order to destroy the big bad's superweapon, effectively taking it out of the fight.
</li><li> The Druuge exhibit a couple of variations:
<ul><li> If you sell enough crew to the Druuge it is quite explicitly stated that you're effectively bribing people to join up with a known slave trader.
</li><li> You can also turn the tables on the Druuge in a very simple way. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yumm');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yumm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yumm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can sell them a small portion of your crew or one of a few various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> that you pick up on your travels and they will pay you by fully fueling up your ship. Now fuel can be bought and sold at your home starbase, and your ship can be reconfigured as one giant fuel tank. Go to the Druuge with an empty giant fuel tank, sell some crew or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, watch them fuel you right up and scream at how you pulled a savage burn on them! Then you fly back to your home starbase and sell all your fuel for a CRAPTON of cash to buy all the ships and expensive upgrades you'll ever need.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Justified and Lampshaded, with the Melnorme traders — their culture considers giving without receiving in turn to be vulgar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFlight">StarFlight</a></em>: The price of fuel for your vessel will DOUBLE several times over the course of the game, and while the rationale is provided for it in the reports you'll get, you won't get any warning that this is going to happen until you return home and see the price has doubled again. 
<ul><li> Once you know everything you need to beat the game properly, you can rush through and finish the story before the first date falls, thereby stalling the increase in price permanently. However, most players are unable to beat it to the first increase. As many find catching animals and finding new mine-able planets the gameplay's appeal, this seems intentional.
</li><li> Downplayed in the Genesis version, in which the price increases in relatively small increments. It's also fairly easy to amass enough money that the price increases don't hurt much.
</li></ul></li><li> The price of the Seltzer item in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em> increases linearly with the time spent playing the game on that file.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> does this with its Exchange as some items are priced in the hundreds of <em>millions</em> of Energy Credits, usually the more rare, have to use real cash to buy items and ships. This has lead to a massive abundance of player created missions for the sole purpose of amassing fortunes (which of course makes the problem worse by injecting even more money into the economy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles">Steambot Chronicles</a></em> has this happen with the price of fuel and parts/repairs as you progress through the story. Working through the story segments quickly and not recognizing the point where you can jump off and just go wandering about for a few game weeks can lead to severe cash flow problems and/or death. Prepared players, however, can easily amass a nice fat bankroll and a stockpile of parts to sell back to the shops at the newly-inflated prices, although that latter is only slightly better than breaking even.
</li><li> In the FPS/RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a></em>, the quartermaster at The Front base will give you a few assault rifle clips if you run out. Aside from that don't expect any hand-outs from him or from the citizens that you're trying to save from the evil empire/cult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSea">Sunless Sea</a>:</em> Mostly averted, as prices for goods vary depending on the setting and story reasons rather than any form of progress in the game, so prices only rise or fall depending on what kind of island or city you're currently visiting. The Khanate will invoke this, however, to scalp the utter hell out of you (as seen in the page quote), as they don't like Londoners much and will make you pay out the nose for even the most basic goods unless you've earned enough favor to have a Trader's license.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSkies">Sunless Skies</a>:</em> Averted, as whatever you buy in one port will likely have the exact same price being sold elsewhere, so no profit will be made; the actual profits in such operations are snatched up by bigger companies. There are both Bargains (opportunities at small ports where folks temporarily sell limited stock of an item at lower prices) and Prospects (commissions taken at the main ports where you deliver a certain amount of a certain good to a particular port, and they pay you a higher price and an extra shipping fee for gratitude once it's all delivered) to further tip the scale away and give you the chance for actual profits.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a> 2</em> with good stats and lucky clicks, you can either reprogram vendor machines to give items at lower prices, or change the stock altogether, replacing soda drinks with armor-piercing bullets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> The player can choose to avert this themselves in any <em>Tales</em> game by taking advantage of the fact that many commodities — especially food — don't cost as much in some areas as in others. It's possible to make ridiculous amounts of money as a merchant if you know the differences.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence">Tales of Innocence</a></em>, a bug made Hermana's Bear Claw sell for more than its own price.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia">Tales of Eternia</a></em>, not only does each successive town charge more for the inn, but the moment you visit an inn, every other inn you've ever been to increases <em>their</em> prices to match the new one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> — prices go up and down dependent upon actual availability. If a town is destroyed, its products get more expensive. If there's a war on, weapons are suddenly at a premium. On your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> you can take serious advantage of this by stocking up on items when they're cheap and unloading them when the price skyrockets.
<ul><li> However, the most expensive inn is in Sheridan at 600 Gald, unless you count the Keterburg Hotel, which is explicitly stated to be for the rich and does have a much cheaper Inn. This is compared to Daath, whose inn is 200 Gald. Sheridan's inn successfully beats out both capital cities. Prices for that, though, can be averted with the Mini Maven title for Anise.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> to some extent. Shops will still charge you, but certain events such as the dragon tours and trips to Thoda Geyser will not charge anything as the people can't take the Chosen's money.
</li><li> Defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em>. White Turtlez is first encountered at the start of a dangerous detour when the nearby town's stores are closed, intent to gouge pretty clear underneath his cheerful pitch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Velvet</a> calmly says she'll pay the going rate or take what she needs off his corpse, his choice. He pops up several times intending to pull the same trick, only for pretty much every party member to have a go at him. In an endgame secret area, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's found lamenting his debts and blaming the party for him having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">sell himself as soup ingredients</a> to pay them off. He gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">absolutely no sympathy</a> as the party point out for the umpteenth time that balancing his books on gouging the desperate makes him a bad merchant and a worse person.</span>
<ul><li> This is backed up by store prices being consistent the world over, since every civilization met is being incorporated into a command economy but the system hasn't had time to break under its own weight yet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Everyone with a lick of sense can see it coming, though, and a black market is already well-established</a>, but this is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> and not used outside of the plot.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the mobile game <em>Taps To Riches</em>, you play as a reformed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain">Supervillain</a> who wants to take over the world by legally buying every run down dump and upgrading them to make a fortune to pump into more upgrades. Being a mobile game, these prices start to get higher and higher until you have to wait days to purchase a single building, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">if you don't purchase in-game upgrades</a>.
</li><li> The current economy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>. Prior to the update that saw Team Fortress 2 gain Steam Marketplace compatibility, Crate Keys (generally $2.49 a pop) were traded at roughly 2.33 Refined Metal, gained from crafting 2 items together to make 1 Scrap, 3 Scrap together to get 1 Reclaimed, and 3 Reclaimed together to get 1 Refined. As soon as that update hit, the price of keys more than doubled, going from 2.33 Refined to 5 Refined in roughly 2 weeks due to people selling keys on the Steam Marketplace, usually undercutting the Mann Co price by 70 cents to a dollar. And keys still sell for $2.49 at the Mann Co store.
<ul><li> The Scout manages to hash the Heavy over this in a domination quote.
<div class="indent"><em>"$400,000 to fire that gun, huh? Yeah, money well spent. Them $200 bullets ain't so hot when they don't hit nothin', are they?!"</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive">Test Drive</a> Unlimited</em> suffers this with the police fines. They start off reasonable, but as the player progresses become ridiculous. Further, they are based off of the number cars the player collides with and the only tactic the police use to stop the player is running into him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyTower">Tiny Tower</a></em>, the price to build a floor goes up with each new floor built, even if the floor is always empty and therefore not making any coins.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTouryst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTouryst">The Touryst</a></em>. Whenever you sell diamonds found in the Soggy Island mines for money at Leysure Island's Cash2Go shop, the appraiser will haggle down your offers unless you sell for a rather low price relative to how many diamonds you've mined up.
</li><li> An extreme example of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation">Ridiculous Future Inflation</a> occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon">Transport Tycoon</a></em>. The game simulates inflation by making everything more expensive the longer one plays. If a player plays long enough, a regular bus will eventually cost more than the GNP of any (or with enough time played EVERY) country on Earth. In extreme cases, the AI may found a company so late in the game that the starting funds are not enough to buy a single vehicle, forcing bankruptcy right after building their headquarters!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureHunterG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureHunterG">Treasure Hunter G</a></em> had a surprisingly realistic aversion of this. The cost of items fluctuates depending on how rare they would be in that area. For example, items from the forest will be much more expensive in castle cities to buy or sell. This is actually how you make money in the game, since enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider">don't drop cash upon defeat</a>: Buy items where they're cheap (or find them in dungeons) and sell them where they are expensive. The game also helps you out in this regard somewhat: if you encounter a random NPC who is selling cheap low-level gear that stopped being useful two or three dungeons ago, you can count on being able to resell that gear for a profit in the next town.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tropico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tropico">Tropico</a></em> series, inflation occurs gradually over the course of the 20th century. Unless you raise the rates of Tropicans' earnings as well as gradually increase the price of your exports, you will have a lot of unhappy Tropicans noting the disparity between the average Caribbean wage rates and yours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun">Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun</a></em> works on a crude supply and demand scheme. This often makes it feel like Adam Smith Hates Your Guts because when a major war breaks out the cost of war materials can increase drastically. This is perfectly realistic of course, and if you happened to somehow coax your capitalists into building said weapons factories you might earn a tidy profit. A more straight version perhaps is that as technology (and hence production efficiency) increases so does demand: Unless you keep up the pace you might well end up with a population unable to buy the fancy new toys your factories are producing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld">Wario World</a></em>, there are machines that sell garlic (health). The later the level, the higher the price. Some machines will even raise the price for each clove that is bought.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">downplayed</a> example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMS3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMS3">Wild ARMs 3</a></em>; inn prices increase the longer one plays the game but stay reasonable even over long periods of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>
<ul><li> After the release of the "Burning Crusade" expansion, the market for low level items and materials soared due to vast amount of gold being generated by high level characters and the massive demand for low level gear for said high level character's low level alts.
</li><li> The inflation in the cost of flightpaths is a direct example of this trope. One can fly from one tip of the Eastern Kingdoms to the Other for less then a gold, but it'll cost that much to travel within the zone in Icecrown.
</li><li> The most flagrant example, however, is that because enemies drop magic items and other pieces of manufactured equipment, equipment manufactured by players is actually cheaper than raw materials. A character with two gathering professions (Herbalism, Mining, Skinning) is a good way of amassing a huge fortune quickly.
</li><li> A partial inversion occurs with faction rep discounts, getting to a higher reputation with a faction causes all vendors allied to that faction to offer you increasing discounts on all items.
