This can also occur when criminals who are too desperate to care give an account of their actions. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, the report describes such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">implausible set of circumstances</a> that the true cause is obvious.
</p><p>To get technical, in order to avoid misuse of this trope, let's look at what the coroner (or physician who signs the death certificate) must determine following a death. There are three aspects that must be discovered: The <em>Cause of death</em>, the <em>Mechanism of death</em>, and the <em>Manner of death</em>. Taking them in order:
</p><ol><li> The cause of death is the disease or injury that produces the physiological disruption inside the body resulting in death, for example, a gunshot wound to the chest.
</li><li> The mechanism of death is the physiological derangement that results in the death. Staying with the "gunshot wound to the chest" example, the mechanism of death could be "exsanguination" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0frbs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0frbs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0frbs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">extreme blood loss</span> if the victim bled profusely, or it could be "cardiac failure" if the wound caused the heart to simply stop beating.
</li><li> The manner of death can only be one of six categories: 1) Natural, 2) Accident (or in some countries, "Misadventure"), 3) Suicide, 4) Homicide, 5) Undetermined, 6) Pending.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In this trope, it's almost always either the Cause or the Manner (or both) that's deliberately misstated; when determining if a work contains an example of this be careful not to confuse Cause and Mechanism.
</p><p>This doesn't necessarily include circumstances like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap">a suicide victim shooting themselves in the head twice</a>. As unlikely as it seems, it has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">well-documented</a> that, unfortunately, suicide victims might not succeed with the first shot. With the state they're in after that, they tend to try and finish the job. Indeed, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stanford">one poet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shot himself in the heart three times before dying.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">Never Suicide</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>  that's when someone takes significant steps to disguise a murder as such, instead of just proclaiming it not murder and suggesting you shouldn't disagree.

The doctor instead doubles as one  the same doctor, incidentally, who regularly picks out pretty boys to rape. This means that if anyone who could potentially give proof of the rapes to outside authorities dies in an "accident", he can prevent word from getting out, so long as there are no external wounds on the body.

The <a class="urllink" href="https://derpibooru.org/446450">image<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows Applejack deliberately kicking him into a preexisting crevasse.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar">Medieval: Total War</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport">After-Action Report</a>, the first time the author's faction assassinated another faction's leader, the cause of death was reported as a fall down a flight of stairs, with various outlandish and improbable explanations being given for the more suspicious injuries (such as impaling himself on the spiked banister for the various stab wounds). Saying that a character had "fallen down the stairs" became a euphemism for every assassination performed thereafter.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a>: The False Prophet</em>, the party concludes, after some intimidation from the Avatar, that "Chuckles fell down some stairs. And into a cannon."
</li><li> An inversion occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MakeAWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MakeAWish">Make a Wish</a>". Almost all of the deaths that occur around the mysterious Mr. Black (really Harry on vacation) are indeed accidents. But after a few dozen, the authorities just wink and smile whenever this comes up. One particularly ridiculous example has Minister Fudge accidentally throwing himself down a flight of stairs several times before drinking acid.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/WhoSilencedEllyPatterson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/WhoSilencedEllyPatterson">Who Silenced Elly Patterson</a>", Elly is found dead, and murder is suspected. When the official coroner's report came back, an assistant came forward to the Ontario Provincial Police with suspicious of this trope, given that the autopsy report left off a number of puncture wounds and lacerations, as well as the contents of Elly's stomach, and that he had been pulled off the case in favor of the chief coroner doing the autopsy, and that the chief coroner might have connections to someone in the case with enough power and influence to cover it up. John turned out to be friends with the coroner (they were both in the model railroad club) and he asked for it to be done in a misguided attempt to protect his family. However, in a slight twist on this trope, he's not the murderer.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8496831/2/Reload-of-ARSENAL">Reload of ARSENAL<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> when Fuyutsuki asks what he should tell SEELE about Gendo.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shinji:</strong> Tell them he fell down an elevator shaft. <br/><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong> Onto some bullets? <br/><strong>Shinji:</strong> No, because I pushed him.

It's heavily implied SGC stepped in and explained the man basically brought it on himself.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> story, Yugito has to meet a contact in a brothel. When she gets there, she finds him getting head from her daughter (whom she had given up for adoption at birth) and he remarks that the girl "sucks dick better than her mother". The next scene has Yugito's team agreeing that he got drunk and was mauled by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">bear</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em> story Reclamation, Minaka is killed by Minato after he turns the latter into a human-sekirei hybrid.

A medical officer disproves that by saying that the drug cartel that runs the apartment complex they're in (that the Judges are also working for) was responsible for the murders.

Each one seems improbable at the least, but the most obvious one is Leslie Tiller's death. "She tripped and fell on her own shears." Tiller's death seems to be the only death that's actually been witnessed in some time; the others were either staged for whoever found them, or they simply disappeared altogether.

</li><li> Tom Robinson's escape was likely another example. It's rather difficult to believe a man with one functioning hand could climb a fence at all, much less at a speed that necessitated the use of lethal force to prevent his escape, much less shooting him 17 times in the back to stop him.

Mourning Dove is one of the most powerful and thus most dangerous heroes because she has difficulty controlling her powers enough to <em>not</em> kill people.

The reason Monk is there is because the son of some friend of San Francisco's mayor had died while skydiving but the coroner determined that he had actually <em>drowned</em>. In mid-air. Monk is called in to investigate how such a bizarre murder cover-up might have happened, but it turns out that the coroner is lying, and tampered with the body after death to support his story in case anyone checked. The staging is because he's got an old score to settle with Monk and wants to lure him in with an unusual death. Said corner had, in fact, attempted the same thing <em>several times before</em> with various other bizarre deaths, trying to lure Monk down to Mexico (most notably a wild lion), but this was the first one that the local police didn't just write off as related to the Mexican drug trade.

You might know Temujin better by his adult title, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>. "Dissident" <em>Secret History</em> expressly insists that Temujin and his brother Kasar killed Bekhter. However, Belgutei (Bekhter's brother) apparently remained Temujin's friend and loyal assistant. L.N. Gumilev surmised that if Bekhter spied on their outcast family for Tayichiut's tribe, this would be the reason why Belgutei could justify the killing and why Tayichiut (who threw them all out a few years ago) hunted Temujin.
</li><li> Pretty much the same thing happened with William II and his brother (the soon to be) Henry I of England. A "hunting accident" in the New Forest. To be fair, we don't <em>know</em> he was behind it, but come on, who's kidding?

She was found with a broken neck and her headdress still in place at the bottom of a short flight of stairs. The inquest ruled accident, though at the time most people believed her husband Robert Dudley to be the one who arranged the murder because he wanted to marry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">the queen</a>. The resulting scandal prevented the marriage. There are several theories to the actual cause of her death, ranging from illness (breast cancer caused her bones to be brittle, leading to the accident) and suicide to murder. More convoluted theories include a "make it look like somebody wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>": the queen (or her advisor William Cecil) wanted to prevent the marriage between Dudley and Elizabeth, so they had his wife assassinated and made it transparently look like an accident, knowing that everyone will blame Dudley, making the marriage impossible.

The article even notes that he was the last tenant remaining in a block of flats cleared for redevelopment... but there was nothing suspicious about his chainsaw decapitation.
</li><li> A Russian man was fished out from a river wrapped in sellotape and stuffed in a large zipped up sack. Investigators' version: he was standing on a bridge and unreeling sellotape. With a sudden gush of wind sellotape wrapped itself against the man, he lost his balance and fell over the rail right into the sack which hung on the rail. After the sack sunk to the bottom of the river, the current started dragging it downstream; the slider caught on a snag and fastened itself. Verdict: accident.
</li><li> Once upon a time, in Italy, there was the Piazza Fontana bombing. They found a suspect, the anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli, who, at a certain point, threw himself out of a window screaming "It's Anarchy's end!" So, suicide, isn't it? It could be... if only he had been guilty. The police, asked to explain the circumstances surrounding this case, hastily explained that it wasn't a suicide (like they had said a few days before) but an <em>accident</em>. "Accidental Death of an Anarchist" is based on this case.

</li><li> In August 1987, two teenage boys were run over by a train passing through their hometown in rural Arkansas. The coroner determined that the boys had gotten stoned from smoking nearly two dozen joints and passed out on the tracks. This was disputed by the train conductor, who noted that the boys had been lined up perfectly parallel to each other — something they would have been highly unlikely to do had they been that intoxicated. A second autopsy found that there was barely any marijuana in the boys' systems and that one of them may have <em>already</em> been dead when the train hit them. Meaning that they'd been killed elsewhere and then placed on the track to cover up the crime.
</li><li> Abie "Kid Twist" Reles died after "falling" from a window at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island in 1941. He was in the process of testifying against his bosses at Murder, Inc. — sending several to the electric chair. After he died the police who were "protecting" him said he had fallen while trying to get away (like he had anywhere to go). Accidental death, no doubt about it.

The coroners and their juries didn't always go along with this, however, resulting in the cases being transferred to the military courts of inquiry, which whitewashed these deaths.
</li><li> One night in 1974, nuclear whistleblower <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Silkwood">Karen Silkwood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> left a union meeting to meet a New York Times reporter, carrying a folder full of documents. Later that same night she was found in her car off the side of the road with damage to both the front and the back end that hadn't been there earlier that day, having collided with a culvert with her front end only. The documents she had with her at the union meeting were also missing and there were skid marks on the road and paint chips on the back of her car that suggested someone had rear-ended her. Police verdict? She fell asleep at the wheel and went off into the culvert, suffering fatal injuries. Her life and death were immortalized in the 1983 Oscar-nominated film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silkwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silkwood">Silkwood</a></em>.
</li><li> An odd variant of this trope: reports by police departments, and official news drawing from those reports, usually describe incidents where a cop shot someone in unusually passive voice. For example, "a scuffle ensued, and Officer Brown's gun discharged." In this case, it's less to outright deny the existence of the shooting, and more to make it sound like the shooting was just something that happened, rather than something that may have been instigated by the officer - it could just as easily mean "the perpetrator grabbed Brown and tried to wrestle his gun away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">when it accidentally fired</a>" as "Brown beat the perpetrator while he was handcuffed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop">then shot him in the head</a>." The police themselves term these "Officer-Involved Shootings", which itself downplays the role or culpability the policeman might have in these cases. Generally, this is to try to make them sound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpockSpeak">clinical or unbiased</a>.

McNulty overhears another detective arguing with a coroner who insists that a death was strangulation, when in fact it was an overdose. Rigor mortis had set in with the body in an awkward position, resulting in suspicious marks and fractures from being extricated by the EMTs.

A second post mortem though concluded his death was the result of abdominal haemorrhage from blunt force trauma to the abdomen. A third post mortem found the same. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge for Manslaughter against the officer due to the disagreement between the pathologists' reports. Incidentally, they did decide that a charge of common assault could be brought, but by this time the six month limit in UK law for bringing a common assault charge had passed.
<ul><li> Dr. Patel, the pathologist who carried out the first post mortem examination of Ian Tomlinson seems to have made a habit of this. In 2002, a woman was found locked in a bedroom with a bite mark to her thigh. Dr. Patel's conclusion: she died of natural causes. The owner of the house later went on to kill TWO more women. He also failed to conduct proper tests and reported wrong causes of death in numerous other cases, and was finally suspended from carrying out post mortems for the police or Home Office in July 2009.
</li><li> The actual truth is somewhere in the middle — he <em>did</em> have a very serious undiagnosed heart condition, which could have given him a heart attack basically at any time, though he actually died of cirrhosis and internal bleeding. It was simply total incompetence on Dr. Patel's part that led to the second postmortem.

Unfortunately, in the years 1939-41, the programme was understaffed to minimise personnel costs. This resulted in numerous filing errors as some of the random, falsified dates of death stamped on the urns - containing the victims' cremated remains - contradicted times when the victims' families had seem them alive and well with their own eyes. This prompted a move to greater inaccessibility and secrecy in the period 1942-45 - such mistakes simply could not occur if the victims' families could never see their disabled relatives again, though by 1942 the 'secrecy' of the programme was purely nominal as it had been thoroughly compromised by the earlier mistakes.

His younger brother Herman, who was next in line for the throne, in the same room, and holding a smoking bolter, proclaimed it was suicide. Coincidentally, and following the equally mysterious deaths of Vilhelm's two older brothers, this made Herman the only remaining heir, so the investigators decided to take his word for it rather than risk a succession crisis.

<div class="indent">According to the NCIS documents, each prisoner had fashioned a noose from torn sheets and T-shirts and tied it to the top of his cells eight-foot-high steel-mesh wall. Each prisoner was able somehow to bind his own hands, and, in at least one case, his own feet, then stuff more rags deep down into his own throat. We are then asked to believe that each prisoner, even as he was choking on those rags, climbed up on his washbasin, slipped his head through the noose, tightened it, and leapt from the washbasin to hang until he asphyxiated. The NCIS report also proposes that the three prisoners, who were held in non-adjoining cells, carried out each of these actions almost simultaneously... Although rigor mortis had already set in—indicating that the men had been dead for at least two hours—the NCIS report claims that an unnamed medical officer attempted to resuscitate one of the men, and, in attempting to pry open his jaw, broke his teeth. The fact that at least two of the prisoners also had cloth masks affixed to their faces, presumably to prevent the expulsion of the rags from their mouths, went unremarked by the NCIS, as did the fact that standard operating procedure at Camp Delta required the Navy guards on duty after midnight to conduct a visual search of each cell and detainee every ten minutes.

He was detained in Saipan, CNMI after a fight on an airplane and within two days (during which, someone had made a call to his fiancee from his phone extorting money) he allegedly committed "suicide by hanging with a bedsheet." According to his mother and fiancee, who saw his body, <em>there was no damage to his neck despite his suffering a condition that would have made his bones very easily breakable.</em> Instead, he was brain dead, with a red slash mark to the chest. The death was still, somehow, declared suicide by hanging by the detaining authorities instead of by any sort of autopsy or coroner investigation, and to make matters even worse, his religious adviser, Shinsho, who had been working to steal money from him with his manager, did an end-run around the family to demand the cremation of the body in six days, despite, still, no autopsy having been done to confirm actual cause of death.

</li><li> In early 1978, Robert Boulin was largely poised to be close to replacing Raymond Barre who was widely unpopular, as the next Prime Minister of France. But in early 1979, it comes to a crashing end as the Private Eyes-like French newspaper called "The Chained Duck" began to publish stories about his "bizarre" real estate deals he recently made on the French Riviera! However, one must keep in mind that it was only the tip of the iceberg: it is now universally acknowledged that he somehow knew about a deep scheme built by the Gaullist administration to fund the political campaigns of the two main center-right political parties of France at the time that were in some sort of a ruling coalition under the leadership of the liberal Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and it has been claimed by journalists, politicians, and his grieving family that he was allegedly about to dump it all out in the press as revenge for what he felt as a betrayal by his supposed "esteemed colleagues". Fast forward to the 30th of October, 1979, when his body is found heavily drugged, savagely beaten in the Etang Rompu (whose name is translatable in English as the Ruptured Pond) in the Western suburbs of Paris. According to the Coroner, he drowned. In a body of water that is at most a foot and seven inches deep.

These only grew as more facts about the case emerged:
<ul><li> Epstein was on suicide watch at the time he committed suicide, being supervised by 2 guards and with no obvious means to kill himself. The official story went that both guards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">fell asleep at the same time</a> while the security camera in front of the cell simultaneously "malfunctioned" and therefore they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">failed to notice him hanging himself</a>. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">just so happened</a> to be the first successful suicide at that jail in over thirteen years.
</li><li> Epstein had been placed on suicide watch because of a previous "suicide attempt"... which it later emerged Epstein himself had said was an assassination attempt disguised as such, by a fellow prisoner receiving instructions from a cellphone smuggled into the prison. His cellmate denied this, even having his lawyer subpoena the security footage from that night... only to be told all that footage had mysteriously been deleted.
</li><li> Epstein was bright and optimistic when he was last seen alive, genuinely believing he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">going to be let off again</a>, because he (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">incorrectly</a>) believed that his previous conviction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">prevented him from being found guilty again due to Double Jeopardy</a>.
</li><li> Epstein's autopsy report found that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">neck injuries</a> were more consistent with homicidal strangulation than with suicidal hanging. Specifically, his corpse had a fractured <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone">hyoid bone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is incredibly difficult to break in adult humans outside of being strangled to death (to the point where investigators will often use it as an indicator of homicide).
</li></ul></li><li> Pops up as part of the myriad of conspiracy theories around the death of Princess Diana. James Andanson, the alleged driver of the white Fiat that supposedly ran into Diana's car, causing it to crash, was eventually found dead inside a different car that had been set on fire in a deserted location, after he was shot in the head. This was deemed a suicide.
