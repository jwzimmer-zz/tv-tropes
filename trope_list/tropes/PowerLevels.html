</p><p>Sometimes, power levels are mentioned only in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplemental materials</a> since writers can't allow themselves to be bogged down by that sort of thing in the long run.

</p><p>An advantage of Power Levels is that rating characters or other setting elements in real-world units inevitably falls foul of scientific-minded fans with too much time on their hands.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namers</a> and probable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifiers</a> are probably the ki-based Battle Powers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, known in the West as Power Levels. Just as iconic are the ki-detecting Scouters ("It's over nine thousaaaaand!"). The original Japanese version, however, has Vegeta saying "It's over 8000!" instead:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Nappa:</strong> How much is Kakarot's battle power!?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta:</strong> (<em>while crushing his scouter at the same time</em>) It's over eight thousand!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Nappa:</strong> <strong>OVER EIGHT THOUSAND!?</strong> There must be some kind of mistake! It's a malfunction!
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> This was later brought up in the English dub version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Nappa:</strong> Vegeta! What does the scouter say about his power level!?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta:</strong> (<em>while crushing his scouter at the same time</em>) It's over eight thousand! Raah!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Nappa:</strong> <strong>EIGHT THOUSAND!?</strong> C'mon, that can't be right! It must be broken or something!
</div></li></ul></li><li> Even though <em>Dragon Ball</em> popularized the trope, the entire point was that it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>, thanks to a reliance on the Scouter's numbers and the heroes being able to suppress their Battle Powers. Over the course of the Saiyan and Frieza sagas, nearly every villain will 1) Read a hero's weak Battle Power and reason they aren't worth fighting, 2) Be shocked when they then raise their power to insane heights, 3) Attack anyway whilst claiming the Scouter is on the fritz, then 4) Have their ass handed to them. So pervasive is this among Frieza's men that even <em>King Cold</em> is convinced that Trunks was able to kill his son Frieza thanks to his sword rather than his Battle Power. As a result, several characters criticize their opponents for putting too much stock in the number readings rather than using their instincts and the evidence right in front of them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mnlh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mnlh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mnlh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Case in point: when Goku fights Jeice and Burter, he keeps his power suppressed until the instant he strikes them. This is quick enough that their Scouters don't detect any change, and instead of adjusting, they instead refuse the evidence and angrily attack out of protest and pride, leading to their defeat</span>. Vegeta, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>, quickly catches on, discarding his scouter and telling Nappa to do the same before their battle with the Z-Fighters.
</li><li> Toriyama has stated in numerous interviews and commentaries that Power Levels were never meant to be an accurate representation of a character's abilities. Valor, focus, and purity of heart were supposed to be where someone's true power came from. However, the reason they caught on is that, aside from a few outliers (usually whoever was supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> of the current arc), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">whenever we did hear about Power Levels, the character with the higher number almost invariably won</a>. Also, there was very little reason given in-universe for why one character's feelings pushed them into a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">Traumatic Superpower Awakening</a> and others' didn't. Because of this, a lot of people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">took power levels completely straight</a>.
</li><li> Despite frequent breakage, they kept showing up until well into the Frieza Saga, at which point the numbers start exceeding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballScoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballScoring">6 digits</a>. The highest number given in-series was Frieza, at over a million in his second form; both he and Goku exceeded that level with additional transformations, but all the Scouters on the planet had already been destroyed by that point (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsBlewUpTheScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsBlewUpTheScale">not that they could read them</a>).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1a30v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1a30v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1a30v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One of the Daizenshuu official guide books lists Frieza's maximum power level as 120,000,000, and Super Saiyan Goku's as 150,000,000.</span> Characters could still sense power levels naturally, but their commentary never went beyond, "I've never felt such a strong Ki!"
</li><li> During the Frieza saga, while Super Saiyan Goku and Frieza were fighting, several of Frieza's henchmen on another planet read from a machine that is capable of reading power levels. They note that Frieza's power is at its maximum, and a loyalist boasts about it, but when reading the "other" power level, the machine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale">overloads</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsVolatile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsVolatile">explodes</a>, killing everyone at the base. We never see another machine similar to this, but the fact that Scouters typically explode when a power level is too high suggests that Goku was indeed much stronger than Frieza at this point.
</li><li> Thanks to a portion of the fanbase having a strong interest in power levels, the Daizenshuu and the various Jump publications have been known to occasionally give official numerical power levels for characters that were never measured by Scouters on the show. This includes characters from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series, and characters from after the Scouters became useless. These measurements vary from Goku's mere level of 10 from his very first appearance, to Legendary Super Saiyan Broly's 1,400,000,000 within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBrolyTheLegendarySuperSaiyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBrolyTheLegendarySuperSaiyan">his first movie</a>, and even beyond that to a staggering 2,500,000,000 by Super Gogeta during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZFusionReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZFusionReborn">Fusion Reborn</a></em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mjn0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mjn0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mjn0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, 2.5 billion is the current highest listed power level.</span>
</li><li> Keep in mind that the highest listed level is not necessarily the actual highest power level; Beerus is stated to be the absolute strongest being in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, making his power greater than Super Gogeta's. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> and Beerus himself say that Whis is even more powerful. Finally, Gogeta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> is a Super Saiyan 4, making his power level at least 20 billion (Super Saiyan 3 multiplied by the unknown Super Saiyan 4 multiplier).
</li><li> The disappearance of Scouters post-Frieza is somewhat justified in that only those working for Frieza, none of whom can sense ki without a scouter, use them regularly. And thanks to the Z-Fighters' ability to conceal their ki at will (or to skyrocket their ki in bursts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, especially in the case of Gohan), those readings ended up being painfully mistaken more often than not. The last time we see them is when Frieza shows up on Earth at the beginning of the Androids/Cell Saga. The heroes can all sense ki naturally, so they never needed them..
</li><li> Much later in the series, Goku's Super Saiyan level was counted by Babidi as 3,000 "kilis" as compared to his monster pet Yakon at a relatively measly 800 kilis. Apparently, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dabura</a>, someone with at least 300 kilis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">can easily</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroy the Earth</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardGames">trading card games</a> uses "Power Stages" to determine various things such as attack damage and card cost. These are essentially various Power Levels of the characters' cards. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta, the strongest character in the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> universe, has a maximum Power Stage of over 20 million.
</li><li> <em>Z</em> played with this in the World Martial Arts Tournament just prior to Buu's introduction. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestYourStrengthGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestYourStrengthGame">strength tester</a> was brought out which had the applicants punch it to produce a number. Mr. Satan scored 137 with all his effort. The Z-Fighters just lightly tapped it and all scored around 200 each time (making all the attendants think the tester is malfunctioning). Then Vegeta punched it into oblivion.
</li><li> The overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> for the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise made it so that the power levels introduced in the Saiyan Saga were rapidly inflated to irrelevance by the Frieza Saga. A full power Goku with weighted clothing discarded had a power level of 400 by the start, and "over 9,000" by the conclusion, but was able to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Kaio-ken technique</a> to exponentially increase his power to match an 18,000 power level Vegeta at risk of burnout. Goku entered the Frieza saga after a round of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> with a power level of <em>180,000</em>, and it only got bigger after that once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> transformations became part of the battles. The use of power levels were discarded in part because the villains had more esoteric abilities besides just being really strong, Cell and Majin Buu specifically had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that made them difficult to kill even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">the heroes had reached a new pinnacle</a>. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> tried placing more emphasis on strategy and countering enemy styles and techniques rather than just developing <em>another</em> transformation, that's ultimately still what allows the heroes to win the day against every antagonist.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Espers in Academy City are classified as levels 0 through 5. Level 0 means having a power that is extremely weak or nonexistent - these are basically normal people. Level 1 means something like being able to bend a spoon with one's mind, but noting more, and Level 2 isn't much better. Level 3 is when your power is actually strong enough to be useful in everyday life. Level 4 espers have tactical value as a military force, with some serving as part of law enforcement. Level 5 (of which there are only seven in the entire city) means having both massive raw power and fine-tuned control, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">being capable of defeating an army single-handedly</a>. The gap between Levels 4 and 5 is far greater than that between Levels 4 and 3. Level 6 is still theoretical (though there are attempts made to reach it) and is implied to be divine in nature. Within the seven level 5's in the series, they each hold a numerical rank based on their strength, between 1-7.
</li><li> Both Accelerator (ranked #1 of the Level 5's) and Kakine Teitoku (the #2) possess powers ranked at a god-like level, and are the only ones theoretically able to reach the hypothetical Level 6 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">naturally</span>. Kakine claims that even if he fights all the armies in the world and every esper (minus Accelerator, his only superior) in Academy City at the same time, he can still emerge victorious and unharmed. Given what we've seen him do, <em>there is no reason to assume that this isn't an accurate assessment of his abilities</em>. Likewise, Accelerator claims that it is fully within his power to annihilate all life on Earth or even destroy the planet itself... but he has no interest in doing either one of those things (a destroyed or lifeless planet would be <em>boring</em>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Mikoto Misaka</a>, the third-ranked level 5, once underwent an artificial and unwilling power-up to reach level 6 via being forced to connect to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">MISAKA Network</a> and absorbing the power of nearly 10,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo">of her clones</a> at once, and despite not completing the transformation displayed feats of power that would have easily challenged Kakine and Accelerator at their best, with it being stated she could easily annihilate Academy City with one attack despite her incomplete state</span>.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the Levels are fairly broad, with people of drastically-differing capability often being included in the same Level. For example, Kuroko Shirai and Awaki Musujime are both Level 4 and possess the same teleportation powers, but Awaki is <em>far</em> more powerful than Kuroko, with twice the range and twenty times the haul limit, and she doesn't even have to be in physical contact with whatever she's teleporting like Kuroko does. Per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, she's the strongest Level 4 in the series, and it's implied she'd be the eighth Level 5 if not for some childhood trauma (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">she teleported herself into a wall</a>) keeping her from fully exploiting her ability.
</li><li> This ranking system isn't foolproof either, since the levels and ranking are derived through scientific research. The only reason that Sogiita Gunha (ranked #7 of the Level 5's) is ranked as the lowest is because the nature of his powers cannot be understood through scientific means. He is classified as a gemstone, a person whose powers are manifested naturally, and not through artificial means like most espers.
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically, Touma, the protagonist, is classified as Level 0 because he registers as normal when scanned, even though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Imagine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Breaker</a> easily trumps everyone else's powers, even Accelerator's. This is likely due to the fact that his power doesn't manifest itself in normal circumstances, and only really takes effect when he encounters other espers or magicians. Moreover, his power is not an esper ability - its true nature is currently unknown. That's not getting into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the one or more <em>things</em> that are being sealed by Imagine Breaker</span>.
</li><li> Magicians also register as Level 0 because magic is completely different from psychic powers, so the scientific scanners don't detect anything from them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the lesser-known (but completely insane) anime <em>Ai City</em>, power levels are displayed <em>literally right on the foreheads of the psychics.</em> They all have some sort of sub-dermal implant to let us see how charged up any particular person is. The protagonist, K, is only able to go up to "5" and that basically just gives him enough mind over matter to be really good at kung fu, while his female rival K2 effortlessly goes up to 20-something and can fly. On a couple of occasions when K links his mind with Ai ("I") his power meter goes all the way up to an infinity symbol.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> the Heart Kingdom and Spade Kingdom use a scale for magical power and skill known as Magic Stages, with Stage Zero the strongest and Stage Nine the weakest. Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Arcane Stages</a>, whose powers are unconventional enough to not fit into the scaling. After the six-month timeskip the Clover Kingdom uses it as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, two such systems exists:
<ul><li> The ranking system of the 13 Court Guard Squads - Seatless Soul Reapers-&gt; Seated Officer —&gt; Vice-Captain —-&gt; Captain ——&gt; Captain-General
</li><li> Hollow classes - normal Hollow -&gt; Gillian —&gt; Adjuchas —-&gt; Vasto Lordes
</li><li> Bleach databooks also rated the various strengths of captains, namely Offense, Defense, Mobility, Kidō/Reiatsu, Intelligence, and Physical Strength, max 100 of each, <a class="urllink" href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Databook_Images">many of which are listed on their wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. These are never outright mentioned in the show, and some seem like they're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>
<ul><li> Every main character is given a numerical rank, with #1 being the strongest. And come hell or high water, they will just NOT stop talking about what rank they are. Somewhat justified in that there are a LOT of claymores running around, and it's easier to just approximate off rank. Also provides Claire's status as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>, she's dead last in rank, because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">overspecialized</a> to fight Awakened Beings. She gets better. Her replacement on the other hand, is.. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">less so.</a>
</li><li> How far a warrior taps into her dark yoma powers is also expressed with seemingly precise numbers, even if the scale in this case is a relative percent rather than an absolute measurement of power. According to the veteran number 1 Teresa, when a warrior releases 10% of her power, her eyes go yellow, followed by distortion of the face at 30% and distortion of the body at 50%, with 80% being the point of no return at which the transformation is permanent.
</li></ul></li><li> Akuma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> have extremely strictly-defined Power Levels, going so far as to completely define them by said levels. They can even level up by killing people; it's quite like a game for them. Level Ones are mindless killing machines and all look the same, Level Twos have personalities and very varied appearances, and Level Threes are astronomically stronger than the earlier levels and generally look somewhat like armored knights. Level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">Fours</a> look like twisted cherubs and are powerful enough to take on all of the Generals at once.
</li><li> Compare the Eva pilots with the male lead from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure">Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure</a></em>, whose synchronization rating was <em>negative</em> 200%. Of course, one possible reason for his mecha being able to move at all could be that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's his alternate self from another dimension.</span> Of course considering that every other pilot in the series has a <em>positive</em> rating one has to wonder exactly what a negative one is supposed to be. Or even how either side would have equipment that could measure a negative rating.
</li><li> To an extent, the "World's Greatest Robot" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> treats Horsepower as a kind of power level, but also finds a way to deconstruct the concept even before it became widespread in the shonen genre. The monstruos Pluto, a robot with one milion horsepower has been travelling the world killing the strongest robots under the orders of his creator. Now, Astro knows Pluto is coming after him, so he demands that Prof. Ochanomizu upgrade his output from 100,000 horsepower to 1,000,001 horsepower so he can defeat Pluto. In a twist, Ochanomizu refuses to do that for two reasons: one, Astro was never meant to be a fighting robot, and he refuses to upgrade Astro in a way meant almost exclusively for combat and violence. Two, because he believes that raw power wasn't everything in a fight. So when Astro and Pluto have their final duel, the creator of Pluto reveals he had another super robot built; an even bigger one called Bora, who has two million horsepower. And this new robot destroys Pluto in a tragic scene. But Astro manages to defeat Bora because he's so small, he could pry his way into the giant robot's armor and dismantle him from the inside. A 100,000 horsepower naked robot kid beats a death machine with extreme power by using creativity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta">Gangsta.</a></em> has government dictated Power Levels for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividuals">the Twilight</a>, which are recorded on their dog-tags by letter and number. For example; the most powerful Twilight we've see is ranked <em><strong>A/0</strong></em> with the weakest at <em><strong>D/0</strong></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em> has the Adventurer's Guild ranks, which named after the material used to make an adventurer's ID tag. They are, from the lowest to the highest: Porcelain (newbies), Obsidian, Steel (where they are no longer considered newbies), Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Bronze, Silver, Gold (adventurers who handle matters at a national level) and Platinum (adventurers revered as legendary heroes).
<ul><li> The protagonist, Goblin Slayer, is a Silver-ranked adventurer. According to the novel, Silver-ranked adventurers are trusted veterans who have built up their strength and reputation, and usually assume fthe role of leaders in adventuring parties. Usually, it's only Silver-ranks and below who are actually adventuring out in the field, as anyone ranked Gold and Platinum likely have more important matters to tend to.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em>: For plot related reasons Hikaru's rating drastically underestimates his true skill. In a later match a competitor thinks he has an easy match against a mere 1-dan, and ends up horribly curbstomped.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">Super Crystal</a> rank gets introduced later, attributed to Jewelpets with divine-level magic.

A One-Star Goku Uniform has 10%, Two-Star 20%, and Three-Star 30% (the strongest Goku Uniform a human can ordinarily use). A Kamui is made of 100% Life Fiber and gives the greatest power boost. <em>However</em>, the system just measures the strength of the uniform, <em>not</em> the capability of the wearer or their ability with using the uniform. Mako, for example, is a Two-Star, but due to her raw strength is more powerful than any of the Three-Stars when wearing her uniform.
</li><li> At one point, Mako's "fighting values" are shown on a scanner. She has 0000 in all areas when unequipped, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale">9999</a> when wearing her personal Two-Star Goku Uniform.

</li><li> "Life Fiber tolerance" is not measured in discreet levels, but is thrown around on a couple of occasions to explain Satsuki's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Mako's</span> unusual strength. Someone who can tolerate high levels of Life Fiber contact can use a Kamui Uniform or get the most out of a lesser Goku Uniform.

Also it was discussed with the Five Evil Chojin Gods noting how on earth Kinnikuman of 950,000 can defeat a Perfect Chojin of 50,000,000 who happened to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neptune King</span>. With the God Of Intelligence scanning the Machineguns' Muscle Docking attack defeating the Hell Missionaries; it turns out that Kinnikuman's Burning Inner Strength increased his own Chojin Power up to <em>70,000,000</em> in his attack. This lead to the plot in Scramble Of the Throne Arc to prevent Kinnikuman from becoming king due to his own increasing power that can surpass Chojin Gods.
</li><li> In the Kinnikuman 2012 manga series, it's revealed why are the Devil Chojin and Perfect Large Numbers are fighting against each other. It's for the latter's mission to preserve order to the Chojin World not only because of Suguru's Burning Inner Strength... It's also because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship">Power of Friendship</a> which affected all other Chojin he came contact with regardless of being Devil and Perfect!

Later seasons would use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">mage rankings</a> instead. Presumably this was done because when you <em>start</em> at over a million, the numbers are going to get so high they're more humorous than impressive if you keep using that standard. Interestingly, the mage rankings cover skill as well as power, so a more powerful mage might be ranked lower than a weaker one, if the weaker one was simply better at using their magic.

<ul><li> Spoofed at one point in the manga, where Jack Rakan puts a major villain's power in context with an oddball list that includes: a tank (200), a magic teacher (300), Negi (500) a dragon (650), an Aegis Battleship (1500), the current villain (3000), and the Kyoto Arc demon that Evangeline took out in one hit (8000).

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Chisame:</strong> What an idiotic table... Where do I even begin? What's the basis for these numbers? The teachers are stronger than a tank?
</div><ul><li> The list returns in a later chapter set, again made by Jack Rakan, showing Negi's growth and new ability. Negi is then listed at being 2200 with the right spells in mind. While Rakan himself is placed at 12000. However... due to various in plot activities by all involved... the list might not be all that off. As well as the long list of 'stupid things Rakan not only did but broke various laws of Physics to do'. The fun part is the cat that is listed at half of a point. Negi has a mental image in his depression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">1001 cats ganging up and kicking his ass.</a>

However, Minori explained that an ability user's rank is not absolute measure of their fighting ability.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> measured its pilot-to-Eva <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">synch rates</a> by percentages. This gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">slightly absurd</a> at one point in the series where the rating exceeds 100%, although nobody ever says that it's a percentage of what's possible rather than a wonky way of reporting two statistics that combine to determine synchronization. Of course, the issue of Synchronisation can be simplified by the fact it doesn't equate to "ass kicking levels" but how easily and quickly one can operate an Evangelion. Someone with 100% can move an Eva as easily as one's own body, and someone with less than 20% can't do anything. Past 100% the pilot begins to lose the connection with their own body as they become more and more in tune with the Eva's soul. At 400% synchronization the barriers between their souls break completely and the pilot's body dissolves into a primordial stew; they essentially become part of the Eva. That's probably the least absurd number inflation in the series; success rates for insane and/or suicidal missions typically rank between 0.0000582958% and 1%. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">And they always manage to succeed</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> removes synchronization in favor of the previously less-used "plug depth" to the list of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">technobabble</a> jargon. It can apparently reach negative numbers. From a mechanical viewpoint, this is in fact understandable. The plug is inserted into the Eva's core to allow a connection between the pilot and Eva. Zero depth is not, however, entry into the core but the distance at which further movement into the core will risk "contamination", when feedback from the Eva begins to corrupt the pilot. Negative values are beyond that safety limit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pirates and other outlaws are assigned bounties as a measure of their threat to the World Government and the world at large. Bounties are not strictly a measure of physical power, since what earns a bounty doesn't necessarily correlate to that person's combat ability. For example, individuals who possess knowledge and intelligence deemed dangerous by the World Government will be assigned a high bounty, with one such example being Nico Robin, who was assigned a 79 million belly bounty at the tender age of 8 years old. Despite not being particularly strong<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5xgdw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5xgdw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5xgdw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">she did have a Devil Fruit ability at this time, but she wasn't skilled enough at using it to justify such a high bounty</span>, the World Government put such a high price on her head because she is the only living person in the world that can read and decipher Poneglyphs. This clearly illustrates how bounties are not influenced solely by the individual's martial prowess. However, if the individual <em>is</em> strong, it will only serve to increase their bounty even further. There are just as many exceptions as there are examples, with bounties both over-estimating and under-estimating the real threat of the character.
</li><li> An organization like the Marines will assign military ranks to each of its members, which serve as general indicators of their competence. The higher the rank, the more capable the individual. This is clearly illustrated with the Marine Admirals. Possessing the second highest rank in the Marines, the Admirals are some of the strongest and most fearsome characters in the One Piece world. However, on very rare occasions, a marine's rank is not a good indicator of strength. Like any formal organization, it's possible for any member to voluntarily decline a promotion to a higher rank, despite being qualified. Therefore, it is entirely possible that an otherwise powerful Marine would willingly stay at a lower rank .This is very rare, with the only known example being Monkey D. Garp, who has declined the promotion to Admiral multiple times, choosing to stay as a Vice Admiral. Additionally, current Vice Admiral Smoker was severely under-ranked at the beginning of the series, being a mere Captain. While he has been gaining promotions over the course of the series, he didn't become a Vice Admiral until after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.
</li><li> Additionally, some bad guy groups have group-specific power level-like ways of demonstrating their strength relative to one another, such as CP9's Douriki. The Douriki is pretty much a straight example, which was used during the CP9 arc to rank the members of that storyline's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a>. For a scale comparison, the average soldier has a rating of 10, and anyone above 500 is essentially superhuman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">CP9's strongest member</a>, Rob Lucci, had a rating of 4000 (nearly double that of the next two below him, Kaku and Jyabura who had 2200 and 2180 respectively). Afterward, Douriki was never mentioned again, on account of it being specific to CP9. Amusingly, the dub outright calls it power levels, including a not-so-subtle "Over 9000" reference.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6cymr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6cymr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6cymr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Meanwhile, the boss of CP9, Spandam, is said to have a Douriki of 9, making him weaker than the average mook. However, he has a devil fruit-powered sword, so he is not completely defenseless.</span>
</li><li> Other examples include the numbering system for Gecko Moria's zombies, who were numbered based on what category they fell into, and Baroque Works, whose top six agent pairs were ranked in overall power with 5 being weakest and zero being strongest. Also, there were the percentage-based survival rates for the Upperyard Priests' ordeals during the Skypeia arc.
</li><li> Speaking of Moria, he is a perfect example of why you can't use bounties as an indicator of strength. Of the Warlords <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a></span>, his former bounty was the second highest, right after Doflamingo. Throughout the Paramount War, however, it became explicitly clear that of the Warlords, he was the <em>weakest</em> one. This was due to the fact that during the intervening years between his defeat at the hands of Kaido and the present time, he let himself go and suffered major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of which eventually got him kicked out of the group</span>.

<ul><li> Registered heroes within the Hero Association are measured in classes and ranks. The classes are, from lowest to highest, C, B, A, and S. Within each class, heroes still hold individual numbered ranks. The series subverts this, though: Genos is a genuinely talented S-class hero, while Saitama, who is infinitely more powerful than Genos, is relegated to C-class because of his poor performance on the written portion of his entrance exam.
</li><li> Monsters and villains also have their own power levels that are assigned by the Hero Association, expressed in the form of Disaster Levels, each being signified by an animal/being: Wolf (threats that endanger a small group of people), Tiger (endangers a large number of people), Demon (endangers an entire city, including its infrastructure and inhabitants), Dragon (endangers multiple cities and their infrastructures) and God (endangers the survival of the human race).

At various points, the main character's teams are listed with their stats and abilities, levels included, which gradually do increase as time goes on. However, the levels only indicate their strength; evolution and learning new moves have nothing to do with it.
</li><li> The <em>Pokémon Adventures</em> Pokédex also has the ability to display levels.

A beast with a capture level of 1 requires at least ten professional hunters to bring down. They are <em>not</em> normal measures of physical power; an ingredient with a phenomenally high level is so weak that even the presence of typical badasses would cause it to die instantly- it's high level comes from the fact that getting to it means fighting past a waterfall that typically <em>grinds mountains to dust.</em>

It's worth noting that the Alpha, Beta and Gamma classes were introduced during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> storyline (anyone who didn't fit was rated "Dreg"). As part of a genocidal madman's Darwinist dystopia the classifications made sense, but the writers bled them back into the main timeline as convenient shorthand. Oddly enough there weren't any official Omega mutants in that timeline, although Nate Grey might have warranted that classification.
<ul><li> <strong>Epsilon</strong> Mutants are unfortunate mutants. Epsilon mutants pretty much have no chance of having a regular life in society due to their major flaws like an inhuman appearance or their mutation makes it impossible for them to function normally. If that isn't bad enough Epsilon mutants also only have minor "superpowers" that are next to useless.
</li><li> <strong>Delta</strong> Mutants are like Alpha mutants in that they don't have any significant flaws. The only problem is that Delta mutants don't have powers that match an Alpha mutant, or even a Beta or Gamma mutant. They have a normal human appearance, but their mutagenic powers are weaker or only narrowly applicable, though still controllable.
</li><li> <strong>Gamma</strong> mutants have very powerful mutations, but they have flaws. Unlike the Beta mutants a Gamma mutant's flaw is a major flaw that makes his or her life very hard. Also, while Alpha and Beta mutants can pass as regular looking humans, many Gamma mutants cannot because they have physical deformities.
</li><li> <strong>Beta</strong> Mutants are on the same level as Alpha-level mutants as far as how potent their powers are. But the difference between Beta Mutants and Alpha Mutants is that the Beta Mutants have flaws, albeit very small flaws. They have a normal human appearance (or close to it) and their mutation is powerful, useful, but less controllable but can still lead a normal life with only minor preparation.
</li><li> <strong>Alpha</strong> Mutants are the second most powerful and feared mutants. Alpha mutants have extremely powerful mutant traits without any significant flaws. They have a normal human appearance and their mutation is powerful, useful and controllable (i.e. turn it on and off, direct it at will.)
</li><li> <strong>Omega</strong> Mutants are ones with the most powerful genetic potential of their mutant abilities. Until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen">Jonathan Hickman's X-Men</a></em>, no firm definition had been offered in comics. As a result this classification's qualifications had fallen under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, but some abilities depicted by mutants described as Omega-level include immortality, extreme manipulation of matter and energy, high psionic ability, strong telekinesis, and the potential to exist beyond the boundaries of the known physical universe.
<ul><li> Hickman's <em>House of X</em> #1 defines Omega level mutants as having a super-power that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">has an undefined limit</a>. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> is both a telepath and a telekinetic, but is only considered an Omega level telepath, as her power of telekinesis could hypothetically be surpassed. In fact, Exodus is acknowledged as an Omega level telekinetic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OfficialHandbookOfTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OfficialHandbookOfTheMarvelUniverse">Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe</a></em> tried to give exact, unit-specific measurements of strength and powers ("able to generate temperatures of 28,000 degrees Fahrenheit", "Able bench press ten tons") the newer supplemental material uses a system of levels that are not often consistent with observation and are maddeningly vague— level 3 strength means lifting "somewhere between 800 pounds and 25 tons". The original also went down the fairly mystifying road of saying everyone without strength based powers was average (or below or above) for someone of their age and size, without mentioning that an average obese man without any legs (like Box) can barely lift a coffee can. These days, the Marvel strength ratings are mostly used for comparative purposes. For instance, if an average Asgardian can lift thirty tons and the Thing can lift ninety tons, then, regardless of how much they can actually lift, the Thing is three times stronger than said average Asgardian.
</li><li> DC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent">Who's Who</a></em> tends to take the deliberately vague, but understandable tack of putting everyone's strength levels (or at least the upper-tier powerhouses) as as strong, not as strong, or stronger than Superman.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em>, Apollo is described several times as a "Majestic-Class" superhuman, people in the Wildstorm Universe apparently classifying superhumans by notable figures of about the same power (Mr. Majestic, Wildstorm's Superman analogue, in this case).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em>, where ordinary detectives investigate superpowered crimes, has a rough and not very well defined set of power levels from 1-10 to identify how strong a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> or villain is.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckGodotZapGunForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckGodotZapGunForHire">Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire</a></em> universe, civilizations as well as individuals are assigned 'Power Classes', as an easy way to keep track of who should step carefully around who. This 'Class seems to be determined mostly by technological level, but also by numbers and ability. Humanity, as a whole, is classified as Class 12. The only known Class 1 Power is Lord Thezmothete, who appears to be a sentient tree of some sort (He does, however, seem to have several similarly vegetative underlings). Another notable is The Teleporter, an extra-dimensional alien who exists in a state of continuous transmission, whose capabilities includes transporting entire PLANETS instantaneously across the galaxy - he's a Class 8 Power, all on his lonesome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen">Top 10</a></em> has power levels for psychokinetics. The one the officers have to deal with in issue #6— an escaped mental patient who thinks he's Santa Claus— has Class Two abilities, which allow him to levitate his stolen sleigh and reindeer, take control of Robyn's gadgets, and toss around Smax while making it snow all over the state.

<ul><li> The series has power levels for its magicians, but they count down instead of up. A level 4 magician can do little more than tricks, a level one can do amazing things - but they're all limited to learning incantations or using artifacts; only magicians Beyond Classification have true and instinctive access to magic. It starts at level 7 and goes to 1 then beyond classification, and finally Absolute Zero. A Level 7 can visit the first level of twilight but just barely. They may have specific talents, but are quite weak. A Level 4 can influence large masses of people while a level 1 could rule a large nation or crush it. Anyone of Beyond Classification rating can't be measured accurately because this would require the full use of their power. Such a use is not only forbidden under the Grand Treaty but could also result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly, it's mentioned in one novel that the word "rank" used to be used until the popularity of video games made them adopt "level" instead.
</li><li> A Zero-level mage can, theoretically, do anything and can absorb and use all the magic in the world. Only a few Others throughout history can be stated as being Zero-level. Merlin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">post-Fuaran Kostya</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nadya</span>, and (possibly) Jesus.

Notably, this measurement is not fixed, as a number of lesser Talents have been upgraded to better levels as their powers develop. Consistent with the trope, Primes get consistently stronger as the series evolves, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a> ensuring that later generations greatly surpass their parents.

The book starts with trained warriors and assassins having six to ten of such endowments, but quickly reaches ridiculous proportions with thousands of elite troops having hundred endowments <em>each</em>, and the main antagonist literally having thousands of endowments <em>for each attribute</em>.

Witches and warlocks are described as weakest, with power increasing as the rating system goes up to necromancers, wizards, sorcerers, magicians and enchanters. Enchanters are the strongest of all magic-users, and nine-lived enchanters are even stronger than normal enchanters. There are also side categories such as shamans and mages who are not described in detail. There are some vague differences in how each category of magic-user performs magic, but the stronger classes are able to perform all lower levels of magic.

Somewhat confusingly, the same terms are used to describe both a mage's current rank and their maximum potential, so one could be a Journeyman who aspires to Adept or a Master who is incapable of progressing farther. It is implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> operate on a similar scale but no formal measurements are ever introduced.

<ul><li> Tier One: Intelligent inventions, but within the realm of normal science. Sometimes referred to as "prodigy level." Many Tier One inventions can be replicated, but it's usually not worth the effort. Examples include an unfolding clockwork lunchbox and a real-time single-language translation device.
</li><li> Tier Two: Based on normal science, but just a bit beyond it. These inventions can be replicated by normal scientists with enough effort.

The numbers don't actually have any bearing on what the characters are capable of in the shows and sometimes they're patently absurd, as seen with the memetic example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid">Kamen Rider Poppy</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sim</a> powers) having higher stats than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a>'s final form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Kiwami Arms</a></span> (who is quite literally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade">Kamen Rider Blade</a></em> takes it one step further - the Rider's weapons start with 5000 AP, and cards swiped through them have their AP values subtracted from this. Special cards that <em>add</em> AP appear late into the series.

Some Riders at the absolute pinnacle of the scale don't even have a defined Level at all.
<ul><li> It tried to defy this a little bit by having something called "Level X" which can't be definitively measured and has the capacity to be infinite. Despite being introduced like it was going to be a really big deal, not a lot was done with it, and the main Rider who had such a level, Genm, was demonstrably overpowered by other Riders who <em>did</em> have numerical levels or whose powers were specifically created to outclass everything else in the show at the point they were introduced. One of the epilogue movies got a little silly with it, with Genm creating a form he claimed was "Level Billion", but he was opposed by one of the heroes with a new Level X form.

<ul><li> There's also a quantified measure: Level 1 marks people who will die after exposure (usually because of a pre-existing illness or poor health), Level 2 means they can become Smash but will suffer short-term amnesia if purified, Level 3 is capable of using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Build Driver</a>, and Level 4 can use the more powerful Sclash Driver. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Level 5 can use the Evol Driver, the template from which the Build Driver was created; it's thought to be impossible for a human to achieve, but both Sento and Ryuga manage to get all the way up to Hazard Level 7 by the end of the series, which makes their primary Fullbottles turn metallic and unlocks a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>.

<ul><li> Psykers are ranked by Greek letters in a system known as "The Assignment". The zero point for psychic potential is Rho or Pi, that of a normal human, and go in descending order, with the upwards climbing toward Alpha and descending towards Omega. Going upwards up till Kappa are very minor psychic talents who have many "good luck" occurrences, and Iota and upwards are true psychics who can manifest their abilities. An Epsilon is pretty terrifying, and an Alpha-class can snap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">a titan</a> in half with a gesture. Going into the opposite direction, starting with Omicron and down to Omega is the degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">negative psychic potential</a>, various degrees of an aura that negates psychic abilities.
</li><li> For negative values, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Tau</a> range in Sigma or, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun">Tau</a>. This makes them deaf to telepathy and very hard to corrupt for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos</a>, but otherwise they're affected by psychic abilities normally. Further down the scale are individuals called Blanks, Pariahs, or Untouchables, who are immune to psychic powers and invisible to daemons, and they negate psychic powers in their immediate vicinity. Unfortunately, this also means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">people instinctively don't like them</a>, and it becomes very easy to feel antipathy or hatred for these individuals; and psykers find it painful to terrifying to be in the presence of a Blank. Surprisingly, the only Untouchables are humans. At least one Imperial institution utilizes any Omega that survives to adulthood, which is such strong anti-magic it can harm the souls of people nearby. That Imperial institution rebuilds them into superhuman assassins who specialize in killing psykers.
</li><li> Incidentally, the detachment from reality involved means that most human psykers above Beta level are almost certainly insane by default. Obvious exceptions include The God-Emperor and the Primarchs.
</li><li> Notably, while the Imperium is very interested in collecting and psykers for various reasons. Minor talents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">fed into the Golden Throne</a> to keep some of the most important pieces of Imperial technology functioning. Major talents are rounded up for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">sanctioning</a>: they are used as advisors for Imperial luminaries or for psychic support on the battlefield, though much more often are trained to become an Astrotelepath (Astropath for short). Astropaths are the the only FTL-communication apart from sending a ship somewhere. If psykers are left uncontrolled, they can become a very real security threat. While it's bad enough that psykers could do things like read state secrets from an official's mind, throw around bolts of lightning or fire with impunity, or subvert the will of someone, rogue psykers who forgo sanctioning have a highly increased likelihood of mutation, insanity, or possession, or more catastrophically fall prey to daemons and allow them to materialize. The Imperium generally doesn't even attempt to train Alpha levels - the usual response is a bullet in the head.
</li><li> And there are some that don't actually fit in this - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the scale is extended</a> to Alpha-plus and Omega-Minus for those individuals for whom the 24 greek letters do not suffice. Older canon even covers higher plus/minus levels that double back through the alphabet, where you're really more talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> than anything else. Or the Emperor.
<ul><li> It should be noted however, that the scale is only really built for human psykers.

</li></ul></li><li> It should also go without saying that being a tabletop game, models are also given a 'point' cost to field, with more powerful models costing more. In fact, the tabletop simplifies the matter by "mastery levels", the lowest ranking psykers have Mastery Level 1, while the higher psykers have up to Mastery Level 3, then comes the most powerful psykers, Eldrad Ulthran, Ahriman, and Kairos Fateweaver, who have Mastery Level 4. Magnus, the most powerful known psychic to walk the Galaxy short of the Emperor, has both Mastery Level 5 and some unique buffs which makes him more powerful than what his mastery level alone would imply.

All offensive and defensive powers must be at or under their character's PL. The only exception is that it is allowable to trade off on opposing traits like accuracy versus damage, or defense versus toughness. Powers like non-offensive teleportation and telekinesis lack such bounds except in house rulings. Like D&amp;D, it's rare for this to come up in-character, however.
</li><li> Your base Essence stat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> kinda represents this in that a higher rank unlocks more powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">Charms</a>... except that the actual charms a character has means a lot more in terms of comparing power levels within Exalt types, and that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight">Super Weight</a> between the different types means more than if their Essence stat matches. Terrestrials, for example, tend to be significantly weaker than Solars or Abyssals, and Alchemicals veer up and down wildly depending on whether they've had time to optimise their Charm loadouts against you or not. It is, however, played straight in-setting in Yu-Shan, where a being's status is largely determined by their Essence rating, and elder Sidereals with an Essence of 10 socially outrank anyone except the Incarna.

Across the board, the power stat allows for increased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> storage and expenditure, as well as an increased resistance against mind-affecting supernatural powers.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>, most powers have defined levels, at least they're defined by the powers testing guys. And the authors even wrote a bunch of them up on the website. Power levels are more for the purposes of classification, and are known to be really deceptive, as they're very much descriptive, rather than proscriptive. Still, they're all WAY below Marvel or DC levels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, there's a government categorization system that sorts parahumans by ability (I.e. minion powers are Master, shapeshifters are Changer, and so on) and ranks them on a scale of 1 to an undefined upper limit, although generally 12 is roughly the top. The scale system is only intended to be a simple shorthand, however, and raw power isn't even the prime factor in the numerical rating. The incredibly wide range of powers in the world means that many powers don't fit neatly into one category, and a parahuman working out more effective ways of using their powers could significantly change their ratings overnight. To a certain extent, even the parahuman's non-parahuman talents come into play— Leet and Uber would likely have gotten higher ranks if they were clever enough to exploit their powers to their fullest extent. The looseness of the rankings is further shown when the PRT decides they are done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">underestimating Skitter</a>, and their boss declares that she be given a +2 ranking in <em>every single category of power</em>, including those she has never displayed any superpower in (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Tinker</a>), just to hammer the point home.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DouluoDalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DouluoDalo">Douluo Dalo</a></em> people have a measurable rank that represent the power they should have and how far they have trained, this number's not absolute for comparison, but gives a good measurement of their powers and also limits their possible abilities. Each 10 ranks the person has to go out and hunt a magical beast to be able to continue their training.
</li><li> In the webnovel Brennus, superhumans are given a ranking between 1 and 13, with 1 being the level of perhaps a person with 20% more strength than the average human, while 13 is the level of The God-King of Mars, who's words can change the fundamental laws of the universe. However, the Brennus universe has also been noted using the standard F, D, C, B, A and S threat level scale.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a> classifies anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena with an "object class". In a subversion of the trope, an object class does not represent how <em>dangerous</em> an SCP is, but rather, how <em>difficult it is to contain</em>. In rough order, object classes for SCPs that have not been neutralized include "Safe" (easily contained and unlikely to break free), "Euclid" (moderate difficulty in containment), "Keter" (very difficult to contain and liable to escape), and "Thaumiel" (an SCP that is specifically used to contain other SCPs). As a rule of thumb, any SCP that exhibits sentience is classified as at least Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictable nature of beings capable of independent thought and action.

Let's Be Heroes</a></em>: In K.O.'s world, heroes and villains have a "Power Level" that can be viewed on their POW Card (good guys have a positive level, while bad guys have a negative level). They seem to be based on a mixture of strength, skill, and experience, and heroes can "level up" with training. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking">not a particularly hard and fast level of strength</a>, and near the end of the series the new CEO of POW Cards Industries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">admits that power levels are kinda arbitrary</a>.

Rainbow Dash, who is the only pony known to be able to break the sound barrier, comes in at an impressive 16.5 Wing Power, but Fluttershy, who is not a strong flyer, is individually measured no higher than 2.3. Despite the emphasis on training to raise one's individual power level, it takes a minimum of eight hundred cumulative Wing Power to create a tornado large enough to move water from the ground to the cloud factories in the sky, so doing work and breaking records is largely based on the number of pegasi involved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>, ghosts have "levels" which are measured by PKE meters; for anything above level 9, the proton packs and traps are totally ineffective, while level 1 is impossibly low.
