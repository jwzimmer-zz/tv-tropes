</p><p>Despite always being desperate for cash, food or other supplies, some people never seem to actually run out. They might always be desperate for money, but somehow manage to live in the same house for the duration of their show, never getting kicked out once.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> crew spend every single episode complaining about their lack of food, fuel and money - to the point where they end up eating dog food and ages-old rations. Despite usually failing to capture a bounty in almost every episode, they never actually starve — although one episode does show them not only out of both money and food but out of fuel as well, a situation which gets remedied mostly by accident. And when they actually do get a bounty head, either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">some circumstance will conspire to ensure that they don't get anything for it</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour">the repair, medical and other bills from the massive destruction they caused going after bounties will cancel out whatever money they made</a>. And, on top of it all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Faye</a> is shown to be a gambler and an occasional thief.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonGirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonGirlNextDoor">The Demon Girl Next Door</a></em>, as a result of a curse put on the Yoshida household, they have to subsist on 40,000 yen a month. On the day Yuko's mother revealed their demonic origins to her daughters, they had run out of their rice supply for the month, and it is implied they intended to subsist on <em>miso soup</em> for the rest of the month. This is also why Yuko lacks knowledge on common grocery items and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWithTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWithTech">Hopeless with Tech</a>.
</li><li> Dante from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries">Devil May Cry: The Animated Series</a></em> also has problems staying in money because of the collateral damage he racks up during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">Demon Slaying</a> jobs. It doesn't help that he's also in debt to various people, or that Trish and Lady like to stick him with their shopping bills.
</li><li> The protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>. Shinichiro Wantanabe likes his characters broke.
</li><li> Continued with the crew in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em>. Occasionally they <em>do</em> get money, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> prevents them from keeping it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>: The crew sinks deeper and deeper in debt from the costs of operating, repairing, and re-arming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">the XGP</a>. Unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, this never really cuts into their budget for food, because they have a financier who's sweet on Gene and will offer them a job any time they're genuinely strapped. Though they are seen eating better after getting a payout or when the bill is being footed by someone else. In those instances they tend to have large seafood feasts, while in other episodes they're generally seen eating cheaply made stew or eggs and toast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> the title characters are always starving and are frequently denied credit at the Honky Tonk. That still doesn't stop them from being incredibly powerful fighters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>, Ataru's parents are always struggling to make ends meet, even though Ataru's "wife" is a princess from a highly advanced alien planet (at one point, she casually pays an intergalactic taxi fare which amounts to the value of all the oil on planet Earth).
<ul><li> Ataru's dad regularly worries about how many more payments he needs to make on the house. Not once does the word "foreclosure" ever come up, and at the end of the series he and his family still have their home (despite it being completely destroyed several times).
</li></ul></li><li> Lucy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> is always worrying about making the month's rent, despite being the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in the country (she ran away from home) and taking on the most high-paying jobs available (most of the reward money gets swallowed up by the bills for her teammates' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior">property damage</a>, or her team refuses the reward for one reason or another).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsNewCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsNewCentury">Zoids: New Century</a></em>, the protagonists have a huge mobile base shaped like a giant robot snail, from which they launch their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, but have trouble scraping together money for repairs. Most of the blame probably lies with Leena and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">attack spamming</a> tactics. Paying for all of the rounds in just one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">Weasel Unit Total Assault</a> must be <em>ridiculously</em> expensive. This is pretty much said outright in one episode, where an off-the-books scuffle leads to the team withdrawing from the next day's tournament, as replacing enough ammo for Leena to compete with the team would put them below the break-even point even if they got top prize. Considering that even the <em>design</em> of the thing was ludicrous (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> to the point where Bit was wondering why she didn't stick a few nuclear missiles on it), all those weapons were probaby really expensive, too.
<ul><li> Though their money woes become a bit odd as the show goes on because they keep winning Backdraft battles which frequently multiply the reward money to compensate for their overly destructive nature. If they're still barely making a profit after that one has to wonder how they could stay afloat at all otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> A regular theme in the manga series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LucuLucu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LucuLucu">Lucu Lucu</a></em> is that the characters are genuinely, and realistically living in poverty for most of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube">Hell Teacher Nube</a></em>: Meisuke "Nube-sensei" Nueno often doesn't have enough money even to eat properly, as he is often seen eating a single ramen for one (or two) days. He was outright haunted by the actual God of Poverty once.
<ul><li> It's explained that he <em>could</em> make more riches, but that would involve leaving his work post as a teacher and/or doing either illegal or shady things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">which he refuses out of principles</a>. As <em>much</em>, he'll use once or twice his demon hand to cheat at the Pachinko games, where his students can't see him.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by the principal in one episode, when he asked Nube where all his salary went.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Yusuke and his mother Atsuko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. In fact, it's not clear how they pay for the small apartment they live in, since neither of them seems to have a job. The only real hint is an offhanded joke in the seventh chapter that seems to imply that Atsuko moonlights as a prostitute, and late in the manga Yusuke's father briefly appears, suggesting he might help.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>, various individuals fit this trope since the manga was poking fun at the recession Japan was going through. But the heroines in particular are always starving since they cannot hold down a temp job. However, their "emergency food ration" survives to the last episode.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This trend is broken in the manga after Hyatt and Elgala become executives of ILL (Il Palazzo's current and most successful world conquest vehicle). Menchi (the aforementioned ration) gains quite a bit of weight because of this.</span>
<ul><li> This development led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brief poverty for Dr. Kabapu and his employees as Il Palazzo revealed his embezzlement and general corruption, but he bounced right back since his secretary Momochi managed to hide most of the money even from himself.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Miyako in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em> fits in this trope. She is generally low on cash, to the level that in one strip, since she didn't even have the 300 yen for lunch, she decided to <em>drink water</em> instead.
<ul><li> This is actually a depressing example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>—some people fill their bellies with water when they don't have anything to eat. Of course, this being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Hidamari</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCute">Sketch</a></em>, it's more funny and cute than it is sad, especially when Yuno offers to split her lunch, despite losing some of the bread she brought as charcoal erasers to Miyako's hunger.
</li></ul></li><li> Lack of funds is a main theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari">Binbou Shimai Monogatari</a></em>—no surprise, since the title translates as "the story of the poor sisters".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocket">Team Rocket</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> are <em>constantly</em> hungry, to the point that they'll offer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">temporary loyalty</a> to anyone who'll feed them, even Ash and the gang, yet they never seem to starve. They also very often complain of having no money. This is because they always blow their salary on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> in their schemes to steal Pokemon.
<ul><li> On occasion, they have taken regular jobs. But only until they have enough money to pull off whatever scheme they've been concocting.
</li><li> In one episode they even comment that they never keep any cash more than 24 hours.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, Maylene, the Veilstone Gym Leader, is initially jealous of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou">Platinum's</a> wealth and is usually shown to be hungry. At the battle at Mt. Coronet, she outright states that she is poor. This is probably due to the fact that she has a deadbeat dad who does nothing but play slots at the Game Corner all day, much to her chagrin.
</li><li> The Makino family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em>. They started out as just comparatively poor, which made sense given that 99.5% of the main cast were ridiculously wealthy, but by the end of the series they were living in a shack, drying seaweed for money.
</li><li> Train's group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> are almost always strapped for money, constantly having to take on new sweeps despite managing to catch several bounties worth millions. Apparently their debt tends to be caused by Train breaking things or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eating too much</a>.
</li><li> Ryo-san, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kochikame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kochikame">Kochikame</a></em>, spends all of his money on video games, models, and gambling and is in debt to most of Katsushika (in stark contrast to his two companions at the police station who each have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">more money than God</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is one of Ukraine's biggest woes (other than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> siblings' screw-ups, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">which she often has to fix</a>).
</li><li> Greece. In the CD drama <em>Hetalia Phantasia</em>, he says he suffers from trade deficit and can't play online games because of that.

All he wears is an oversized, shabby and patchy coat, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear">apparently can't even afford underwear</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Claire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden">Red Garden</a></em> has trouble with her job and rent, even to the point of her phone line and gas getting shut off, but still manages to make it through.
</li><li> Most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</a></em> have a problem with this, being university students fresh out of a Buddhist college with no real skills apart from the ones that come in handy in corpse-collecting.
</li><li> Kobato from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato">Kobato.</a></em> seems to only possess her clothing, her <em>futon</em> and the magical bottle where she stores the suffering of others.
</li><li> Abel Nightroad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em> generally gets very little to eat, to the point of sometimes subsisting on 13 scoops of sugar in his tea. Justified by the fact that he's a priest and has taken a vow of poverty.
</li><li> Apparently there is no need for money in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> universe as you never see the main characters working, and tend to spend all their money at the casino. This is very obvious in one episode when they lose ALL their money at the casino and are complaining about being broke while sitting in a first class cabin on a train before going to the food cart for lunch.
<ul><li> Of course, they bought those train tickets before losing their money at the casino. And Elie always wins said money back at every casino (she never even loses once in the manga). There are a couple chapters dedicated to looking for someone to sponsor them, or ways to raise funds. And on occasion you'll catch them being self-sufficient.
</li></ul></li><li> A major point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NieaUnder7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NieaUnder7">Niea_7</a></em> is that Mayuko's troublesome finances get strained even more by Niea's freeloading.
</li><li> Akihisa Yoshii, the lead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em>, lives in a state of constant financial woe. It's noted that he frequently prioritizes new video games over his food budget, so it's mostly self-inflicted. He has to eat salt and sugar water for energy, has no hot water, and divides up his meals into 1/64ths so he can survive. His situation improves somewhat after his big sister moves in, but not by much.
</li><li> The basic premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers">Nerima Daikon Brothers</a></em> is that the eponymous band needs money to build their concert dome, so of course they're always broke to keep the plot going. Ichiro <em>is</em> the most popular host at a host club and does make a good bit of money but saves most of it for the concert dome, Mako is extremely materialistic and tends to blow whatever money she gets, and Hideki is usually the one she <em>gets</em> money from in the first place.
</li><li> Despite most of the cast being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Ojou</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>'s Hayate Ayasaki and Yukiji Katsura are pressed to the limits of their pocketbooks continually. Hayate for his selfless giving to his harem, Yukiji for her love of drinking.
</li><li> The manga series <em>Dai-Tokyo Binbo Sekatsu Manyaru</em> ("Tokyo Poverty Daily Life Manual") revolves around a laid-back main character, Kosuke, who has deliberately chosen to adopt a life of poverty. It's easier that way: you don't need to take care as much stuff, you have less responsibilities, and you can focus on the things that matter like friends and spiritual wholeness. (This could in some ways be a kind of manga manifesto for the freecycle culture.)
</li><li> Kanba, Shoma and Himari Takakura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum">Mawaru-Penguindrum</a></em> live in a run-down house with their penguins and are almost always short of cash. Episode 5 has Kanba discussing matters related to their lack of money with their uncle Ikebe, who is worried about their well-being and how their parents have been gone already for a while; he tells Kanba that he should sell the house and move with his siblings to a smaller apartment, but Kanba refuses to do so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the end of the episode, however, Kanba has somehow gotten a hold on enough money for the month. This is very important, plot-wise, as we later learn that he's in cahoots with a certain terrorist cell...</span>

</li><li> The Yorozuya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> are motivated to take all sorts of weird jobs to pay the rent and afford food. Despite constant warnings, they are never evicted.

They are almost always in the red, and considering the size of the army and their composition, it's miraculous he can actually feed them and maintain their gear. Still no victory feasts, though.

The end credits song even has them singing about how poor they are.
<ul><li> Said ending song is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">repeatedly cut off</a> during the opening few episodes because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">Hinata couldn't pay the production company to finish it.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> has Shizuo Heiwajima, who has been fired from several jobs as a result of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and (unfortunately) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a>. His current job has more toleration for his destructive tendencies, simply taking monetary compensation by deducting his pay (which is presumably a lot considering Shizuo gets angry so easily), yet Shizuo doesn't really seem strapped for cash at any rate. He doesn't even mind the deductions from his pay — if anything, he's surprised that he's paid at all.
</li><li> The only main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> with a stable wage is Genma — a janitor. Soun's family lives off occasionally renting their dojo for various parties, festivals and such. Many episodes focus either on being hired to vanquish some monster — and being paid with food. Or just on an opportunity for some free food. Or not having enough food to last till tomorrow. And then there's the constant need to repair the broken walls — Saotomes had to abandon Nodoka's house and move back to Tendo Dojo, because they could not afford fixing both.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami">Noragami</a></em>, Yato lives like this, because all he asks for the various odd-jobs he does is 5 yen, and he isn't always in high demand. He's also not a very well-known god, so he doesn't have his own shrine or temple, and he doesn't have a house, either.

</li><li> Ryo Saeba and Kaori Makimura in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> are this in spite of their job as sweepers (that is, they do bodyguard works, investigations both legal and illegal, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">assassinations, provided the committent has a good reason</a>) due a combination of them spending a lot in weapons and munitions, Ryo sometimes having more or less justified <em>enormous</em> expenses (he once surprised Kaori by just spending <em>100 million yen</em> in a week by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">giving it to a rehabiliation clinic for drug users after bringing there a dozen addicts in dire need of help</span> without telling her), and enemy attacks on their home and their own shenaningans causing great damage to their place and apparently scaring away the people that were renting the other apartments of their building in the first chapters.
</li><li> Misaki Ayuzawa and her family from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama">Maid-Sama!</a></em> resort to unconventional methods in order to cope with poverty: like her working in a maid cafe, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">her sister</a> constantly winning the lottery.
</li><li> Glenn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AkashicRecordsOfBastardMagicInstructor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AkashicRecordsOfBastardMagicInstructor">Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor</a></em>. Despite receiving a decent salary as a magic teacher and not having to pay rent due to living in his foster parent's house, he still routinely finds himself short on money to even buy food (said foster parent refuses to help him on any other expenses). This is his own fault as he wastes money on things like gambling.
</li><li> Shigure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoMichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoMichi">Kemono Michi</a></em> oftentimes complains about how often Genzo's pet shop is in the red, thanks to Genzo's luxurious pampering of his increasingly large menagerie of animals, Hanako's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">bottomless stomach</a>, and Carmilla being utterly useless on her best days. In spite of this, the shop is never repossesed, they are never forced to release any animals back into the wild, and they almost always find some way to get back in the black or settle their most pertinent debts and afford food for themselves and the animals. It should be noted that while Genzo brags about how high quality their pet food is, Shigure often complains about consuming soup that's just heated salt water.
</li><li> Three of the schools of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> exhibit this, as a shout out to the resource situation of the countries they're taking after in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>:
<ul><li> Anzio High School is this, though it's less because they're a parody of Fascist Italy with its resource scarcity and industrial paucity and more because they're a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eaters</a>. They have food stalls and parties all the time (like after every sensha-do match, regardless of who wins) and it's shown that they could actually buy some new equipment if they scaled back their considerable food budget a bit.
</li><li> Jatkosota High School, in a parallel to Finland's lack of a dedicated tank program and reliance on captured enemy equipment. This is shown in series by having them regularly plunder the other schools for equipment and supplies (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a> in the film shows that they stole a KV-1 from Pravda and they apparently left the match as soon as their tank got knocked out to loot the University Team's stuff) and, as a result, have a tank force as mixed as Oarai's.
</li><li> Chi-Ha-Tan Academy, hearkening to Imperial Japan's extreme resource shortage. Supplemental materials show that they strictly ration everything they have to the extent that, the girls of Jatkosota refuse to steal from them (the first time around, at least). In fact, they left their wheelbarrow behind because they really felt sorry for the IJA-themed school.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JahySamaWontBeDiscouraged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JahySamaWontBeDiscouraged">Jahy-Sama Won't be Discouraged!</a></em> used to be the second-in-command of the Demon Realm; powerful, surrounded by luxuries and minions catering to her every whims. Now she's reduced to living in an old apartment complex, eats meager meals and take part time jobs just to survive while she tries to restore the Demon Realm.

<ul><li> Part of the charm of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlanFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlanFord">Alan Ford</a></em>: as a parody of the spy fiction genre, the T.N.T. Group is costantly penniless and forced to live in a delapidated flower shop, using straw bales as mattresses and being forced to sussist on meager soups and the occasional sandwich/hamburger/hotdog. Apparently is because the leader and founder, the Number One, is an extremely stingy old man, but also because, as he himself points out some times, the agents themselves aren't accustomed to being rich, and when they do receive some money as a reward they end up wasting it in record time. The trope is eventually broken after the apparent disappearence of the T.N.T. Group and Alan opening an investigation agency with his girlfriend and eventually wife Minuette Macon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is the premier example of this. Despite being a super genius inventor who created a revolutionary new super strong bio-degradable adhesive, friends with several billionaires, married to a model/actress, and being a member of the world's greatest superhero team (the Avengers), he still seems to be utterly broke in most storylines, to the point where he just put up with a dislocated shoulder until it healed to avoid paying the medical bills. Many fans feared that the fallout of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> would put him <em>back</em> into this, but so far it seems that he's doing quite well as co-owner of Parker Industries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it's played completely straight again when he has to destroy Parker Industries to keep Hydra from getting its hands on it.</span>

His offers are respectively: beer, birdseed (sarcastically), and in Peter's case, money. Peter is then shown dramatically hugging Tony while crying "Thank God!"
</li></ul></li><li> This is part of José Carioca's character in his Brazilian comic series. He's avoided paying for things so much, his debt collectors have formed their own group known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Anacozeca">A.N.A.C.O.Z.E.C.A.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> He is not above <a class="urllink" href="http://outducks.org/webusers/webusers/2006/06/br_zc20_0001f_001.jpg">bathing in a public fountain, or pulling a dine and dash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> is an even older example than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a>. Somehow, circumstances always conspire to keep him from any riches he may find in the course of the stories.
<ul><li> A running joke, at least in Italian stories, is that Donald puts everything on the tab, and now has an enormous debt to every grocer, vendor, repairman, etc. in Duckburg. Paying off all his debt seems to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>, and his creditors can get downright brutal. Yet he's hardly ever evicted from his big suburbia house... Because his landlord is Scrooge. In lieu of rent, Donald does any task Scrooge asks of him, from life-threatening adventures to polishing every coin in the money bin.
<ul><li> Italian stories also provide justifications on just why his creditors are still willing to do business with him and haven't sued him off everything he owns: on one hand, Donald is known to be friends with the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">Unscrupulous Hero</a> Paperinik (alias <em>himself</em>), so they don't <em>usually</em> cross certain lines out of fear of him coming after them (as it actually happened in some stories, as Donald <em>does</em> use his alter ego to settle scores, and being forced to sign contracts saying he'll pay them tenfold once he inherits from Scrooge or them outright laying siege to his house and devastating his garden is enough for him to grab the costume); on the other hand, whenever Donald brings home some riches he <em>immediately</em> pays off his tab (that's a frequent reason for him not keeping his riches), so they know they <em>will</em> get the money... Someday.

<ul><li> Harry Dresden is always broke in the first several books. Magic doesn't pay well. Even later on, when he gets a job with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wardens</span> that makes a decent amount of money, he stays in the same grotty little apartment and keeps the same run-down car - both because he's still far from rich, and because magic's tendency to mess with technology means that he doesn't get along too well with <em>electricity</em> (e.g.: icebox rather than freezer) much less anything more complex. (And because his landlady is remarkably understanding about things like zombies trying to break down his doors, and because Harry's not that big on change.)
<ul><li> It's never outright stated, but it seems that Harry plows down a pretty big chunk of his disposable income into paraphernalia for his magical research. For example, he has significant amounts of uranium dust and rhino horn lying around his lab (neither of which is exactly cheap, even if depleted uranium is legal and pretty harmless), paid someone to forge a ten-feet-in-diameter circle of copper and laid it into his lab floor (unless he did it himself, but that seems unlikely), is always improving his focus items (over the course of fifteen books, he's gone from one kinetic battery ring to <em>seventy-seven</em> kinetic batteries integrated into his staff), and at one point constructed an <em>accurate scale model of Chicago</em> to make it easier to track things.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Skin Game</em>, Harry takes part in a heist, where he is promised two million dollars upon completion, plus whatever he can grab from the vault and stuff in a bag (which is estimated to be about twenty million, if he's smart and grabs gems). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't get paid or even get a bag, but one of the other survivors was smart enough to fill her backpack with diamonds.

They aren't paid for their work, but get free housing, and by law all merchants are supposed to give them whatever they want when they ask for it. On a social level, this isn't nearly as good as it sounds when everyone resents you for walking into their bar and getting free drinks.

The close narration makes it possible to follow exactly how much money he has at any point in time.

His money problems are mostly resolved after he returns from his trip in <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em>.

<ul><li> The Weasley family, whose wands, books and robes have been handed down through seven children in order to save money. Despite this, the Weasleys have no problem letting Harry and Hermione (both well-off) stay with them for all or part of the summer.

This could be simply because the Weasleys feel that a family trip is more important than material possessions, though; and it was the first time they'd seen Bill, who worked there as a curse-breaker, in some time.
<ul><li> The Weasleys' situation never seems to improve, even after the five oldest children move out.

At one point, Mal actually manages to sell something without shenanigans going down... and then you see the laser sight on his buyer's forehead...
<ul><li> The tabletop game based on the series actually added a negative character trait that enabled players to roleplay this; taking it meant that there was something like a one-in-four chance that the character would lose <em>all</em> the money they were supposed to be getting paid at the end of a quest. It was named after Mal's catchphrase, "It Never Runs Smooth".
</li><li> There were a few episodes following a heist where they stole a few hundred pounds of pharmaceuticals in which they could afford fresh fruit. But they spent it all, quite a bit of it on ransom in the episode mentioned above.

They knock over a bank in the climax of the second season, however, which eases most (but not all) of their money troubles.
</li><li> Not quite as severe day to day (but with a worse overall situation given the population difference) was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>, which also included several episodes attempting to get enough food, water and fuel to keep surviving. The ships were constantly getting more damaged and even the clothes getting worn out, and even when they had enough supplies to get by it was still eking out a miserable existence in rooms the size of closets (if you were lucky enough to get a room — very few did even among the senior crew, Admiral Adama being a notable exception) with nothing much to relieve the crushing monotony and basic nature of their lives, eating algae processed muck as a staple. It comes as no surprise they always made sure they had plenty of booze around. Much like the students' example in the trope explanation.
<ul><li> This was also the case, though less emphasized, in the original; at least two episodes revolved entirely around getting new seed, or supplies of fuel, and a segment of "War of the Gods" showed just how low living standards are for most of the Fleet's population.

There are several episodes throughout the show that emphasize how much they are struggling to make money and support their four dysfunctional children. The fifth and oldest goes through this as well, but subverted in that he constantly travels around trying to make ends meet. Justified as neither Hal or Lois earn very much (he's an average blue-collar office worker, and she works in a convenience store) and providing for 4 (then 5) children and sending Francis to military school costs a lot.
<ul><li> The parents frequently engaged in actively destructive behavior that kept them in poverty.

</li><li> An especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example of this trope is found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, seeing as the 2nd edition of the game, as it got more and more supplements, got exact prices on every damn expensive thing the creators could think of. The most expensive object in the game would be a best craftsmanship galleon, which following game rules costs a stunning 120 THOUSAND gold crowns in a game where players have much better odds scavenging their equipment than working to make enough money to actually afford pistols or plate armour - both of which at common craftsmanship cost almost 1/500 of the galleon. Yeah... it's basically just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to players.
<ul><li> Fourth edition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforces this trope</a>: When characters return from an adventure, they're first allowed to sell off any loot they found and buy whatever items they can get with the money. Next, they can perform the 'banking' endeavour to stash away whatever is left (be it in an actual bank or by burying it, leaving it with a trusted friend, or similar). Any money not spent or banked is automatically lost before the start of the next adventure, with the players expected to come up with a roleplaying reason for how it was spent (paying down debts your debts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Bruno Ballcrusher</a>, sent back to the family, wasted on wine, women and amateur theatre, etc). If given a week, characters are allowed to make skill rolls to earn money using their class skill, but for the most part it's little more than a cover for living expenses unless you're of a <em>very</em> high social status. This pretty much ensures that financial incentives will be able to drag the players back on the road.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Reign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Reign">Reign</a></em> encourages players to do this to themselves by offering bonus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> for squandering your wealth, in the style of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FafhrdAndTheGrayMouser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FafhrdAndTheGrayMouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> stories mentioned above. The effect is somewhat diminished once your Company has much of any Treasure score (which might be right at the start) and you can easily meet all your personal needs out of the petty cash, though. Then again, Game Masters are advised to keep note of that practice and penalize the Treasure score if done too much, meaning you could potentially set a whole town, business, or kingdom into this trope through overindulgence in frivolities.

<ul><li> Reimu Hakurei is, due to a lack of donations, portrayed like this in most fan works. Some doujins show her <a class="urllink" href="http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/238608/">eating grass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and either <a class="urllink" href="http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/19156/">pestering for or extorting donations from other characters.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> If it wasn't for the Youkai that show up at her shrine, she could probably live a relatively comfortable life if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">she actually tried being a better</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Miko</a> for the other humans.
</li><li> This is actually zig-zagged in canon, though. On one hand, she still doesn't get donations, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouIbarakasenWildAndHornedHermit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouIbarakasenWildAndHornedHermit">Touhou Ibarakasen ~ Wild and Horned Hermit</a></em> demonstrates that she gets herself into a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme">get-rich-quick schemes</a> and the plot of one chapter kicks off when she almost dies from food poisoning after eating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">mouldy, fuzzy riceball</a>. On the other hand, she is seldom shown to lack for anything she wants or needs, and she's only gone as far as unsubtly hinting at people to donate once or twice. Supposedly she gets some income from youkai hunting and incident resolution. It's also demonstrated that if Reimu actually put in the effort, she could easily get out of and stay out of poverty. For the most part, she seems to only have just enough to manage, but no more, and is generally fine with that.
<ul><li> Reimu's main problem is that it appears to others that she does her job wrong. Her job description is youkai extermination, and lots of humans aren't particularly happy that she just befriends them instead, meaning she gets less donations than she might like. Of course, lots of humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">aren't aware of the fact</a> that they live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNatureReserve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNatureReserve">Fantastic Nature Reserve</a> and that Reimu is essentially the reserve's warden, either.

He does manage to afford flights to Germany, West Africa, and back mostly because he charged them all to Mosley's credit card. In the sequel, a book deal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and some loot from the Voodoo syndicate base</span> has given him the means to move to Germany and live in the family castle.

<ul><li> <em>Thief 2</em> zigzags on this, revealing that he has a hidden room in his apartment full of luxury goods. While he gets plenty of money from his occupation, he can't live it up <em>too</em> openly or people will get suspicious. However, his apartment is eventually raided by town guards partway through the game and he's forced to abandon it, starting from square one again.

This is due to her parents' insufficient income combined with the amount of children they must support (Yayoi is the oldest out of six). The status of 765Pro as a relatively small agency also means that Yayoi's income isn't all that big either, and she is perpetually doing domestic jobs in the office for chump change.

She is regularly unable to afford things like more or better clothes, and refuses anything which smacks of charity. Her obscenely rich teammate has to resort to all kinds of subterfuge to reduce Jade's costs and/or get her to accept the occasional gift. It also doesn't help that she's dating someone who has several dozen million dollars to throw around, but she will still only accept very personal and at least psuedo-romantic tokens of affection. As a result, she owns at least two nearly priceless mithril-based artifacts, several (dozen?) thousand dollars in custom precision-worked superhero devices, materials, and uniforms, and a casual-wear selection of clothes that hobos would consider sparse.

<ul><li> Of course, there have been some instances where Marge has been shown to secretly be thrifty so that when Homer does do something stupid, they can bail him out. Sub-standard food is apparently the trade off for a happy ending.

</li></ul></li><li> Bob of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> never seems to make any money off his business, and has stated that he's never actually paid his landlord rent on time. The fact that they continue to be forgiven on missing payments is odd considering their landlord is so greedy he tears nuts and bolts out of roller coasters while people are still on them. It was explained away in a season one episode: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mister Ficheoder is incredibly eccentric, and he is much more lenient with Bob's rent because he reminds him of his father, and because he considers Bob more interested in creating food than making money; "A Beef-artist! A Befartist! You're like a greasy, heterosexual Walt Whitman!"</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> shows the family occasionally cutting back on spending and have at least lost their house to their debt once (Peter had gone through several jobs before finally landing a stable job as a shipping clerk at a brewery, which doesn't pay too well), but the family is seen with two cars, a nice sized house with a backyard and four bedrooms, despite whatever money problems that hound them from time to time. While Peter's job doesn't pay a lot, it's implied that Lois may borrow money from her rich parents whenever things get tough.
<ul><li> Earlier episodes established that the house was paid off. The only reason they nearly lost it was because Peter had put it up as collateral when he bought the fishing boat.
</li><li> At one point in "Hanna Banana" when Chris is showing a video to try and prove the Evil Monkey's existence, among other things shown is Lois stealing from Chris' wallet, showing that the the Griffins might not be able to really financially support each other.
</li><li> On another occasion, it's shown that Lois has been <em>counterfeiting money</em> which her kids then steal from her...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">which might explain why they aren't completely destitute.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Hanna-Barbera's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LippyTheLionAndHardyHarHar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LippyTheLionAndHardyHarHar">Lippy the Lion and Hardy Har Har</a></em> seek their fortune time and again, and never attain it.
<ul><li> H-B's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopCat">Top Cat</a> uses conniving and hucksterism to keep his gang fed in an otherwise impoverished organization.
</li></ul></li><li> J. Michael Straczynski claimed that this was part of why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> is so funny—they're a world-famous ghost-hunting team, yet they're always just teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. (Egon's research budget must take more than the lion's share of the profits.)
</li><li> The crew of the Ghost in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> just barely manage to scrape by, often taking side jobs just to pay for fuel and parts.
</li><li> The Wattersons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> have a coin-operated fridge, no air conditioning, and can't even afford their own Wi-Fi since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS2E10TheTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS2E10TheTreasure">lost all the family's money to an internet scam</a> when Gumball was a baby</span>, yet they have a decently sized house, at least two cars and enough food to feed a family of five. They mostly seems to get by thanks Nicole's absurd penny-pinching skills (she once bought groceries with so many coupons that the <em>store</em> ended up paying her).
</li><li> The main four from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> are always tight on cash if not completely broke. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the episode "Let's Play Gangster Poker", where Mr. Cat finds out that Quack Quack is broke and wonders how he's able to afford <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">all the yogurt he eats.</a>
</li><li> The titular trio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfTheThreeCaballeros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfTheThreeCaballeros">Legend of the Three Caballeros</a></em> have this problem, which is no surprise given that they have the aforementioned Donald Duck (who's recently lost his job, house, and girlfriend) and Jose Carioca. They live in a run-down cabana that they inherited from Donald's grandfather Clinton Coot, they have to share it with each other (Donald in particular isn't happy about this), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">they can't fire the groundskeeper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Ari</a>. In fact, they only ever agreed to become adventurers to get money! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They get better by the ending, as Donald becomes the new president of the Quackmore Institute.</span>
