Unlike the clueless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Hero</a>, who just doesn't get romance, the Celibate Hero consciously and actively shuns it. They turn away every potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a> and shut out the pleas of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">official love interest</a>.
</p><p>While the term "celibacy" refers specifically to sexual activity, the history of celibacy connects the desire to romance someone with the desire to have sex with them, traditionally taking the form of marriage and kids. Ironically, the act of being celibate results in Celibate Heroes running into more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere">opportunities for romantic encounters</a> than if they were actively seeking them out (particularly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>). This is not to say that the Celibate Hero is unable to be affected by the force of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect">The Dulcinea Effect</a>, only that they either are acting on a higher ideal (chivalry) or resist its power later on.

Expect more than one reason to come into play, usually reinforcing one another; rarely do any of these show up alone. See the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/CelibateHero">Analysis</a> page for details.

</p><p>Please do not conclude a character is a Celibate Hero just because they lack any romantic arc. Without evidence to suggest a character would shun a sexual/romantic encounter, it's impossible to tell if they have chosen a celibate lifestyle.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>: Forced, but also decided on their own by the various teams themselves. They are awoken after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, so they are supposedly the last humans who survived... and part of the project they are members of does include the repopulation of the human species.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>: Keiichi Morisato has 7 goddesses after him, but hasn't even kissed his supposed love interest in over 2 decades and 270 chapters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted. In a stunning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a>, he was under mind control to never feel anything more than platonic love.</span>
</li><li> In the light novels, it is implied that Firo Prochainezo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> is one temporarily, although it is because the woman he is in love with is asexual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They do eventually get married... fifty years later.</span>
</li><li> Train Hartnett of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> has a severe tendency toward this: he gets grossed out by the idea of posing as the pretty Rinslet's husband, whacks Kyoko when she tries to kiss him, and in the anime, he puts a cat in front of his face so Kyoko kisses the kitty instead of him. Even with Saya, it's made clear that he only thought of her as a very close friend. He's also totally uninterested in men, much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Creed's</a> dismay.
</li><li> Yuno in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>, despite being a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Chick Magnet</a>, has no interest in women or dating whatsoever. He either ignores it or looks uncomfortable when women flirt with him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoreTheFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoreTheFanservice">averts his eyes at revealing sights</a> that give his male companions nosebleeds, and flat-out refuses to peep on the girls in the bath. This is because he has such a powerful crush on Sister Lily from his home village that he refuses to consider other romantic prospects.
</li><li> Taito Magatsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em>, despite being attractive and having several female characters display an interest in him, makes a point to avoid any kind of relationship. The girl he <em>shares a bed with</em> even comes out and asks him why he's never tried anything with her, and others have teased him about his lacking sex life. Most put it down to his dead little sister.
</li><li> Mafuyu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em>. In the manga, one of her past relationships ended abruptly because her boyfriend was arrested out of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPaedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPaedophile">Mistaken for Paedophile</a>. This somehow caused her to think she should never have any romance. In the anime, she simply thinks she has no time for dating, especially when she would rather watch anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: Lelouch Lamperouge, who has many characters, such as Shirley, Kallen, and Milly vying for his affection, along with every girl in his school. Lelouch, however, is a Celibate Hero who doesn't have the time for romance. Instead, he focuses on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">winning a war for his little sister</a>. The only reason we know he's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Hero</a> is because of that one time he asked Kallen to "comfort" him.
</li><li> Yanagin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em> hates the idea of dating in general, as she thinks guys are all losers. In fact, acts violently on the idea of <em>any</em> female dating a guy, or trying to make themselves attractive to a guy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> Light Yagami, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> doesn't seem to desire sex or romance (though he fits both "Love is a Distraction," given his obsession with the Death Note and "Love is Beneath Me," due to blatant narcissism), and treats his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmittenTeenageGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmittenTeenageGirl">Misa</a> quite coldly. He is <em>fully</em> aware of such matters, and uses the very <em>idea</em> of sexuality for his own benefit — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretending to read porn, supposedly unaware, in front of many security cameras designed to determine his likelihood of being Kira to ward off suspicion.</span> Basically, Light only has sex if it benefits him. To him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer">his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">sex</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">appeal</a> is a tactic — he's quite possibly incapable of feeling 'love' or 'desire' in a romantic sense. Even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light plays a truly spectacular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit">Memory Gambit</a> and temporarily turns good</span>, his feelings for Misa are still unclear. He is clearly concerned for her safety and treats her much more warmly, but since this change applies to the way he treats everyone, it need not suggest real "love". Of course, even if he wanted to progress their relationship further, being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">handcuffed to L 24/7 would make it somewhat difficult.</span>

<ul><li> Dr. Kenzo Tenma, after he saves the life of a boy over the city mayor — in defiance of the hospital director's orders.

</li><li> Nina Foertner/Anna Liebert is the same way and for the same reasons. She's far too busy hunting down her psychopathic brother to give a damn about romance. That said, she and Tenma do have one or two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moments that may avert this.
</li></ul></li><li> Ginko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mushishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mushishi">Mushishi</a></em> is very much this; though whether it's of his own volition or not is somewhat questionable. Due to possessing an unusual physiology that attracts <em>mushi</em> to him, he cannot stay in any one place or with a 'normal' person for a long period of time and is thus forced to wander the country while acting as a <em>mushi</em> exorcist of sorts. His unusual looks and calm, always-in-command personality make him an instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Chick Magnet</a> in-universe — but while he is kinder to most of the female characters than he is to the male ones, he has never displayed any active interest in romance. This might be indicative of supreme self-control or personal preference; despite having its fair share of romantic subplots involving the supporting cast, the story never brings up a serious prospective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> for Ginko.

A logical explanation could be that he became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">obsessed with revenge</a> before he was old enough to care about such things, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">fears that Itachi or his own "inner darkness" might destroy anyone he's close to.</a> What makes this particularly odd is that his other stated goal is to rebuild his clan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However in the epilogue, he and Sakura are together and have a daughter Sarada.</span>

This eventually makes him snap in <em>End of Evangelion</em> when he declares that since "Nobody loves [him], they should all just die." It is subverted in the fact that he <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads">in love with Asuka</a>, just too afraid of her and of attachment to pursue a relationship with her.

Characters will occasionally act perverted, though.
</li><li> Trafalgar Law is another notable example because of him being one of the few people in the world to have virtually no reaction to Boa Hancock's beauty, and unlike his crew, he also doesn't comment on the abundance of attractive women in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Amazon Lily</a>. He also shows nothing but annoyance towards flirting and is described by Monet as downright "unsociable".

</li><li> Ash Ketchum from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> knows what romance is, and has had a crush in the show, Giselle from the episode "School of Hard Knocks," but sees any relationship as a distraction from becoming the greatest Pokemon master.

In the <em>Burial</em> arc of the manga, it's shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the first people he ever killed intended to rape him</span>, and it's implied this wasn't an uncommon occurrence in his life, with his physical attractiveness inviting a lot of creepy attention.

He's not unaware of her own romantic attraction to him and isn't exactly unattracted to her himself, but he has ...<em>issues</em> with sex, due to the fact that, as a child, he was forced to watch his elder sister be raped and then murdered. He later learns that the one who did the deed was actually a servant of the same council of freedom fighters that he serves as a Samurai Gun; apparently, deliberately traumatising children so as to create recruits for the project was a deliberate tactic of theirs, to both make them "available", give them a way to control them, and to start their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>.

Whereas the anime gives them a brief moment of ship tease near the end of episode 11, but the series concludes with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">still being friends.</a>

In the original novels, however, it's a completely different matter, as Zel mentions at one point that if he ever were to become intimate with a woman, he would hurt her severely because of his rock skin (which also implies that he may not be a virgin). He opposes raping Lina Inverse in the first novel because of this, as opposed to a more awkward reaction that his anime counterpart would probably have. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> mentions his intimacy issues in an interview.

Despite working alongside a cute tomboy (Pao-Lin), an aloof bishoujo (Karina), and a hot career woman (Agnes), he has yet to spare any of them more than a passing glance.

She <em>is</em> looking for a lover, but she has <em>very</em> specific tastes — must be male, an earth pony, a hard worker, not too many years difference in age to her, capable of going with comparatively little sleep, strong and durable — and this combined with her aggressive efforts in searching for Mr. Right and her usual tendency to look in winter and then "try them out" by having them work alongside her in the spring (on the Acres, for multiple shifts, at least twelve hours at a stretch) means she's had absolutely no luck in finding somepony just yet, or at least in finding somepony who won't gallop away from her on every subsequent meeting. The locals she's tried dating have formed the opinion that what she's looking for isn't so much a coltfriend or even a husband as it is a source of free live-in farm-labor added to complimentary stud service; this opinion is described as "unfair, and unkind, but <em>not</em> entirely inaccurate." Applejack isn't exactly looking to just find a decently healthy earth pony stallion to stud her and then raise the foals on her own — but romance would pretty much have to fall on her head if it was going to get her attention, and with Apple Bloom seemingly on track for a non-farming mark and Big Mac impossible to herd into dating, her current top priority is to make sure the farm has a next generation.

The defiance of the rule by Anakin and the forbidden love that ensued was a crucial plot point. Technically, the code stated that Jedi were not allowed to form romantic attachments. One-night stands were okay but serious relationships and marriage were prohibited unless specifically approved by the Jedi Council, which was very, very rare.
<ul><li> The old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Expanded Universe</a> showed that Anakin was far from the only Jedi during the pre-Empire era to violate that rule, including a breakaway faction that openly rejected it.

</li><li> This seems to be getting glossed over in more recent books: apparently it was okay for Professor Earwig to marry, as long as he retired (see "The Sea And Little Fishes", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AHatFullOfSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AHatFullOfSky">A Hat Full of Sky</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>), and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>, we're told the students in the Post-Mortem Communication Department view the black robes and skull ring as a "babe magnet".

</li><li> Rincewind, despite being a scruffy abject coward, is propositioned by ladies surprisingly more than one would expect. Or, he at least seems to spend a lot of time around them, including the scantily clad variety. However, as his mind is usually occupied with running away, nothing ever comes of it. Also, he's aware of his status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Cosmic Plaything</a> and Fate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, so any time someone is nice to him, he assumes it's to set him up for a bigger fall.
<ul><li> Once, while abandoned on a desert island, he is approached by several amazon-types looking for a man to help them procreate and rebuild their civilization. Unfortunately for him, he was completely obsessed with potatoes at the time and thought that they were offering him some. It was only some time after he was whisked away by magic that he belatedly realized what they had been offering. Talk about missing the ball.

After all, she tamed that unicorn... which really shocked her friend Nanny Ogg and the revelation made Ridcully, her one-time love interest, get rather soppy. Note that Granny's celibacy has nothing to do with magic, as witches aren't subject to the same prohibitions as wizards. Granny comes under the "Love is a distraction" heading, though; it's a distraction from the pursuit of magic, so in a way, her celibacy does have something to do with magic.

He's smart enough to foist interaction with women on his companions for the most part but seems profoundly uncomfortable when this is not possible.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>
<ul><li> Raistlin Majere, antihero of the books, is a Celibate Hero. Actively manipulating the lovesick, annoying Crysania to his advantage, he resists the temptation to actually do anything with her because A) it's beneath a mage of his stature, B) he can't afford to be distracted from his "Overthrow the Gods for No Good Reason" project, and C) he had sex once before and was crap at it. And, though it's not explicitly stated, suspicions are that, were he to actually try anything as physically vigorous as sex with Crysania, he'd probably just wind up coughing blood all over her and collapsing into a heap, which, whatever way you look at it, isn't very romantic. There is possibly some inconsistency over whether Raistlin actually ever had sex or not. The Legends trilogy very strongly implies that he did, with one of Caramon's ex-girlfriends but <em>The Soulforge</em>, which covers the time period it would have happened equally strongly implies he remained a virgin (there is a girl, again a lover of Caramon and there appears to be budding mutual affection but... well read it yourselves).
</li><li> There was a short story called "Raistlin's Daughter", which implied he may have had a daughter, in the more or less conventional way and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">magically made to forget the experience</a>. Interestingly the entire story is treated as an in-universe rumour and when Raistlin encounters a girl claiming to be his daughter in <em>Dragons of Summer Flame</em> he drolly comments on his bad luck at sleeping with a beautiful woman and not remembering it. For the record, the girl in question is not his daughter, much to the relief of his nephew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Palin</a>.

<ul><li> Harry Dresden spends a heck of a lot of the novels not getting any, and being quite bitter about it. Though he's given a few chances, he never takes them because they generally come with a lot of baggage (e.g. she's a lust demon, or his underage apprentice), and he refuses to enter into a relationship which isn't pure and based on love, and he also doesn't want to bring anyone else into his dangerous world if he can help it. The fact that his first girlfriend was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brainwashed into trying to kill him, and whom he thought for years he had killed</span> and his second girlfriend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> got turned into a vampire because of his involvement with her</span> may have something to do with it. Although even with that track record, succubi making fun of how pathetic your sex life is has got to hurt. It gets to the point where it turns out Harry's latest love interest was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">psychically mind-controlled into being attracted to him.</span>
</li><li> Having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Carlos, who until that point certainly talked a good game,</span> outed as a virgin by said succubus must have taken some of the sting out of it (or at least given him an ample means of redirecting the mockery). It also makes him another example, though his reason (for that matter, whether it's a conscious choice or just lack of opportunity) isn't explored.

This accounts for a complete lack of romance in the first three books, even when a pairing up, first with his friend's sister and then with Tenar, looked to be inevitable. All the mages in Earthsea are celibate by rule, in theory because they will lose their power unless they are chaste, though the truth of this belief is not exactly confirmed. It's implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tehanu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tehanu">Tehanu</a></em> (by a village witch, who may not be the most reliable source) that wizards use some sort of spell to render themselves asexual, or possibly just make it easier to be completely celibate. She doesn't go into details. Later on, Ged mentions he just didn't think of it or feel any urge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he lost his powers</span>.

In this case, rather than force her servants to torture themselves, the Goddess simply removes their ability to feel sexual desire entirely.

The trait was especially pronounced with the Seventh Doctor, something which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> acknowledged by making it a sure-fire sign that Seven was <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">Not Himself</a> if he suddenly started fancying someone. Upon encountering River Song in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em> story, Seven says that he can clearly sense that she will somehow hold great meaning to him in his future, but the only reasons as to why he can think of is that she is either going to be his "dearest friend" or "darkest enemy"; he simply cannot think of any other possibility. The truth, of course, is that he is going to marry her as the Eleventh Doctor.
</li><li> The 2005 revival began to avert the trope by establishing that the Doctor is perfectly capable of falling in love with his companions, and even having sexual interests, though this is never addressed explicitly. It's finally averted fully with the arrival of River Song, who becomes the Doctor's wife. Subtle references to their love life crop up, but even then, that romance is almost wholly off-screen. The Doctor has paradoxically more screentime with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">the more kid-friendly</a>, platonic romance he shares with later companion Clara. The Doctor becoming too obsessed with his companion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">too afraid of losing her</a> even becomes a major part of the plot at the end of their tenure together. He eventually proves his maturity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">by being willing to let go</a> and let the two of them go their different ways, rather than staying in a loving-but-tense friendship that's in danger of becoming dysfunctional (and hurting both of them and others in the process). Before that, the Doctor had a platonic romance and a good friendship with two other female companions, but the outcome of their stories was often criticized as the Doctor whining about losing them, all the while taking them for granted. His less peeved and remorseful farewell to his more recent companion was seen by many as something of an apology for those past mistakes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">him growing in emotional confidence as a character</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> is universally considered as such in Christianity.

</li><li> The Christian parts of the Bible doesn't mention if he was or was not married to a person. But there are repeated metaphors about the Christian Church itself being the "Bride of Christ". Jesus also talks about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">eunuchs</a> who become so for God's sake (with the disclaimer that it's not for everyone, but for those who can take it). Most interpret this as advocating celibacy. However. some early Christians took it literally and castrated themselves.
</li><li> When answering the question the Sadducees posed on Him about whose wife a woman would be of the seven brothers that married her and left her childless when the resurrection takes place, Jesus implies that all who will be resurrected will be celibate, for "they will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in Heaven."
</li></ul></li><li> While the Apostle Paul was celibate, many other early disciples-turned-leaders (thus the proto-clergy) were married, like the Apostle Peter whose wife and mother-in-law are mentioned. Discussed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians">Book of Corinthians</a> — Paul suggests that while being celibate helps one to focus their life to glorify the God, it is completely optional. If one cannot resist the temptation of sex, he recommends the believers to marry each other to get rid of the temptation instead.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a>, the 144,000 of the twelve tribes of Israel will be celibate virginal men who have not "defiled themselves with women".
</li><li> For its first few centuries Christianity universally allowed married priests due to the above, even after a schism that divided it into Eastern and Western halves. But since 1139, Roman Catholic priests have been required to be celibate in imitation of Christ. This continues today for modern Roman Catholic priests (well, at least the majority who are faithful, and who were not originally Anglicans that converted after becoming priests and being married).
</li><li> Roman Catholic nuns as well (and nuns in general), along with monks. They're considered heroic by believers for giving this up as part of a higher calling.
</li><li> Eastern Catholic priests (the one in communion with Rome) are a double subversion—they can be married men, as long as marriage is done prior to ordination. In both Eastern and Western (read: Roman) Rites, once you are ordained, you can no longer marry.
</li><li> Same rules apply to Eastern Orthodox Priests, as well as deacons in all rites. A man under Holy Orders is not permitted to take a wife unless given express permission to do so (which in the case of deacons is usually only given if his first wife dies and leaves him to raise minor children as a single father, and in the case of priests is extremely rare; it is unheard of in the case of bishops).

</li><li> Artemis in particular was often shown with a company of huntresses who swore off men. Or at least <em>tried,</em> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">the male gods didn't always care</a>.

</li><li> Theseus' son Hippolytus was one of these, and it got him killed. There are risks to swearing off love forever when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess">Aphrodite</a> is very real and very petty.

</li><li> This is a common test of knights on their quests, especially for the Holy Grail, in the Arthurian legend.

However, it would also be in keeping with the philosophy to only engage in procreative sex with contraception, after being sterilized, or have an abortion if the former fails.
</li><li> As surprising as it may seem, Epicurus and his philosophy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism">Epicureanism</a> are reported as advising to be this. Indeed while judging pleasure to be the highest good, Epicurus made a classification of pleasure: 1) the natural and necessary ones (eating and sleeping), 2) the natural but unnecessary (sex), and 3) the unnecessary and unnatural (power and politics). Giving that according to Epicurus sex fits the second type and that he himself never married and had no children, it's pretty clear that he encouraged people to be single. However, there's no indication that he forbade it either, as there's mention of married Epicureans in the Garden, and one letter has him advise a young man who loves sex on how to do this responsibly (since he clearly wasn't just going to stop). The later Epicureans appears to have been more positive on this, and most probably married. Moreover, translation of the quote that Epicurus is reported to have laid this out in has been questioned by later scholars, who feel the real meaning was that a wise person should refrain from marriage and sex only depending on the circumstances. Epicurus' will, for instance, provides for one student's child marrying another Epicurean in the future. What's indisputable, however, is that he and later Epicureans cautioned people to take care with romantic love, knowing it could cause harm. Epicurus extolled friendship-we can surmise that he'd think marriage should be based on that.

Though this side effect is described as a common and likely result of their hormonal adjustment, it is not universal or absolute when it does occur, leading to a few exceptions:

Pre-augmentation, two members of Black Team were into each other, going so far as to make out in the showers (they were clothed, but it was pretty intense and it's possible they might have gone farther). As luck would have it, another member of their team happened to be an exception as well, apparent from his ratting them out in jealousy. They seem to have become fully celibate after getting their augmentations, but some tensions still remain.
</li><li> Another Spartan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHaloGraphicNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHaloGraphicNovel">Maria-062</a>, is officially retired from combat duty and intends to start a family; it's possible she was one of those too badly injured to maintain active service. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Another Spartan, Randall-037, also did something similar and even had a daughter</span>.

However, the reason why Rean keeps some distance is because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what happened at the climax of <em>Cold Steel III</em>. Because he is the one who kills the corrupted Nameless One, he is chosen to become a sacrifice for the rivalries to reform the Great One and does indeed die at the end of the normal ending of <em>IV</em>.

Lawrence</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">of Arabia</a>) of having homosexual relations, most evidence points to him having a deep-seated fear of sexuality.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol">Andy Warhol</a>'s family insists that he died a virgin, and despite his often-erotic art, there is good evidence in his biography to believe this. He was also a devout Byzantine Catholic, which may have played a part in his decision.
</li><li> General Charles Gordon (of Khartoum). Similar to Lawrence, many historians (notably Lytton Strachey) depict him as a closet homosexual or even a pederast. He certainly spent a lot of time caring for orphaned boys through his charity work. But in all likelihood, Gordon was chaste, if not actually asexual, largely due to his evangelical Christianity. He once wrote a friend that he wished he was a eunuch!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> is speculated by some scholars (including Freud) to not have been homosexual, but celibate. He himself wrote: "The act of procreation and anything that has any relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there were no pretty faces and sensuous dispositions." - which doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't engaging in it. However, being homosexual seems more likely (he was arrested for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">sodomy,</a> after all). Da Vinci's only known intimate relationships were with men, so it seems likely.
</li><li> "Gray" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality">asexuality</a> can present like this. It's worth noting that the asexual community considers it to be more of a spectrum than an "either-or" situation, so some people might genuinely be heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, while not being generally interested in having sex (they just have <em>romantic</em> attraction to one or another gender).
