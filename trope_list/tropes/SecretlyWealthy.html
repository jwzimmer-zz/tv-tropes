Many savvy characters spot this trend and hide their wealth. For some, they've even been separated from the family, and are wealthy in name only. Expect these characters to be kind, caring and generally the opposite of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>, so that the reveal of their wealth is more shocking.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, there are several advantages to attempting this. Large wealth disparity tends to create serious rifts in casual social interaction; friends of a lower-income class may secretly resent you, or expect large monetary gifts and favors. On the other side of the coin, it is also hard to know who likes you for yourself, and who only likes you for your money (this is a reason many rich people only cavort amongst their own class). In addition, those who are known to be wealthy are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">frequent targets for lawsuits</a>, and family members may even be targeted for kidnapping by those looking for a ransom. Hiding your wealth can prevent many problems like these.

</li><li> The female protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere">Onidere</a></em> is from a wealthy family but nobody at her high school knew about that until her younger sister came for a visit.
</li></ul><ul><li> Sayako in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba">Mahoraba</a></em> lives in near poverty with her daughter. She makes plastic flowers and such for money and often needs help from Ryushi to complete whatever junk she and her daughter are making to survive. Their furniture and bedding are the cardboard boxes for shipping the flowers. Turns out she ran away from home to marry someone her father disapproved of. She comes from an extraordinarily wealthy family and she and her father appear to make up their differences though she continues to live with her daughter in poverty.
</li><li> Konoka Konoe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> is very rich, with only the fabulously wealthy Ayaka even coming close. Not that you'd ever know this by looking at her. Even her roommate was unaware until she actually visited Konoka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>. Even after the reveal, she never makes a big deal out of it, the only real mention of her wealth was when Jack Rakan nonchalantly billed her father 5,000,000 drachmae for helping her friends.
<ul><li> Very late in the manga, it's revealed that Chizuru is also extremely wealthy, but like Konoka, she never makes mention of it or flaunts her wealth.
</li><li> Fate Averruncus might be an example also. He's taken in and given shelter to <em>62</em> girls who are all war orphans and sent them all (minus his minstra) to good private schools.

Himekawa is a variation: everyone <em>knows</em> he's rich, being the heir to a powerful family empire and all, just not to what extent. He's also not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>, considering he uses his cash to try and be the top delinquent at Ishiyama High and does <em>know</em> how to fight, rather than stick with his friend and try to rule the country.
</li><li> Kotobuki Tsumugi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> is extremely sensitive about the fact that her family is filthy rich. She is unable to hide that fact completely, but she does her best to not draw attention to this. At one point in the manga, the other girls thank her for all she's done for them with her wealth <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0m9nd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0m9nd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0m9nd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as getting them good deals at her family's music store or letting them practice in one of their many vacation houses</span>. She actually gets upset by this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">wondering how they figured out she's rich</a> (Mio wonders how she believed they <em>hadn't</em> figured it out).

She's so excited about being a high schooler she decided to get a part-time job because highschoolers usually have that sort of job. Her employer hired her because he thinks she must be poor to be desperate enough to "forge" a high schooler card. Since he never told her what he thinks, she's oblivious to the misunderstanding. She's actually wealthy (though she never sets out to deliberately hide that fact, it's just unimportant to her so she rarely ever brings it up).

Those who are only pretty rich will buy fancy clothes and jewelry and homes to try to make themselves seem much richer, but those who are supremely wealthy don't need to. Why buy new furniture when the stuff your grandparents bought was so good that it has lasted all these years? Why dress nicely when you don't need to work so you can devote all your time to messy hobbies like raising swamp dragons? And ironically, this allows them to <em>stay</em> rich. Sybil Ramkin is the best example, but Lady Margolotta and the Dowager Duchess of Quirm also qualify. And Sybil's husband Sam Vimes was born poor but is now the richest man in the city. So naturally, he prefers dented armor and cheap boots to the finery his station allows.
<ul><li> Except cigars. He likes the good cigars he can afford now that he's loaded.

Two Okies discuss a Broadway play about a rich man and a rich woman who pretend to be poor in order to find true love.

Wells is nursed to health and upset when Christine tells him the hotel is going to be sold to Curtis O'Keefe who will turn the classic hotel into just another one of his chain. Over dinner, Wells tells Christine and boyfriend/manager Peter a tale of how he seemed to be ripped off in a gold mine by his partner only for his partner to reveal he had actually made sure he kept his fortune. Wells thus informs the dumbfounded pair that he's actually one of the richest men in the country who owns several properties...and just bought this very hotel. The staff is naturally thrown by this with the accountant moaning over actually calling about Wells' credit. Chuckling, Wells' lawyer says that because the man like a low-key appearance, his bank is long used to people calling unaware of how rich Wells is.

A trio of adult children tries to find a boyfriend for their widowed mother Phyllis so she'll stop interfering in their lives. They seem to find a suitor in Monty, a man known for his rich life who promises Phyllis some terrific times and whisks her to the islands. The kids then discover the guy lost all his money and are thus convinced he's a con artist about to bilk her. They race to stop the wedding only to learn Monty did lose his cash but ended up becoming richer than ever.

The Light Ones are far too moral for that. But later on, he learns that his company ATM card doesn't appear to have a limit. When he asks his boss about it, the guy looks at him and says that they can predict the future pretty accurately. How hard would it be for them to play the stock market or currency exchange rates? It's just not in their nature to be greedy, but yes, the organization has a fairly large budget. The boss is even considering buying a company jet and offers the protagonist to buy a Bentley. The protagonist instead decides to buy an SUV for family trips. His boss just shrugs.
