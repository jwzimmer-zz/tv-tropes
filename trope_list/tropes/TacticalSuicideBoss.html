</div></div><p>In video games, it's quite common for a boss to only be vulnerable at a particular time. It's one thing if it's due to the boss needing to catch their breath every so often or the like. But sometimes, it's just because a given attack leaves them open. Maybe it exposes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakSpot">weak spot</a> while preparing the giant laser, maybe their attacks double as weapons or platforms that the player can use to reach their target, maybe on occasion it decides to just stand there laughing at you with its defenses down, or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">it will keep charging head on into walls</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">until it dies</a>.

Since it involves the boss intentionally leaving themselves open, it also heavily involves carrying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>. Finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> heavily comes into play - it's usually in retrospect that you realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a> the boss in question is for continuing to perform the attack even after it's been exploited several times. With animal bosses or others too unintelligent to realize their mistake, this can be justified, and to an extent it can make sense with robotic bosses as well, but in that case you have to wonder who designed and programmed them...
</p><p>There's a variation of this where the boss <em>does</em> stop using a particular move that leaves it open to attack... only to then use a <em>different</em> move that <em>also</em> leaves it open to attack.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a>: The boss will use one of several attacks randomly, but only a fraction of them (often just one) leaves it vulnerable to damage. Since the length you have to survive for is dependent on how often the boss makes the suicidal attacks, the fight is partially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, and can easily make for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">Goddamned Boss</a>.
</li><li> Set Pattern: The boss has a fixed cycle of attacks, and at some point renders itself vulnerable.
</li><li> Analytical/Responsive: The boss will make itself vulnerable if given a certain situation. If the boss was run by a smart analytical AI, it would only use the vulnerable attack as a last resort, when no safe attack is possible (possibly not even then, if the boss doesn't care about letting the player live). But usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> is applied deliberately to prevent the game from becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>, especially if the boss always has safe attack options available. Alternatively, there may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical RockPaperScissors</a> system where the boss defending itself from one kind of attack leaves it vulnerable to another, forcing the player to work out the right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos">Combo</a> of attacks to defeat it.

If he didn't drop his rocket launcher in the final battle, all he'd have to do is float there with his jetpack until the withdrawing floor beneath you finally collapses and drops Bond into the pit. Earlier, he'd have been invulnerable if he hadn't called in the mooks that helpfully provide you with the rocket launcher when killed, nor would there have been a problem if he had chosen not to stop the fans protecting the air vents above the geothermal power station. On top of this, Bond never would have been able to locate and destroy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cloning facility</span> had Bloch not shoved him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">the pool that leads to it</a> and instead shot Bond in the head while he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">Distracted by the Sexy</a>.

It is usually hidden, but can be targeted when the Centipede is rearing for a body slam attack.

<ul><li> The Gray, which normally will harden in reaction to your attack. Its main attack, a steely tendril, leaves it unprotected until it is retracted.

However, at certain points it fires out four flying saw blades, which again render it immobile and vulnerable until they return.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Void Eater</a> is only vulnerable when using its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay">beam attack</a>. Trying to attack it at any other point (or even getting close, for that matter) well result in you getting splattered all over the screen. If you attack a mobile black hole, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">deserve exactly what you get</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">Razor Queen</a> is only vulnerable to attack after it charges you.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> series:

Throughout the fight, Batman is standing on a small platform. She occasionally makes strangling vines burst from the ground, but only on 2/3 of the platform at a time. She also spends the fight encased in a batarang-proof transparent dome, but she occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">opens it to laugh at Batman</a>.

It's widely considered one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver">best boss fights</a> in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Arkham Knight</a></em>, the eponymous Arkham Knight has serious problems noticing patterns.
<ul><li> When Batman fights his tank, he needs to destroy the four coolant reserves located outside the tank, while Knight uses a slow 360 degree check to look around. While Batman will be forced to flee after destroying one, the Knight could just guard the last remaining weak point, but he still keeps on looking around him, allowing Batman to destroy the last one.
</li><li> In the second fight, he chases the Batmobile to tunnels which are filled with explosives, heavily damaging his excavator in progress. This happens four times.
</li><li> And finally, he fails to realize that Batman is attacking from directly below his vantage points; He seems to check there every now and then, but he does control a drone, which he could just position to guard the area below the vantage point.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Riddler</span> runs into a similar problem as Poison Ivy, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">he keeps turning off the force-field</a> on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> to bring in more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a>.

This is not usually a problem, except during a timed challenge mission where the boss can only be hurt during Witch Time. During that mission, you are entirely at the mercy of whether it decides to use the two attacks that leave it vulnerable.
</li><li> Almost all of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyHatcherAndTheGiantEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyHatcherAndTheGiantEgg">Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg</a></em> do this. With most of the bosses, all you have to do is dodge everything until they mess up and become vulnerable; sometimes the bosses do the dumbest or clumsiest things to allow them to be harmed.
</li><li> The Alien Robot at the end of the second level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames">freeware</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BinaryBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BinaryBoy">Binary Boy</a></em> would have been invulnerable if he didn't feel the need to randomly shoot behind him, often hitting his own ship. Needless to say, he shuts down once the ship is destroyed.
</li><li> The Metal Queen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalLegend">Brütal Legend</a></em>, a giant spider who'll expose her soft underbelly periodically. Possibly justified in that a wild animal would take more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">a few hits</a> to be trained into not using that attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bug">Bug</a></em> had three of the bosses fall under this:
<ul><li> The giant horned lizard from Reptilia combines this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>. It would use an attack that made boulders fall from the sky in an attempt to crush you... which then roll into catapults at the sides of the arena. It would then <em>move into range</em> of the catapults, allowing Bug to launch them at him.
</li><li> The octopus from Quaria throws fish at you, in which case Bug uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">tennis racket to bat them back to his big head</a>.
</li><li> The main villain, Queen Cadavra, tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyFlopCrushing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellyFlopCrushing">squash Bug with her huge girth</a> after every attack phase, landing on the platform Bug was on. This allowed Bug to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> her, which he normally couldn't hit since she attacked from the background. It gets even more tactical suicide later on in her final phase where she <em>repeatedly</em> attempts to use the squashing attack.
</li></ul></li><li> Six out of eight bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a> 2</em> are this, providing you with the projectiles needed to defeat them (the others are victims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>.) The final boss, a robot made by Fatcat, takes the cake: he drops bombs on the ground every time he flies into the air, which the player is then supposed to throw at him at the precise moment... or they can just not touch the bomb at all and wait for him to land back on the bomb.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cortex in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996">the first game</a>. Why do you bother shooting at him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">green</a> lasers that can be spun back at you, when you could simply have continued with the red and blue ones that couldn't? Also, lowering your energy shield at the same time you blow open a hole in the floor with mines is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">just asking for it</a>, really...
<ul><li> That's not the end of it, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Cortex</a> is the only one who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">purposely uses it.</a> Koala Kong throws rocks at you, but he gets so tired that the third one lands in front of you, where you can spin it back. Then we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">N. Brio</a>, who eventually drinks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a> that turns him into a powerful mutant. However, while attacking you, hitting the ground with his hands causes a block to fall from the ceiling, letting you jump on his head.
</li></ul></li><li> The Komodo Bros. in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack">the second game</a>. Had Moe just kept throwing his swords at Crash instead of sending Joe spinning around after him, the latter wouldn't get himself dizzy so Crash can send him bouncing back into Moe.
</li><li> Ripper Roo in the second game. While in the first encounter, the explosives came from somewhere upstream, here he creates them himself and actually sets them off, getting himself caught in the explosion which in turn leaves him vulnerable for Crash to attack. Though given the heavy implication that he's a masochist, Roo might be intentionally evoking this trope.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">the third game</a>, Tiny wouldn't be vulnerable if he kept trying to stomp on Crash instead of using his trident, Dingodile should've just kept shooting fireballs into the air instead of destroying the crystals around him, and is there any particular reason at all why N. Tropy creates a trail of platforms leading to him when he becomes exhausted?
</li><li> Tropy's mistake from the third game is repeated again at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> game <em>Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTwinsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTwinsanity">Crash Twinsanity</a></em>, Cortex not only uses three attacks, only one of which you can deflect, but he actually <em>tells you how to beat him.</em>
<div class="indent"> <em>It's sort of like a birthday party, except... The exact opposite. Let's start handing out the presents... *gets on his hoverboard* This is from Tiny. *throws a bomb* This is from Dingodile. *throws another bomb* Ripper Roo, you shouldn't have! *another bomb* Pinstripe, how thoughtful! *and another* Oh dear, two of the same! *throws a final bomb and starts charging his ray gun* <strong>Here's one gift you can return!</strong> *fires*</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> Roxie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderOfCenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderOfCenty">Crusader of Centy</a></em> consists of a cartoon heart somehow protected by a person-shaped silhouette of string. It can swing its arms like flails or fire them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punches</a>. Its other attack is an anime-style charge up that releases an eight-way energy wave — and also temporarily collapses the string, leaving its heart open to damage. Roxie would be invulnerable if its random programming simply never used that last attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryptOfTheNecroDancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryptOfTheNecroDancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> Amplified</em>, The Conductor creates five batteries during her second phase. These batteries have wires that electrify your attacks, causing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning">zap any enemies adjacent to the one you attacked</a>. Doing this also drains the batteries' power, meaning she would have been invincible if she didn't constantly summon enemies that you could attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CursedTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CursedTreasure">Cursed Treasure</a></em> - the pirate ship hurls smoke bombs that you can throw back for considerable damage, and the High Priest projects a force field that can only be shattered by the swords of his own templars, then unleashes a squad of said templars to attack you. The Barbarian Queen can also fall into this, when she stops to sing the gems toward her; if she picks a bad location, she will take more than a little damage as all your towers rip into her.
</li><li> Happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls">Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls</a></em>. Granted, most of the bosses are little kids who might not be that smart about fighting.
<ul><li> Jataro's robot's weak point would never have been exposed if he didn't keep throwing bombs that you can send back at him, and instead kept shooting missiles.
</li><li> Kotoko's fight is in an arena filled with water, with some dry raised areas. If she kept slashing you or she only stabbed the ground above dry land, you'd never have been able to expose her weak point by electrocuting the water.
</li><li> The fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genocide Jack</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies</a> this. The boss needs to periodically recharge, which also leaves them open to attack. After the fight, the protagonist realizes the boss could have just killed her much faster, but they gave her a chance.
</li></ul></li><li> Both bosses of Iron Canopy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em> are of this variety. The Brood Mother has a sucking in air "attack", which doesn't actually do anything but let you feed her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">tasty morsel</a> to give you a shot at her vulnerable backside. The boss of the area, Silitha, will occasionally interrupt her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a> to stand briefly still and taunt you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ceaseless Discharge is a giant boss that you fight from a cliff that's at his chest height. He's pretty tough to beat fighting him legitimately, however there's a built-in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">Easy Level Trick</a> where if you run back to the fog wall immediately after angering him by looting the corpse he's guarding, he'll chase you back there until he runs out of ground to stand on. For some reason, rather than do his ranged fire breath attack from safe ground, he'll try and leap over the huge pit to get at you. This results in him hanging off the side of the cliff, completely helpless. You can then attack the arm he's hanging on with until he lets go and falls to his death instantly. What's worse is that if you die to him, when you come back, he <em>will</em> use his fire breath on you if you just stand by the fog wall after re-entering. You have to run all the way back up to the corpse to sufficiently piss him off again and then run all the way back before he'll try jumping at you.
</li><li> A minor example with Seath the Scaleless. He's completely invincible until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> is destroyed. You can destroy it yourself, or trick Seath into accidentally destroying it while trying to attack you. If he ends up destroying it, he stops attacking to curse his own stupidity for a few seconds allowing you to get some good damage in.
</li></ul></li><li> The penultimate boss of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans">Destroy All Humans!</a></em> has a penchant for attacking Crypto's saucer with AA missiles. Missiles that you can redirect to their source with a simple press of a button, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">assuming you have the right saucer upgrade installed</a>. The boss never wises up to this tactic and continues to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> you until it gets blown apart by it own munitions.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> series has a few examples.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">the first game</a>:
<ul><li> Boss Dumb Drum is an animated iron barrel that hovers above the top border of the screen and spits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> relentlessly. Once in a while, it descends to try to squash Donkey and Diddy. The player just has to move out of the way, because it eventually breaks itself doing that. If Drum only released enemies and kept itself afloat, they would be unable to win. (In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> remake, Drum doesn't damage itself — instead, TNT barrels appear after defeating a wave of enemies, which the Kongs must pick up and throw at the boss.)
</li><li> King K. Rool can only be hurt by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">jumping on his head</a>. However, you can't jump on his head because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny">his crown is too pointy</a>. So naturally, his main method of attack is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedHeadgear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedHeadgear">take it off and throw it at you like a boomerang</a>, leaving his head exposed for the duration.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a></em>:
<ul><li> The player would be unable to pass beyond the first boss, Krow, if he didn't throw his own eggs at you so you can pick them up to throw back at him.
</li><li> K. Rool shoots spiked cannonballs at the player, but will sometimes shoot out an ordinary cannonball which can be thrown back at him to jam his gun. <em>Nine times</em>. (Ten if you count the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry3DixieKongsDoubleTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry3DixieKongsDoubleTrouble">Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Belcha spits out barrels containing Knik-Knaks (beetle enemies) at the Kongs. Tossing Knik-Knaks into Belcha's mouth causes him to burp so heavily he pushes himself back towards the edge of the platform. If he didn't spit barrels, Belcha would inevitably push the Kongs off their side of the platform.
</li><li> Kaos has blades spinning out from its body that do nothing except provide platforms to reach the weak point — its head.
</li><li> If Barbos didn't send out minions or launch homing missiles at you, you'd have no way to damage her shield.
</li><li> K. Rool gets even dumber than before, as his battle overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>: you can only damage him with barrels, which are dropped into the arena from levers which become available as he attacks. <em>Twice</em> in the same game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>:
<ul><li> Army Dillo would be undefeatable if he didn't reveal his face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">to laugh at Donkey Kong</a> while letting DK throw TNT barrels at him.
</li><li> When fighting King K. Rool with Tiny Kong, he will repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">butt-slam</a> the arena to cause shockwaves. Eventually, his butt gets too sore to keep doing it and he moans in pain for a while, leaving him wide open to attack.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Doom">Doom</a></em>* at the end of the first game, where you face two Barons of Hell, there is a bug in the game where there is an attack that will cause a Baron to think the attacker is... himself. If you've already killed the other one, you can just stop and watch as he proceeds to claw himself, <em>and</em> cry out in pain over the attacks, until he dies and you win. It is hilarious when it happens.
</li><li> In the tower level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy">Dynamite Headdy</a></em>, Trouble Bruin can only be hurt when he moves himself toward you (as opposed to his other move, destroying a section of the tower). It's pretty much out of the player's control though.
</li><li> Twinblade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> has an attack where he stabs the ground, usually when the player is standing right behind him, where he can actually be damaged. He's invulnerable at all other times.
</li><li> Both bosses in World 1 and World 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FancyPantsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FancyPantsAdventures">Fancy Pants Adventures</a></em> suffer from this. The penguin is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">Bullfight Boss</a> who will always get his horns/flippers stuck in the wall, allowing you to jump on him. The rabbit, on the other hand, cannot be defeated by jumping on him at all, yet he still jumps high and drops spiders on you, though a snail always drops with them which can be used to beat him. To make matters worse, kicking him after hitting him with a snail shell will make him almost immediately use the same move again (with several more spiders, admittedly).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> All four of the first bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasies IV</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">VII</a></em> are meant to get the player, who may be used to turn-based gameplay, used to the Active Time Battle system, especially the idea that the battle continues, and the boss continues to act, even if you don't, and that sometimes you'll need to wait.
</li><li> The first boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Guard Scorpion, has a defensive mode where it counterattacks any attack with severe force, but otherwise takes no action. Now ordinarily, it would make sense not to remain in this mode the entire time. However, the encounter begins shortly after the party sets a bomb to blow up the reactor they're in, and the defensive mode would be far more effective at delaying their escape.
</li><li> With regards to Whelk, the first boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">staying in its shell for the entire battle doesn't make it invulnerable</a>, it merely takes a <em>lot</em> longer to destroy it. It's even possible to ignore the warning to not attack the shell since its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">MP</a> is very low and healing the party is easy despite the powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Counterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Counterattack">counterattack</a>. You even get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">slightly more useful drop</a> (A MP recovery item as opposed an HP one) if you kill the shell. Later on, you can pull a similar trick with a stronger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> to get <em>two</em> of the items it drops.
</li><li> As for the Wing Raptor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, it's actually completely defeatable in guard mode, but it counterattacks viciously if attacked.
</li></ul></li><li> Some bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fraxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fraxy">Fraxy</a></em> will flip open to expose their weakpoints after some time, then close them again. Some attacks are also tuned to start when this happens, so watch out!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar3">Gears of War 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Lambent Berserker would be all but invincible if her ribcage didn't open and expose her glowing Imulsion core whenever she charges, which she does a lot.
</li><li> In the downloadable campaign "RAAM's Shadow", General RAAM would be all but invulnerable if he would stop deploying his Kryll shield to attack the humans, instead relying on his blade (which the player can do during the segments where you play as him) or stalling until the Kryllstorm claimed them. In <em>Gears of War</em> (chronologically later), he smartens up and carries a Troika instead, retroactively eliminating that weakness.
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> series there's Sardius, the final boss of <em>Super Ghouls 'N' Ghosts</em>. He can only hurt you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">from his mouth</a>, and whenever he does so, he also creates magical platforms that Arthur can ride up to reach Sardius' weak spot, his head.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">God of War II</a></em>: Subverted in the Zeus battle. First, Zeus is giant and you can't directly attack him. However, he summons sirens that release a deadly shockwave when you kill them, which damages him. The other stage is Zeus shrinking and fighting Kratos straight up. After awhile, Zeus remembers that he's the freakin' king of the gods, and starts bombarding Kratos with an endless stream of lightning. Kratos has to trick him to beat him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em>: Many bosses in the series are only vulnerable when they are about to fire a particular weapon; if they would refrain from using that particular attack, the Vic Viper wouldn't be able to pierce their armour at all. Some specific examples:
<ul><li> In <em>Gradius II</em>, the Crystal Core could render itself unbeatable just by wrapping its tentacles around its weak point. But it doesn't.
</li><li> In <em>Gradius Gaiden</em>, Kraken, the Stage 7 boss, could have made itself near-invulnerable if it kept its arms closed and never used its giant rock attack, which exposes the core barriers on its rear.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>: King Toad in the April's Fools' Day dungeon Super Adventure Box is defeated by first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">smacking the jewel around its neck</a> to loosen shards of gemstone and then dodging its regular attacks until it's preparing to do its devastating tongue lash attack, during which time it will... just sort of stand there with its mouth open... and tossing the gem down its throat, stunning the toad and enabling you to do damage. Rinse and repeat.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a></em>. The second boss is a cleaver-wielding man who kills you instantly if you get close, but mostly keeps his distance. He occasionally lunges at you, which is easy to dodge, and eventually tosses his cleaver at you—it gets stuck in a wall, and he tries to pull it out while you're free to bash his skull open. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But in the epilogue you get to relive the battle from the boss's perspective.

<ul><li> King Dodongo could just keep rolling and not spit fire so Link can't throw bombs in its mouth.
</li><li> Volvagia could just fly around and attack Link with fire and falling boulders, instead of going underground and exposing himself a la Whack-a-Mole.
</li><li> Morpha could stay under the water and not make itself an obvious target for the Longshot.

If one of them simply left the room, the remaining one would be invincible. Or they could stay on opposite sides of Link when he's reflecting their magic spells.
</li><li> Almost every fight with Ganondorf has him shooting energy balls that he and Link end up smacking back and forth, marking the series' proud tradition of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">Tennis Boss</a>.

</li><li> Gohdan from the same game will also gladly sneeze out bombs and arrows, should you happen to run out of either. In his case, however, it's justified as Gohdan is meant to test Link's <em>skill</em>, not however much ammo he has.

<ul><li> Agahnim can be killed by deflecting his projectiles just like before, but since he's vulnerable to the sword directly this time, it's not the most efficient method.
</li><li> Onox, the final boss, falls into this in his third phase: he's a flying dragon, and his sole weak spot is his forehead that is too far away for Link to hit from the ground with his sword. Similar to Sigma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em>, he makes the forehead vulnerable by slamming his claws into the ground, when he could use his hard-to-dodge flame attack instead.

But he has other attacks that Link can't deflect, including homing red energy balls. Alas, by the time he's learned to just stick to the unexploitable attacks (after at least <strong>eight times</strong> of fighting him), Link already has a weapon capable of one-shotting him.

</li><li> If Stallord's head would bother to fly <em>above</em> the arena's highest Spinner tracks, Link would be unable to reach him.
</li><li> If Blizzeta remained in the air during the second phase of her fight, she would remain out of reach of Link's Ball and Chain, and could just crush him with ice blocks.

He'd be unbeatable if he didn't keep swinging his swords into the floor so violently that he gets stuck, allowing you to rip his arms off, take one of his swords, and beat him up with it.
</li><li> Fraaz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em> becomes one of these after he breaks the torches you use to stun him. If he only stuck to one element — fire or ice — he'd be invincible, but you can use the residue of one attack as a "torch" while he's charging the other one.
</li><li> The Knucklemaster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">A Link Between Worlds</a></em> is only vulnerable when you avoid its punching attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">causing it to smash into the wall</a> and reveal its weak point. If it would stick to the attacks where it slams the floor, it would be impossible to kill.

Less so in fights with officers where you can also just beat them in a straight up fight, with the Tactical Suicide weakpoint smashes only serving to speed the process up. The bosses play it completely straight, being vulnerable to an item but only before or after certain attacks in their arsenal. Notably, the bosses are hated for the fact that unlike other examples of this trope, they can go for long periods of time before using said attacks. Where other examples of this trope note that a boss would be unbeatable if they didn't commit Tactical Suicide, that's a very real possibility in this game.
<ul><li> King Dodongo must be fed bombs to expose the weakpoint, but only when it's charging up his mega fire ball attack.
</li><li> Gohma must be shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">in the eye</a>, but unlike other Gohmas in the Zelda series, this one closes his eye before the arrow reaches it. So you have to wait until it starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam">firing lasers</a>, causing its eye to turn blue and bug out.
</li><li> Manhandla's stalks must be cut off with the boomerang, but only once it's shot seeds out of its mouths.
</li><li> Argorok sticks his tail out and it starts glowing blue whenever he shoots fire or gusts of wind, leaving you free to hookshot him out of the sky. Unlike the others this happens often enough it's hard to notice that he's an example of this, but he does have a few attacks that don't leave his tail vulnerable.
</li><li> Ganon has attacks from all the previous bosses. The very same attacks that made weakpoints vulnerable on said bosses. In his second phase he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">should</a></em> be vulnerable all the time. And yet, he's only vulnerable to the arrows after he tries to rush you down, which is only one of his attacks.
</li><li> <em>Hyrule Warriors Legends</em> doesn't have much smarter bosses; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">the Helmaroc King</a> must be smashed with the hammer after it pecks into the ground just like the game he came from.
</li><li> And of course, Phantom Ganon; his first phase has you deflecting magic like so many bosses before him, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">him</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">self</a>, and thus you have to deflect it with your sword like usual. The second phase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averts this</a>, forcing you to go behind him to attack instead.

Given that hes smart enough to speak Common Tongue (the arrival of his flunkies is signalled by him saying "Finally! Kill this one!"), one would think he wouldve learned not to do that after the first time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MalditaCastilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MalditaCastilla">Maldita Castilla</a></em>, Crazy Quixote is invulnerable except when he jumps through the burning ceiling and temporarily catches on fire. His attack pattern is a fixed cycle, but if he left out that one move, he'd be unstoppable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MediEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MediEvil2">MediEvil 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinosaursAreDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinosaursAreDragons">Tyrannosaurus Wrecks</a> has an attack where he simply stands perfectly still and summons two baby dinosaurs to attack you. He also makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakpoint">weakpoint</a> behind his head <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis">incredibly obvious</a>, giving Dan the cue to run up his tail, along his spine, and attack it.
</li><li> The Count suffers from both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>; he starts the fight using attacks that can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">reflected back at him</a> with mirrors, before switching to full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a> (you have to use the mirrors to burn him with sunlight).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">The Ripper</a> will sometimes stop attacking Dan in order to attack Kiya instead. This is the only time Dan can damage him.
</li><li> When fighting Palethorn's Cruiser, the only time it can be damaged is when it flies past firing missiles, allowing Dan to get behind it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">Attack Its Weak Point</a>. If Palethorn only used his machinegun attack (which lets him stay at one end of the arena), he'd be unbeatable.
</li></ul></li><li> Several bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> are guilty of this - and most of them are piloted by, guess who, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">the Bonnes</a>. Teisel's Marlwolf hurls powerful homing blasts, but every so often he'll turn away and open up a small hatch where the armor is thinner. His Servbots use it to lob hovering explosives; judging by Teisel's repeated howls of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">CLOSE THE HATCH!!</a>, it just doesn't occur to them not to.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em>, Wolf Sigma, the final boss (Sigma fused with a canine armor), keeps slamming his hands onto the ground. They can be used as platforms. If only he didn't bring them up to head level while X was standing on them, he wouldn't be asking for a Rolling Shield to the face!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em>, if you take too long fighting Maverick Zero, he'll pull out his most notorious move: Genmu Zero, a slash that covers the whole screen, kills you on impact, and will be repeated endlessly until it connects. There's no obvious reason he bothers using anything else.
</li><li> In the final fight of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em>, Dr. Weil can only be hit when his core is exposed to attack. If he waited the two minutes without attacking, he'd be able to destroy Area Zero without Zero messing up his plans. Then again, he is a vengeful, hateful psychopath and touching down on Area Zero would destroy him too, so he's probably getting what little satisfaction he can get in seeing Zero die before him before he gets turned into a giant crater. Also, the final boss of the first game, Copy X. He destroys the majority of the floor with a set of spiked pillars that remain there for you to wall-jump off when he uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">Seraph Armor</a>. Without them, Zero wouldn't be able to hit him and Copy X could just laser-spam him to death. And sure, he has a few tricks like being able to fire restraining rings that can and will cause a cheap kill into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> if fought at A Rank or higher has him command those pillars to strike the small floor area, but he's just making things needlessly complicated for himself.
</li><li> Gate, one of the last bosses of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">Mega Man X6</a></em>, is normally completely invincible to your attacks, but to attack you he throws energy balls that can have one of several different effects. When you destroy these, their pieces scatter in six directions, and they can hit Gate to damage him. At low enough health, he will eventually start using a purple slash that can temporarily destroy the platforms you have to stand on, but he won't stop throwing energy balls. Granted, even the scattered pieces can still hurt and kill <em>you</em> if the timing's messed up, but like Copy-X Gate is making this much more difficult than it needs to be.
</li></ul></li><li> The very first boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMessenger2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMessenger2018">The Messenger (2018)</a></em>, the Leaf Monster, is invincible while its leaves are still on its body. Its one and only attack is to take them off and throw them at you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">leav</a>-ing it vulnerable. If it ever gave up on doing that and decided to just try punching you or something, you'd have no chance against it. Then, as if it wasn't stupid enough already, after you do some damage to it, it decides to move up to the top of the screen and rain leaves down on you from above. If it just stayed up there where you can't reach it, again you'd have no chance to win, but it always comes back down eventually.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a> 3</em> has the final boss Rootmars. For an alien mastermind with a brain as big as a tank, it doesn't think to just toss away the Slug it's holding in its claw, <strong>even as you climb into it and blast away at its exposed brain</strong>. This makes the battle that much easier.

<ul><li> If Kraid would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">keep his mouth shut</a>, he would be invulnerable. Justified in that he must be deliberately provoked into doing this by shooting him in the eyes, making him roar in pain. (In the first game he doesn't have a specific weak point and Samus can shoot him anywhere.)
</li><li> Specific to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> If Phantoon would stay phased out and shooting at Samus instead of periodically materializing in the middle of the arena, he'd be untouchable. Though Phantoon may not be able to stay phased permanently - it may be like how whales have to surface every so often to breathe; they'd never get harpooned if they just stayed deep underwater, but it isn't possible.
</li><li> Spore Spawn would be invincible if it never opened to reveal its vulnerable insides. Justified in that this creature probably isnt sentient.
</li><li> If Crocomire never opened his mouth to roar, he would be untouchable. But he could also possibly qualify as a "dumb animal" driven solely by instinct.
</li></ul></li><li> If the eponymous boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> didn't squirt out pools of pure Phazon, Samus wouldnt be able to use the only weapon that works against it. Justified in that scanning it reveals that it's not exactly a decision: the boss has to expel it as a waste product.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>, Metroid Prime is back as the final boss, Dark Samus, and is still only vulnerable to Phazon — which it shoots regularly at Samus, who can absorb and weaponize it for herself. Apparently it didn't learn from its mistakes. Justified again as scanning Dark Samus reveals that it's dangerous unstable from absorbing too much Phazon, and <em>has</em> to expel it to survive.
</li><li> Mogenar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> can only be damaged by using the Hyper Beam to destroy the sockets on his body... which means you have to blow up the red orbs inside the sockets first... of a boss whose tactical stupidity is resorting to the charge attack that lets you shoot the orb on its back.
</li></ul></li><li> All of the monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series can be struck at any time, but some of them do things that aren't terribly bright and leave them especially open for abuse.
<ul><li> The Nargacuga has a tail slam, that while powerful, will lodge its tail spikes in the ground for a good amount of time, leaving it far more vulnerable then its other attacks do.
</li><li> The Duramboros occasionally does a huge spinning leap into the air and comes smashing down (which hurts about as much as you'd expect from having a 18 foot tall dinosaur land on you), but it takes several seconds to get up, leaving you free to attack its tail, which is a weak point and usually too high in the air to get a clear shot at otherwise.
</li><li> The Agnaktor will commonly dig into the ground to attack you. The drawback is that its hard magma armor melts once it's done, making it prone to breaking. The Glacial Agnaktor has the opposite problem: its ice melts due to prolonged exposure to the elements, so it digs to restore the makeshift armor.
</li><li> One of the most glaring examples comes from the Zamtrios, who in response to having its ice armor broken, will inflate itself like a balloon and start trying to sluggishly bounce and roll on you with its bloated body, which is far slower then its standard mode of attack. Its whole body becomes a weak spot during this time, plus it'll occasionally break through the ice and get stuck if it bounces around too much, leaving it even more open for abuse then usual. This is less of a problem for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">Tigerstripe Zamtrios</a>, who can inflate and deflate at will, and is very aggressive while inflated.
</li><li> Ceadeus and Goldbeard Ceadeus both have this problem regarding the Dragonator, a super powerful weapon situated in only one point of the arena, meaning you have to time activating it perfectly for whenever it's in range. Or you would if it didn't drop everything it was doing, swim to the opposite side and then swim all the way to the side with the Dragonator and wait there for a while for the Dragonator to attack it directly in the face.
</li></ul></li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsUnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsUnite">Nicktoons Unite!</a></em>, you meet ghost prison guards who are intangible except when attacking. There's also similar fighters later on, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny</a> gets the ability to turn intangible himself and is therefore able to hurt intangible opponents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Defense System</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Gepetto</a>, robotic guardian of the Junkyard, has the following attacks: fire a continuous laser stream from each fingertip, fire homing missiles, slam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom">its floating hands</a> on the arena, spawn endless robot drones with lightning and magic bullet attacks, a <em>gigantic</em> mouth laser, and... spawn bombs. Not <em>armed</em> bombs, just bombs. Which just sit there until you grab one and toss it. And it spawns them immediately before <em>opening its mouth to charge up for the giant laser</em>. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Grimoire Weiss</a> cracks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">wise</a> at "such an obvious weak point."
</li><li> If Fire Cracker (an armored truck) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightStriker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightStriker">Night Striker</a></em> didn't open up its rear to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">unleash a barrage of homing missiles</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar">Inter Gray</a> would never be able to hurt it by shooting its unarmored insides.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em> remakes usually make you work for your attack opportunities, but one notable example in the first game — Marbus — fights by flooding the area with some mooks and then taking potshots at you. While you can, if you're lucky, knock him out of the air on your own, he also tries to swoop down at you, invariably giving you a chance to beat the stuffing out of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoituLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoituLove">Noitu Love</a></em> lives and breathes this trope, with nearly every boss in the game opening themselves to attack or have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">explicitly labeled weak point</a>. Actually, all of the games made by the author revel in this trope. As seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Gj2aGJKyI&amp;feature=channel">in this review of all his games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> and to a certain extent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle">No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</a></em>, if you think about it. All of the bosses in the first game are actually completely invincible or extremely evasive most of the time. There are usually only small windows of opportunity where the boss is actually vulnerable to your attacks; learning when these windows appear and exploiting them is pretty much the only way to win the game. In the second game, you can attack whenever for most bosses, but attacking at the wrong time can cause you to get hit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, Orochi is only vulnerable after you get his various heads drunk and you can only truly damage him after knocking out all eight of his heads. To get him drunk, you draw the sake below him into his mouth when he roars, and he roars after you thwart his attacks. He cannot learn to avoid this strategy all <strong>three</strong> times he is fought. Nearly all the other bosses in <em>Okami</em> fit this trope as well. At least mythology establishes that Orochi is an alcoholic, justifying his inability to stop drinking sake.
<ul><li> Also, Ninetails. In the first part of the battle, drawing lightning to her sword when she lifts it up for a charged attack is the only way to make her vulnerable.
</li><li> When doing a ranged attack, Blight throws <em>all</em> his swords at you, including the one that the Blight entity is actually within, and it's very visually distinct from the rest because it is glowing blue. If Blight stuck to just melee and dash attacks, it wouldn't be <em>fine</em> - Amaterasu has Blight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a>, namely time-slow - but it'd certainly reduce the number of opportunities to power-slash the sword out of the sky and wail on it.
</li><li> Armoured Dokuro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden">Ōkamiden</a></em>, an enemy which isn't technically a boss but functions very much like one, is <em>supposed</em> to be this. Its main vulnerability is that upon spitting a fire, ice or lightning ball at you, you can power slash it back into the big skeleton's face and knock it unconscious for a short time, letting you shred its normally concealed health gem. The downside is that it randomly selects attacks, so it can take an agonisingly long time to get around to spitting the actual fireball - and the first one goes to removing its helmet. The end result is usually the player shouting at the DS to demand it commit tactical suicide sometime today.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenotopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenotopia">Phoenotopia</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> Bubbles is impervious to attacks from the outside (when not stunned), and can only be harmed/stunned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb">feeding it a bomb</a> when it tries to bite you.
</li><li> Both of the golem bosses charge at you after a while, ramming into the wall and becoming temporarily disabled and open to attack. Before they turn back on, you can push them over a trapdoor with repeated hits, and then open the trapdoor to drop them into a pit. (The second one makes this harder by covering the floor with bombs as it charges, though.)
</li><li> The Kobold boss protects itself with a force field most of the time, but has to open it up to charge its death ball attack. It can be stunned, dropping the force field entirely, by throwing a javelin into its chest while it's doing so. Granted, its other attacks are easy to dodge, whereas this one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">unavoidable and about twice as powerful as the rest</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a>:</em> Sometimes the Champion Blue's Blastoise would use Rain Dance...even when the opponent right at the field is an electric type pokemon that knows Thunder, a superpowerful electric type attack with low accuracy that becomes maximum whenever Rain Dance is activated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">The boss fight</a> starts once you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">destroy GLaDOS's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">morality core</a>, which prevents her from trying to kill you with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">neurotoxin</a>. GLaDOS notes that a side effect of the destruction is that she can't turn her self-defense rocket turret off anymore. The turret, of course, is necessary to beat her, by redirecting the rockets through portals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">double subverts</a> the trope while also justifying it and hanging lampshades:
<ul><li> When you confront GLaDOS again, she's taken care to keep you from using the same tactics to beat her as in the first game. However, unbeknownst to her, you've already sabotaged her defenses, and the mainframe helpfully provides a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">third option</a> to the ensuing stalemate.
</li><li> At the start of the final battle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wheatley</span> informs you that he has analyzed the first game's climax and set up an arena with no portal surfaces, and thus no way to fight him while the neurotoxin kills you. However, he took the extra step of equipping himself with bombs (and reconfigurable shields so you can't hit him with the bombs), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">forgot about the tube of Conversion Gel running through the room</a>. One broken tube later, and you gain the means with which to defeat him. What's more, after you hit him with a bomb for the first time, he tries to stop using them but discovers that the mechanism for doing so has been damaged. But thats not to say he made that much of a mistake, as he did make sure <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to rig more bombs to the Stalemate Button in the event that he lost.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Brain Tank</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kochamara</a> bosses have the most blatant cases of this. The former's only weak spot is its underside, which it reveals for a <em>looong</em> time when rearing up for a charge attack, and the latter has an attack that drains its shield into a weak beam-thing that you can reflect back or dodge while blasting him.
</li><li> If the Butcher never did a single vertical slash his arm would never get stuck in the ground, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">giving a way to reach</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">his head.</a> If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raz's imagined version of his dad</span> didn't throw spiked flaming bowling pins at you during the second fight you'd have no way to damage the Butcher in the second battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>:
<ul><li> King Hippo. If he never opened his mouth, he'd literally be unbeatable. This doesn't apply in the Wii version, though, since hooking his stomach when he jabs provides Stars for Star Punches, which don't discriminate.
</li><li> Everybody would have a better chance against Little Mac if they didn't have tells, stop to taunt, etc. Of course, they <em>do</em> recognize this in time for Title Defense mode, shoring up some of their vulnerable spots (and sometimes opening up whole new cans of this).
</li></ul></li><li> If the Snagglebeast had figured out that it was too heavy to cross the bridge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em>, it would have successfully finished off the duo.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995">Rayman</a></em> game has Mr. Sax, who is defeated by having Rayman punch his musical notes back towards him, and Skops, who launches a homing projectile that hones in on Rayman's fists; time your punches just right, and they'll fly into him instead.
</li><li> Ditto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType">R-Type</a></em>.
</li><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> attacks by turning into a fireball and diving into the party, during which he is invincible. But he also helpfully floats in front of the platform the party is standing on in between these attacks, only occasionally casting a spell, leaving the player free to slash him with the Mana Sword. Justified in that the boss isn't trying to kill <em>you</em>, he's there to destroy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Mana Fortress</span>. You're just getting in the way when he gets close to try to destroy it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RWBYGrimmEclipse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RWBYGrimmEclipse">RWBY: Grimm Eclipse</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both Ursa Minor and Ursa Major perform a variation of this. Their strongest attack is their ground slam, which sends out rocks in a circle around them and can deplete nearly all of your Aura if it connects. After performing this attack, Ursas get stunned, leaving themselves open for a combo or two. Now, exploiting this isn't necessary to defeat them, as you can still shoot and beat them up the old-fashioned way. That, however, will take much longer, since in a normal state, Ursas only receive 1/4 of your attacks' damage, plus guard automatically.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost every boss features this. If the second one didn't try to stomp you, you couldn't shoot its feet. If the bird didn't dive bomb you, you couldn't climb onto it, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame">The Simpsons Game</a></em>, where the Simpsons discover they're in a video game and use this knowledge to their advantage. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> comes back to bite them in one battle against aliens, when Bart points out that the UFO fires four times and exposes its weak point. The aliens immediately start to wonder why they do that, and resolve not to do so anymore, making them completely invulnerable as they rampage through Springfield. The Simpsons get annoyed enough that they go confront God about it.
</li><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyblazer">Skyblazer</a></em>. If he didn't try to punch you with his massive arm that you can use as a platform, you'd run out of magic far before he'd take enough damage to die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Something" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Something">Something</a> series</em>
<ul><li> If Von Frog II didn't spawn his toad minions when you fought him in <em>Something</em>, fighting him when his saucer rises higher into the air would be impossible.
</li><li> If Monkey Kong didn't toss barrels at Luigi during the phase where Munchers are a prominent obstacle, he would be impossible to beat.
</li><li> Von Frog II's machine in <em>Something Else</em> shoots stompable ball projectiles at Luigi. Like the toads the saucer spawns in <em>Something</em>, Luigi can use them to reach the cockpit of the machine. If the projectiles weren't there, Von Toad II would be harder to beat.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>: Many of Robotnik/Eggman's machines are like this, especially in the later games, where he has attacks that can hurt Sonic without going into harm's way, but he does so anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">He has an IQ of 300</a>.
<ul><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> is a huge mecha with a small hit area, and a claw that completely covers it. If Robotnik just walked, he would be invincible (or at least extremely hard - he has a minuscule hit zone during his walk animation and everything else kills Sonic). Instead, he jumps, making his claw sway to regain his balance.
<ul><li> The Oil Ocean boss has no reason to surface during the fight because Eggman's craft doesn't have any weapons directly attached to it. He attacks by launching a snake-like weapon with a sharp point on the end and a laser cannon that emerges from the oil. Yet he does, and gets smacked.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> has a ton of these.
<ul><li> The only way to damage the mid-boss of Carnival Night Zone is to let its floating spiked disc do all the work (you just have to expose its core by jumping at the main body). However, this is not your greatest worry in this fight - the spiked disc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaUrgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaUrgency">is constantly destroying what little precious ground you have to stand on</a>. If you time your hits wrong, the disc will rob you of your platforms before it destroys itself.
</li><li> Likewise, the battle with Eggman in Carnival Night Zone comes down to being able to jump on him when he floats down to pick up the grounding orb he uses to generate a magnetic field (if he had a way to raise it back up to his ship without descending then he would be unstoppable). Once again, however, time proves to be your greatest adversary. The second act of Carnival Night is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a>, and if you used up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">too much of your allotted 10 minutes just getting to the boss</a>, you will lose a life. And this particular contraption of Eggman's gives Sonic some of the shortest, least frequent windows of opportunity to attack. Perhaps the good doctor had the right idea after all...
</li><li> The Flying Battery miniboss can only attack you with its oversized spiked flails. It doesn't try to think up a better way to deal with blue hedgehogs on its head other than bashing its own head in. Even assuming that it's not mechanically capable of low lateral swipes over the top of its head, it would still be able to win by doing nothing, thus keeping Sonic busy long enough for Robotnik to finish carrying out his evil plan.
</li><li> The last boss in Flying Battery will hang below the girder Sonic is standing on and slowly sidle side to side, igniting its flamethrower whenever Sonic is standing above it. The only time you can damage it is when he arbitrarily swings his machine above the girder for no reason other than to get hit.
</li><li> In the Lava Reef Zone boss fight, Eggman will continue to shoot spike balls while inclining the surface such that they roll into his own ship.
</li><li> The "Death Ball" boss in Death Egg act 2 can only be damaged by making it hit itself with the little weird spiked things it drops occasionally. Worse, there's only two ways to actually do that, and they both rely on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew">Gravity Screw</a> device Eggman installed in the arena for no apparent reason.
</li><li> The first phase of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> can only be won by tricking it into hitting itself with its own heat-seeking missiles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>
<ul><li> The Egg Viper. During the first part of the fight, Eggman regularly uses a charged laser attack that requires him to hold still with the cockpit wide open for several seconds; most players will never even see him get to the actual attack. He later switches to a slightly more direct attack that involves shooting a very platform-like projectile that Sonic can easily ride straight back for the hit.
</li><li> Also, E-101 MKII. He simply bats away all your shots or strafes out of the way, but completely exposes himself every time he attempts to impale you. If he never charged, he'd be invincible.
</li><li> The Egg Hornet. If all Eggman ever did was shoot those little missiles at you, and never stuck himself in the ground trying to hit you with his ship, Sonic would wear out and eventually get hit.
</li><li> Chaos isn't immune: in his 2 form, he bounces around as a giant ball in one attack, and covers most of the floor for a couple of seconds in another. Why would he ever need to do that stretch-punch thing? Well... because if he didn't, he couldn't stop moving afterwards, giving Knuckles a chance to punch his brain.
</li><li> And his 4 form is worse; the only time he's vulnerable <em>isn't even associated with an attack</em>. If he'd stop just surfacing and sitting there, Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles would eventually lose.
</li><li> Chaos 6 has this problem as well. If Eggman had stayed out of the fight and wasn't flying around dropping bombs, Chaos would have been impossible to beat.
</li></ul></li><li> The Egg Dealer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em> is one of the most exemplary examples of this trope. It's a slot machine mech that Shadow can control by hitting its reels, causing it to attack itself with missiles, bombs, or even grant Shadow invincibility with Shadow Fever. The last one really makes you wonder why Eggman even programmed that in.
</li><li> Iblis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic 2006</a></em>. Silver has to kill it by reflecting its thrown rocks back at it, preferably before it manages to close the distance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaUrgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaUrgency">slam the platform three times and drop you to your death.</a> Unfortunately, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I.

This actually happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Pokecapn</a> in the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix">Knuckles Chaotix</a></em>, what stage the player goes to next is determined by a roulette-like device with an image of each of the five stages on it. As each stage is complete, the images are replaced with 1, 2, 3, X, and 4; once all five stages are completed, the roulette is used to fight Metal Sonic. Whatever number the roulette lands on during the fight determines the attack, but landing on the X causes damage to Metal Sonic. To Metal Sonic's credit, when there's only one number and the X left, X causes the attack and the number defeats him, in case the player is able to time the roulette at that point.

<ul><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Ghost Titan</a> from <em>Sonic Rush Adventure</em> is already one of the most frustrating bosses in all of Sonic history, he would literally be literally invincible if he'd just stop shooting and only punched.

<ul><li> The final boss of <em>Episode I</em> at E.G.G. Station is a throwback to the final boss of <em>Sonic 2</em> with a twist: after taking a certain amount of damage, the electrics in Eggman's robot start to short out and he becomes untouchable directly. The only way to expose him is to fling his detachable spiked arms back to him with a homing attack as they float down after being fired (after which Eggman's entire machine will stall and give you a chance to dole out some damage proper).
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland">Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island</a></em> can only be hit when he enters the platform Sonic is standing on, which he does on every phase (hitting him is how you move between phases). This includes one phase where the boss ship is not even present at the platform <em>until</em> Sonic has to hit him.
</li><li> Heavy Gunner from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> fires three rockets at a time during its fight. You have to avoid the red missiles but the blue ones can be bounced back to Heavy Gunner and take out his Eggrobo entourage (before eventually destroying his helicopter, ending the fight). The blue rockets are his only weakness yet he keeps firing them.
</li></ul></li><li> Two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> in the Flash RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny">Sonny</a></em> do this. Omen has a move that makes both his next attack and yours much more deadly; if you already have a shield in place, you can hit him for massive damage while absorbing his attack. Dr. Herregods is even more egregious; he has one million hit points, and once you've knocked off a thousand or so he will heal himself for <em>two million</em> hit points. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Too bad you have a move that reverses damage and healing.</span>
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>, DJ Octavio, can only be damaged by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">shooting his fists or missiles back at him</a>. Naturally, he never considers forgoing those attacks and sticking with the weapons in his arsenal that <em>can't</em> be used against him.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> video games <em>Battle for Bikini Bottom</em>, <em>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</em> and <em>Truth or Square</em> there is at least one boss that does this. In BFBB, every single boss does it except for the final boss's second form. Sandy Robot should stop using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> move, and kick the player's ass with the "clothesline" move, and Patrick Robot is a real idiot in spinning around until he gets dizzy. King Neptune should stop using his easy to dodge sniper move. The giant Plankton in <em>Creature from the Krusty Krab</em> deserves special mention; he just stands there with his hands on the buildings, waiting for you to hit them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a></em> is full of this. In the first game, Doctor Shemp would have lived if he didn't expose his back when he attacked, and Metalhead combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>; he could have easily stayed in the first area after you destroyed his power poles and would have been invincible. In the second game, to defeat Crush, you need to attack him, then let him bring the ceiling down on himself. It's somewhat subverted, as the rocks can hurt you also. Halfway subverted when he uses that against you, chasing you for a bit before smashing the ground. In the third game, ALL THE BOSSES are like this. The first four deserve special mention, as your ally helps you to hurt the boss. Of course the boss doesn't pay attention to the powerful kangaroo, the flying penguin, the yeti or the laser-gun armed monkey. The true final battle gives you a UFO, while the boss is just waiting for you to get on it. Mind you, the entire area is filled with purple acid, save for a small platform.
<ul><li> Metalhead may be somewhat justified in leaving the first area; since those poles are power poles, he may require them to operate at a combat-capable level (or at all, since destroying all the poles in the level causes him to promptly topple over dead).
</li><li> And fair's fair to Dr. Shemp, unlike most examples of this trope, he does learn from his mistakes, and each subsequent exposure of his back is shorter harder to bait from him. If he'd had one or two more hit points, it's possible he may have subverted the trope and become invincible. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">he doesn't</a>.
</li><li> The battle with Ineptune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroAHerosTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroAHerosTail">A Hero's Tail</a></em> is a prime example of this. Ineptune's only weakness is being rammed by Spyro after she either looks down after missing a shot at him, or laughs after hitting him. Neither of these tactics serve any benefit to her.
</li><li> The two battles with Red are the embodiment of this trope. In the first battle, Red repeatedly conjures up exploding boxes which almost never hurt Spyro and are the ONLY way to hurt Red. In the second battle, he turns into Mecha Red, a robot version of himself, and decides that the best place to fight Spyro is in a room FULL of weaponry that he designed, all of which is capable of hurting him, and his former captive is outside in the control room making this weaponry available to Spyro CONSTANTLY.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some bosses will attack you with weapons that can be destroyed and converted into collectible bombs, even if bombs are the boss's only weakness, and without a constant supply you would quickly be left helpless. One boss attacks by constantly shooting floating barrels. It's almost impossible to be hit by these barrels, but they can be shot to yield health-pickups.
</li><li> In addition, <em>Star Fox 64</em> has the boss of Sector Y. He's quick and maneuverable, and since he's one of the few bosses that can be hurt without attacking a weak point, those are its greatest strengths. And every so often he flies to a platform in the middle of the arena and just stands there shooting at you, making him an easy target.
<ul><li> Said boss, the Shogun, will <em>begin to heal</em> if left alone long enough on his ship.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered">Sundered</a></em>: The boss Hysteria is a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank">Spider Tank</a> whose weak points are too high for Eshe to reach. He would be impossible to defeat if not for the fact that one of his attacks (in which he smashes the ground with a giant hammer) will launch Eshe high enough into the air to attack any of his weak points if it misses her. The same attack also throws debris into the air, creating temporary floating platforms for Eshe to climb.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>: Bowser tends to be a big offender:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>: Bowser mostly commits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>, placing an axe at the end of his bridge even after seven fakes fell to their doom. But for this trope, his habit of making big slow jumps in the air can be incredibly helpful to the player, especially in later worlds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>: It was bad enough that Wart keeps a machine in his room that constantly provides his weakness, he has to keep opening his mouth to shoot bubbles, providing a very easy weak spot to be exploited.
<ul><li> Somewhat justified: the machine in question, the Dream Machine, belonged to the Subcon people before Wart stole it. The machine appears to be sentient, as once it senses Mario's group approaching Wart, it chooses to help them out. Still doesn't explain why Wart didn't lock it up, unless he needed to be in close proximity to ensure it would work as he wanted it to.

</li><li> Pom Pom uses doppelgangers to aid her in her fight. You have to hit the real deal in order to damage her. The trope comes in when she decides to stand out from her doppelgangers for no apparent reason by having a different colored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuumaShuriken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuumaShuriken">Fuuma Shuriken</a> than the clones, as well as a few other differences.

</li><li> Pretty much all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> boss battles either work off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, it's played straight in about half of his fights against Bowser Jr. In most of the later fights, he becomes aware of the fact that he's vulnerable when not inside his shell, so he retreats into it whenever it seems like Mario might jump on him. (You can tell when he's doing this when his bandanna is over his mouth) Unfortunately, he throws Koopa shells at you after every time he does this, which you can throw back at him to flip him over helplessly. <em>Not</em> the best compensation for a new tactic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU">New Super Mario Bros.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy">Meat Boy</a></em>, many bosses do this. For example, the boss of Chapter 1: The Forest, Lil' Slugger, will chase you through a sea of sawblades, and ultimately commit suicide in a sawblade trap. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Little Horn in Chapter 4: Hell will smash his head into the small platform you stand on. If you dodge it, Little Horn gets a bump on his head and is damaged. Two more times and he's dead.

The turtles can't hurt the mecha directly; they have to throw Foot soldiers at it. If Shredder stopped sending his mooks in, he would have all the time in the world to simply pick the turtles off with his guns. To be fair, at least the exact type of mooks you have to use as ammo changes with the difficulty level: easy has the normal variety, normal has the ones that throw shurikens and hard has the variety that block most of your attacks and can only thrown reliably by hitting them with a running tackle first, which can be tricky to connect with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em>, the final boss' second form uses <em>only</em> ranged attacks, including a screen-filling beam which can take a non-blocking player down in less time than it takes to read this sentence. If the player hangs around the bottom of the screen, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Gaea</span> responds by getting close enough for Ark to slash. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That may be intentional, though: the boss does, at the beginning of said combat, explicitly say that it's taking a physical form to make the fight fairer.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has several eyes on his body that must be taken out to progress the fight, but can only be damaged while open. The one on his forehead stays closed almost all of the time, and only opens in order to fire his Phantasmal Deathray; if he never used the Deathray, you wouldn't have a way to beat him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureAdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureAdventureGame">Treasure Adventure Game</a></em>, several bosses suffer from this. However one robot subverts it: once you've attacked it twice when it exposes its weak spot, it changes its programming to not expose it any more.
</li><li> It would be easier to list <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory">An Untitled Story</a></em> bosses that don't stop in their tracks and practically yell "HIT ME! HIT ME!". There are two.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unworthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unworthy">Unworthy</a></em>, Gaston, Heir of Ambition has an attack where he jumps to the platform off-screen and begins shooting ice arrows straight down. During that time, he's completely invulnerable, and you can only wait until the attack ends. It makes sense he has to recover, but unclear why he has to come back down to the ground to do so. Even if he activates this attack while near death, he chooses to extend it by firing two such arrows at once for the final volley, and then come down, rather then simply staying back up. Presumably, he's literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">too ambitious to consider such a cowardly move</a>.
<ul><li> It's equally unclear why for his normal attacks, he always stops a short while before reaching the edge of the arena, giving you just enough space to roll behind him, and get a couple of hits in while he's shooting in the wrong direction.
</li><li> Amandil, Father of Darkness fights you in an arena divides in half by a beam that cannot be crossed, except through using a Spirit Bow. Nevertheless, he occasionally teleports in right next to you to attack with a staff, even though he has several ranged attacks and is far safer at range. He even does it when you are blinded by a previous attack, and so basically incapable of either shooting at him, or dodging his shots well, yet still able to dish out damage in close quarters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Councillor Vay Hek, the boss of Earth, is invulnerable until he raises his faceplate to scream propaganda at you.
</li><li> Sargas Ruk, the final boss of Saturn, is completely invulnerable until he begins to launch his deadliest attacks, after which various parts of his armor open up (presumably to vent heat), leaving him wide-open to attack.
</li><li> The Ropalolyst is only vulnerable to attack after being stunned and forced to fight on the ground, which requires ramming it into super charged energy pillars in its arena....except the pillars (well conduits) don't charge on their own. They only get overcharged when the Ropalolyst <em>shoots at them with a giant death ray</em>. There's also elements of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BosssArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BosssArenaIdiocy">Bosss Arena Idiocy</a>, as it can only be fought in an area with the precise set of equipment needed to defeat it. Unlike the above two bosses, though, there is a justification for both of these tropes - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the arena is implied to be below Alad V's command center, so the Ropalolyst is there to ensure that he follows through on his debts</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand">Wario Land</a></em> bosses tend to spend a lot of time invulnerable, so when you get an opening, it's usually this trope at work. Some bosses, including the final bosses of the first and fourth games, even give you throwable objects without which they would be unbeatable.

<ul><li> Rollnratl would be invincible if he didn't slam his head into the ground in his first phase, throw only the red missiles which explode on contact, as opposed to missiles which could be stood on and stuck in the ground in his second phase, and summon two satellites which could <em>also</em> be stood on in his third form.
</li><li> Hot Roderick would be invincible if he didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">throw wrenches and tires at Wario,</a> which he can punch back at his engine, making it go kaput and disabling the flame keeping Wario from punching his engine.
</li><li> Bloomsday combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>; if he didn't summon Bandineros with his sucking attack, Wario wouldn't have anything to throw at him to stun him and eventually knock him into the lake surrounding his arena.
</li><li> Large Fry is a <em><strong>triple</strong></em> offender: he couldn't be hurt if he: A. didn't slam the ground and summon bags of enemies, which could be thrown into his mouth, B.spit out a bomb, when this happens enough times, and C. <em>just not eat everything that comes too close to his gob.</em>
</li><li> The Shake King would be invincible if he didn't do the charging attack that allows Wario to stomp on him, causing to trip and get stuck in the wall due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">his helmet,</a> get rammed so that he falls out and get thrown into the ceiling for incredibly high damage. For extra points, he <em>continues</em> this even after he revives for the second phase!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em>: With shields that are too thick to break through and you only controlling one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Platinum Robo</span>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jergingha</span> might've been completely invincible... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if one of his attacks didn't involve shooting out other robots that your team can hijack and use to form the giant Unite Morphs needed to break through the shields</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both C'thun and Yogg-Saron, the game's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, employ attacks that swallow or consume players, but also place them in a location where they can inflict damage on the normally invulnerable boss. In the latter case, you have to use the portals yourself.
</li><li> Icehowl in the Crusader's Coliseum is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">Bullfight Boss</a> who literally charges into walls and stuns himself. Justified, as yetis aren't all that smart.
<ul><li> Crush of the Brawler's Guild has a similar strategy to Icehowl.
</li></ul></li><li> Hakkar the Blood God drains the life from the raiders, healing himself to nearly maximum health. However, all over the arena there are winged serpents that leave a cloud of poison when they die. If the players poison themselves, Hakkar drains the poison from their blood.
</li><li> Baron Ashbury in Shadowfang Keep will occasionally start healing everyone, friend and foe, in the nearby area. To convince the players to let him channel it, he'll hit the entire party with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> spell, necessitating a balancing act between staying alive and keeping him from undoing too much damage. If he had not healed himself, the players would have been in big trouble. Of course, there's an achievement for defeating him without letting him heal.
</li><li> Millie Watt in the Brawler's Guild has the ability to put void zones on the ground, and one type incapacitates you unless you're damaged. By running into the void zones before the latter is used, you can free yourself.
</li><li> A somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example is Ahoo'ru, who protects himself with an impenetrable barrier<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14e1e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14e1e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14e1e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you take longer than two minutes to defeat a Brawler's Guild opponent, a rain of fire sweeps across the arena and kills you</span>. The barrier can be removed by tricking the Avenging Angels into charging him. However, not only do you have to reduce the angels to half health before they charge, but you also have to navigate the shifting lights to reach the orbs that spawn them.
</li><li> On the fourth phase of the fight with Garrosh Hellscream, which is only available on Mythic, you have to trick the fleet into firing an Unstable Iron Star at you, and then use it to interrupt his Unleash Rage attack.
</li><li> Asaad in the Vortex Pinnacle periodically unleashes a powerful lightning storm that would normally almost certainly kill everyone on the platform. However, before doing so, for some unexplained reason he creates what's basically a Faraday cage where players can run and hide to avoid lightning damage.
</li><li> Talixae Flamewreath, the second boss of the Court of Stars has a council of three demons with her and for each one nearby she and the demons have their health and damage doubled. At the start, she has raid boss level health and can easily crush even a tank. But each time the players take out a fel enforcer, she sends one of her demons away to investigate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLaylee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLaylee">Yooka-Laylee</a></em>, in true form to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">its inspiration</a> have all its bosses be this trope:
<ul><li> The Great Rampo would be invincible if he just kept doing the fire breath attack and didn't show his teeth once you got to the top.
</li><li> Brrreeze Blok wouldn't melt as fast if he just <em>stopped moving</em>, keeping him from going over the torches you light behind him, making him melt in addition from you being able to breathe fire due to the Scorchberries in the room.
</li><li> Trev the Tenteyecle would be invincible if he didn't open the eyes on his tentacle when he smashes it onto the floor, as well as opening the hatch to his <em>main</em> eye when this happens.
</li><li> I.N.E.P.T would be impossible to beat if he didn't rush at you in his first phase, allowing Kartos to get a good shot at him, smash into his own mines in his second phase, and used regular missiles as opposed to homing ones.
</li><li> Planette couldn't be hurt if she just floated above the duo and shot at them.
</li><li> Capital B. would be invincible if there weren't two Frostberry plants as well as a bunch of Corplet crates, allowing you to get a good shot at the now-flying boss, and in his third phase where he does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp">Shockwave Stomp</a> using his cane, which eventually gets stuck and allows you a good shot at him. To his credit, at least the former was Dr. Quack's fault, and he at least didn't fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater">Grimy Water</a> he flooded part of the room with in the latter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsTheOathInFelghana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsTheOathInFelghana">Ys: The Oath in Felghana</a></em>. If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chester</span> didn't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> on you, you'd never kill him, as he is invincible until he uses that dash stab attack of his. He's got plenty of other attacks to murder you outright (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">especially the 2nd time you fight him...</a>), he clearly doesn't <em>need</em> that Dash Stab, complete with the "<strong>HIT ME NOW</strong>" sound effect that also telegraphs he's about to do that move.
<ul><li> Similarly, Ernst in <em>Ys VI</em> will usually hit you first when you get close, but takes a moment to recover from his dash attack.

</p><ul><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_586_31-life-lessons-you-can-only-learn-from-video-games/">31 Life Lessons You Can Only Learn From Video Games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an illustration involving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>: "it may take a few tries, but life gets easier once you figure out the patterns."
</li><li> The Omnidroid machines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> can only be hurt by their own claws. That said, the new model is smart enough to not attack itself voluntarily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> features a number of cards like this. Lich, Final Fortune (and its many reprints under different names), Nefarious Lich, Phage the Untouchable, Immortal Coil, and the Pact cycle will all kill you under the proper conditions. The trick is to win before those conditions are met or have very strong counters. On a broader level, this is actually part of the color black's traditional color strategies. A large number of strong black cards demand costs in addition to mana in order to activate or (more in line with the trope specifically) repeatedly harms the player for having them out. This has waned over the years, mostly due to numerous ways to benefit from harming oneself or sacrificing creatures that have been introduced to the game.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> where, when fighting a giant monster, Torg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">ignores the creature's giant eyeball altogether</a>, instead focusing on the fact that, <a class="urllink" href="http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/20091208">"It lifts its belly every minute or two! Go for the soft, occasionally revealed, underbelly!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsCustomizableCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsCustomizableCardGame">Star Wars Customizable Card Game</a></em> features this for the second Death Star. A card called That Thing's Operational lets you move your Death Star and blast capital ships with it, but it also means that, when not around Endor or if the shield's not up, your Death Star is vulnerable. The light side player doesn't even have to play another card!
</li><li> Apollo Creed in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyII">Rocky</a></em> movie. By the final round, both he and Rocky are exhausted, and Apollo has won every round except one. All he had to do was fight defensively and he would have won by decision. Instead, he goes for a knockout victory, a strategy that ultimately costs him the match and his championship.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>'s signature spots is going up to the top rope then being hurled off. He did this <em>all the time</em>, despite the fact it doesn't lead to anything except getting thrown off by anyone he squares off with.
</li><li> In the fourth book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series, the heroes are fighting the demon Balor, who is invincible unless he opens his eye to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam">Eye Beam</a> attack. The problem is that he doesn't need to use that attack to win, so it looks like the world is doomed... until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">Spoony Bard</a> taunts Balor into using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam">Eye Beam</a>, at which point the hero throws the Spear of Fire into Balor's eye and kills him.
