</p><p>This is especially odd when said characters handle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> on a regular basis and are able to kill an army like it was nothing. Apparently, going to jail for tax evasion is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>. On the plus side, they help the reader relate to the character (because taxes <strong>are</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>) and can even make the villain more sympathetic, pitting them against the unfathomable might of... taxes. Even gangsters who get away daily with murder and robbery may fall into the clutches of the law, dead or alive, if they don't pay their income tax. (In fact, that actually happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>.)
</p><p>Sometimes, the intimidating part comes from a person who gets a summons to the tax office and the person fears that they are in trouble and might be arrested for a tax violation. In this kind of story, it turns out the bureaucrat is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">a nice enough person</a> who just wanted to clear up a minor problem and, seeing that the character is frightened, has to give some reassurances that nothing is wrong beyond that.

Based on His Majesty's Inland Revenue department, it was founded shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">the beginning of the USA's Civil War as part of the process of full economic mobilisation required to build up and sustain an army big enough to suppress the rebellion</a>.
</p><p>Most every country has its own version of this, often depicted the same way. They count as well.

<ul><li> There was the 1961 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> story "Superman Owes a Billion Dollars" where the IRS notices that Superman hasn't paid taxes ever, so, long story short, the Man of Steel has to raise a billion dollars fast, or else he will be arrested. Or something (it's hard to tell, he is <em>Superman</em>, for crying out loud). Before you ask, Superman's income comes from the rewards on the criminals he catches and the diamonds he makes when he crushes coal in his hands. He donates everything to charity though. The story ends with the taxman's superior saying that since Superman has dedicated his life to helping the population of Earth, he can literally claim <em>billions</em> of dependents and thus any tax obligations are then effectively canceled. Presumably he only claims the ones who don't pay US taxes (as otherwise no one could claim the standard deduction that requires one not be someone's dependent). In addition, his dependents deduction would be limited on a billion dollar adjusted gross income. This story was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript">Recycled Script</a> of an earlier 1957 Superman story, "Superman's Billion Dollar Debt." Yes, DC had the Man of Steel face the IRS twice.

</li><li> In an issue of <em>The Astonishing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a></em>, a group of veteran villains tell the new Magician that he's going to need a good accountant if he's gonna be a supervillain. Hijacker even says the only thing scarier than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> is the IRS.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> One issue has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> make a bargain with the tax man to waive their back taxes (mostly Wolverine's, who has never paid taxes in his life) in return for rounding up tax dodgers and making <em>them</em> pay their taxes.
</li><li> It should be noted that the deal was that by getting the tax dodgers, the Avengers could file theirs without giving up their secret identities to the government (Tony Stark offered to pay the sum.) At the end of the story, the team gets back at the tax man the only way one can...
<div class="indent"><strong>Agent Harvey</strong>: And with <em>that</em>, gentlemen, your job is finished. Thank you very much. It's been a <em>pleasure.</em> <br/><strong>Giant-Girl</strong>: <em>Hah.</em> You say that <em>now...</em> <br/><strong>Iron-Man</strong>: But wait until you get our list of <em>tax reductions</em> for this job. <br/><strong>Giant-Girl</strong>: I saved <em>receipts!</em> <br/><strong>Agent Harvey</strong>: <em>Urrkkk!</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> At one point, Wally West got a job with the IRS to pay off his massive debt. In the issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> where this begins, a furious mayor is about to demand compensation for the massive property damage involved in apprehending a supervillain tax evader, but backs off when he flashes his badge. In the next issue, Wally contemplates the possibility of nailing the Joker on this basis.
</li><li> The secondary plotline of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AchilleTalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AchilleTalon">Achille Talon</a></em> album deals with a tax man showing up at his door for an audit of the last five years. Cue Achille's <em>father</em> with boxes and boxes of receipts, opening discussions upfront with an "iron clad case that those ballpoint pens were a legitimate business expense" and tipping off the tax man that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">may be in over his head.</a> By the end of the album, Achille's father is sitting on a <em>mountain</em> of receipts, the tax man is crying his surrender and they've barely gone through <em>the first morning's expenses for the five year period being audited.</em>

</li><li> Near the end of "The Last Lord of El Dorado", Scrooge's glee at having Flintheart Glomgold owe him "All the money in the world" due to unpaid interest on El Dorado's gold into an obscure bank Glomgold bought from Scrooge is cut short when the government shows up to claim unpaid <em>taxes,</em> and, Scrooge has no choice but to give up the gold to avoid going broke "Two centuries before he was born."
</li><li> A classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik</a> story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts it</a> twice before playing it straight... And then subverting it again:
<ul><li> The first subversion comes when the city of Duckburg tries to enforce the payment of taxes... And fails miserably, with most collectors getting beat up and <em>a rich family tricking the collector into canceling them from the taxpayers list and give them some money</em>.
</li><li> The second comes when the mayor hires three experts. The experts are replaced by the Beagle Boys, who try this... Except the collectors are still the guys who got defeated the first time.
</li><li> Played straight when the Beagle Boys replace the collectors with small-time criminals, who aren't so easily tricked or beat up and succeed in collecting the Beagle Boys' insane taxes.
</li><li> And finally subverted again when the citizens get fed up, <em>beat up the collectors and <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">form a lynching mob</a></strong> to get back their money</em>. The collectors wisely run away.
</li></ul></li><li> A <em>Fantomius</em> story reveals that the costume of the Phantom of Notre Duck was copied from one of his ancestors, a terrifying tax collector. The costume is still creepy in modern times.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog">Strontium Dog</a></em>: Johnny Alpha and Wulf Stenhammer are hounded by tax agent Orville Paxman in one story. The pudgy little pencil-pusher turns out to be dedicated enough to follow Alpha and Stenhammer on a job, which is saying something.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AsterixInSwitzerland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AsterixInSwitzerland">Asterix in Switzerland</a></em>, the plot is kicked off when governor Varius Flavus is faced with an audit by the Roman Quaestor (inspector) Vexatius Sinusitus, and poisons him in an attempt to avoid the audit. Atypically for this trope, Sinusitus is actually portrayed as just an honest official trying to do his job, while Flavus is corrupt, and genuinely was doing things that were grounds for an audit (embezzling from his district's tax revenues).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em>, Jack Hawksmoor makes a crack about "so this is what we pay taxes for", only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> to remind him that he's never paid taxes. Somewhat justifiably, too - he's never actually held down a <em>job</em> due to his repeated abductions since childhood, and as an adult he never needed to due to his symbiosis with cities.
</li><li> In one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon">Mortadelo y Filemón</a></em>'s issues, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">Freddy Krueger</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>) assaults a man, who gives him a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSmile">Smug Smile</a> while showing him he is a tax inspector. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> promptly runs away, horrified.
</li><li> The IRS is a central <em>threat</em> in the second story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LargoWinch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LargoWinch">Largo Winch</a></em>; the titular character has just ducked and swerved through an international criminal conspiracy - which has killed over a dozen people as collateral damage - in order to claim his $10 <em>billion</em> inheritance. He barely has a chance to catch his breath and patch his wounds when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings">taxman shows up to claim ten percent of it</a>.

They tend to get really pissed when you generate fake invoices, embezzle property from your own company, sell it for cash, and then write-off the lost property.

<ul><li> American income taxes are typically considered, <em>especially</em> by honest and law-abiding citizens, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">maddeningly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">obstructively</a> difficult process to write out and calculate. People without the money to hire an accountant tend to never quite feel they've gotten it right, always worrying about whether they took too large a deduction or could have gotten a slightly larger refund.
<ul><li> This has gotten a bit better in the Information Age, with computer based systems making it relatively easy to file your taxes, walking you through the process and ensuring all portions are completed accurately. In fact, today it is advised to electronically file your return, as it will get processed faster (with direct deposit and e-filing, turnaround can be as little as a week), and prevents transcription errors (as today, all that happens with a paper form is that a clerk transcribes it into the e-filing system.)
</li><li> The complexity of tax returns tends to be exaggerated in fiction, where someone who works as an employee has to file a return hundreds of pages thick, while in real life even if they filed the long form it would be two sheets of paper (plus their W-2), with the numbers copied off the W-2 and mortgage interest statement. And they always make a mad rush for the post office on April 15th, rather than filing for an extension or e-filing. This is partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">bureaucracy</a> in general and tax collectors in particular have always been high on the list of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>. Another factor is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreWriters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreWriters">Most Writers Are Writers</a> — writers who work as independent contractors really <em>do</em> have complicated tax returns because they need to document all their business expenses.
</li><li> Another factor is that the IRS (along with the Secret Service, which was originally created to deal with counterfeiting crimes and still does to this day) are some of the most successful law enforcement agencies in the United States (most Federal level law enforcement agencies are ridiculously successful). In fact, the reason the Secret Service has its most famous job of Presidential Protection is because they were ridiculously good compared to other federal agencies when they were looking for the agency for the task. The US government puts a lot of investment into making sure it isn't getting cheated out of its money... except by people wealthy enough to be writing the laws.
</li></ul></li><li> Infamously, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a> was brought to justice it was on charges of of tax evasion. However, that was because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JusticeByOtherLegalMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JusticeByOtherLegalMeans">nothing else would stick</a></em>, since he had such good lawyers/intimidation that none of the more serious charges would stand up to court scrutiny. Ironically, Capone frequently mocked the IRS, saying that because you didn't file earnings that you made illegally, they couldn't touch him (he went to prison, got out after serving his time, and died of syphilis seven years later).
<ul><li> This is becoming more and more SOP for police investigations of notorious and/or leading criminals with a lot of conspicuous consumption-the police invite the IRS to look over the suspect's holdings to see if they owe any back taxes. The IRS is only too happy to insist that criminals pay taxes on their ill-gotten gains (as Capone learned the hard way)-the only thing they can't require is disclosure of the income source (as that would run afoul of the Fifth Amendment prohibition on self-incrimination.) Invariably, many criminals <em>haven't</em> paid their taxes, and the IRS will gladly seize any and all of their assets for payment of the back taxes and the associated penalties.
</li><li> In the United States, the courts have ruled that the purpose of the tax laws are to collect taxes on income, *not* to punish other unlawful behavior. They have also ruled that reporting illegal income is not "self-incrimination", since you aren't being asked to confess to any specific crime. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">If you rob a bank you are expected to pay taxes on the loot you get away with. It is even permissible to claim the cost of the weapons and masks you wore as deductions on income!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes">Wesley Snipes</a> was imprisoned for attempting to evade taxes using frivolous arguments, and, allegedly, attempting to pay his taxes by printing his own money. The IRS and the Tax Courts have heard all the various 'tax protester' arguments over and over, to the point that even using them will not only guarantee you losing the case, but net you a nice shiny contempt of court charge for even trying to argue those particular points.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> was infamous for using the IRS as a weapon against his political enemies, which is one specific reason the IRS is no longer entirely beholden to the federal government (they represent it, but do not necessarily answer directly to it). Other presidents have been accused of doing the same thing. True or not, it's a very serious allegation, and one does best not to trifle with the system. Others, as recently as 2009, <a class="urllink" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124260113149028331.html">have drawn sharp criticism for joking about auditing their opposition, which is really not a very funny joke at all<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, especially to those who <em>are</em> the opposition.
</li><li> Mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> by countries that use pay-as-you-go tax (taxes are withheld from your pay, at which point you claim back your deductions.) Just don't make too many furphies on your tax return...
<ul><li> And remember that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">the home country of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210152,00.html">pay as<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=110413,00.html">you go<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> system too.
</li><li> Although even here, the government wins (at least from a macroeconomic point of view)-tax refunds don't get interest put on them, and to the government anything you pay over is an interest-free loan.
</li></ul></li><li> If you think the IRS is intimidating you should read up on the United States Revenue Cutter Service. A part of the US Treasury department created not long after the Revolutionary War, it was initially responsible with combating smuggling, piracy and doing stuff the Coast Guard does today (in fact this service was the ancestor of today's US coast guard), but its ships wound up fighting with distinction in actual stand up wars against other nations and between 1790 and 1798 it was the only service America had capable of fighting on the ocean.
<ul><li> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is a tough law enforcement agency that uses its own trained and armed response units. It was also part of the Treasury Department until 2002. The bureau was originally formed to enforce taxes on alcohol, tobacco and firearms, and it was obvious from the beginning that such enforcement was especially dangerous.
</li></ul></li><li> In Brazil, the tax service chose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">lion</a> as the mascot for the income tax, as it represents strength, justice and an animal that's "tame but not foolish." The nickname stuck, but probably due to the lion being a predator as ferocious as the tax itself.
</li><li> Many, many, <em><strong>many</strong></em> boxers have been screwed over by the IRS. This is partly because they came from poverty and don't know how taxes work and mainly because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyToThrowAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyToThrowAway">terrible with money</a>. A good example of the former is Joe Louis giving his fight purse to the army as charity and not filing the correct paper work, ultimately getting screwed over hard in the process. Sugar Ray Robinson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone">Mike Tyson</a> are definitely the latter.
<ul><li> It isn't just boxers-many professional athletes in general can owe millions in back taxes as one of many financial problems (often leading to bankruptcy) despite making millions of dollars annually. The reasons behind them are as various as the problems and eventual fates-see "Broke", an ESPN <em>30 for 30</em> documentary on the subject.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS_targeting_controversy">ongoing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> scandal about how the Cincinnati office of the IRS handled applications from various Tea Party groups for 501(c)4 status brought to light a greater problem. As a reading of the relevant law makes clear, the real scandal here is that, in 1959, the IRS decided, without Congressional approval, that a law defining 501(c)4 groups as operating <em>exclusively</em> for the public welfare (and not for any political purposes) meant that groups operating <em>primarily</em> for the public welfare could gain the designation... at its discretion, of course. In other words, this loose definition gives the IRS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveEnforcement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveEnforcement">the power to be lenient in granting 501(c)4 status to groups it favors, and quite strict in denying it to those it doesn't</a>. Of course, as it turned out, the Cincinnati office "scandal" turned out not to be-in reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">the whole thing was a farce of incompetence and overwork</a>, and both liberal and conservative groups were being denied (the perception that more conservative groups were being turned down was because more of them were applying)-but the problem remains.
<p></p></li><li> The Japanese Visual Kei scene has had multiple issues (due to artists, label owners, and others engaging in "creative accounting" that would make some American "tax protesters" quite jealous). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DynamiteTommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DynamiteTommy">Dynamite Tommy</a>, producer Tetsuya Komuro, Music/Kisaki, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gackt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gackt">Gackt</a>, among others, have <em>all</em> had issues with the Japanese equivalent of the IRS. (Komuro and Kisaki were both found guilty, with Komuro even serving a short prison sentence, while Dynamite Tommy was found not guilty and released post arrest, and Gackt's case is still under investigation...)
</li><li> Doberman pinschers were bred by a Prussian tax collector, Karl Doberman, to protect himself from muggers (since his job required him to go into sketchy areas of town carrying money).
</li><li> As a matter of fact, the (former, as of 2012) German collection agency for state TV, the GEZ (Gebühreneinzugszentrale) appealed to this trope, to the point of broadcasting a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">very provocative</a> TV spots ending with: "GEZ - Schon GEZahlt?" (GEZ - Paid up already?).
<ul><li> Also shamelessly mocked in its day, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZvJzPgIAQI">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting fact about British tax law has come to light in the wake of increasing public disapproval of the proliferation of unpaid internships. There are quite specific rules on what an intern can and cannot be made to do before they cease to be an intern and turn into an employee, but unfortunately enforcement is somewhat spotty and the UK treats theft of services as a civil matter rather than a felony. However, it has been pointed out that if a company is not paying someone wages when they should be, it's an odds-on bet that they are <em>also</em> not paying their Employer's National Insurance contribution for that person. And the Inland Revenue will always welcome anonymous tip-offs...
</li><li> Italy brought this trope to the logical extreme. How? Financial crimes and tax evasion are in the jurisdiction of the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardia_di_Finanza">Guardia di Finanza<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a <em>military police force</em> that has actually fought with valour in both World Wars and, being both law enforcement, custom guards and military, is equipped as light infantry (up to general purpose machine guns and 40mm <em>grenade launchers</em>) and has <em>combat helicopters</em> (normally used as patrol) and small <em>warships</em> (to scare off smugglers as they patrol Italy's enormous coastline. They're up to 340 tonnes, and they all come with heavy machine guns and/or autocannons). May God help you if you run afoul of them.
<ul><li> Financial guards are or were part of several nations' law enforcement system <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Guard">per the other wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> , although the Italian one may be exceptionally well armed. United States had a such service, too, in the form of US Revenue Cutter Service, which operated warships that fought in wars as recent as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">Spanish-American War</a>. The captain of one of its ships even won a Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions off the coast of Cuba. However, in 1915, USRC was merged with other services to form the Coast Guard as its tax collection duties were considered no longer important.
<ul><li> Finance guards, especially those operating warships, were important in an era when nations' tax revenues came mostly from tariffs and excise taxes and tax cheats came in form of smugglers and moonshiners and other clandestine manufacturing operations. In an era of income tax, such agencies are less necessary. The demise of the US Revenue Cutter Service (as an armed tax collection agency) coincided with the shift of the main resource of revenue to the income tax (i.e. the "Internal Revenue") rather than tariffs and excise taxes on whiskey.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6aw2e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6aw2e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6aw2e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The temperance movement was actually one of the major groups supporting the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment, which made a federal income tax workable (it allowed the taxation of income "derived from property" without "apportionment"; what those terms mean is so hard to explain that you'll just have to trust us that a worthwhile income tax would've been impossible without the Sixteenth Amendment). Once there was a federal income tax, the federal government was no longer reliant on the whiskey tax to fund its operations, and a major barrier to Prohibition was ended.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope is sometimes exploited by scammers, who contact their marks via phone and email, telling them that they owe on their taxes and need to pay up <em>now</em>, or face dire consequences. They're banking that the victims will be afraid of being arrested or whatever and give them access to all kinds of sensitive information or might be immigrants from countries where people routinely pay bribes to government officials. The IRS never contacts people via phone or email; if they need to get in touch with you, they will either (snail) mail you something, or if it's <em>really</em> serious, someone will show up at your door.
</li><li> If you make enough money this could be a discredited trope, given how easy it is for the super-rich to sidestep tax or to "minimise their tax burden" by registering as citizens or companies in tax havens - usually microstates that would be Third World backwaters if not for their banking and financial centres. British governments have also been notorious for brokering "sweetheart deals" with big companies that make a significant amount of money in Britain - here the Inland Revenue actually <em>helps</em> companies like Boots, Amazon, Mail Group Newspapers, et c, pay little or no tax in Britain. It seemingly falls over backwards to do so, in fact. The upshot of this is that for every big earner not paying their fair share, everybody else's tax burden goes up, even by a tiny fraction.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the Roman Empire, where the authorities expected the tax collectors to supplement their official wages by cheating people and extorting more money from them than the law required. In conquered provinces, they were often natives to the area who were working with their conquerors, which meant they were also viewed as traitors. See the entry for the Bible under literature to see how popular this made them.
