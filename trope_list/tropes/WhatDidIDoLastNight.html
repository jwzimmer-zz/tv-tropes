</p><p>Might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> where not even the characters know or remember what happened. Often, but not always, involves drugs or alcohol. Strictly speaking, it doesn't have to be a night. It can be any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">alcohol- or drug-induced craziness</a> plus memory block.
</p><p>The character wakes up confused in a compromising position, and then utters in confusion: "What did I do last night?" As they learn more about what happened they repeat themselves, only this time in horror: "What did I DO last night?!" Often the episode becomes a quest to learn the truth. Usually, in comedy, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a> situation, but in drama it often is what it looks like, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> and an Aesop about not drinking. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction">Mystery Fiction</a>, it's occasionally used to set up a Whodunnit where the protagonist himself has no alibi and may not be certain they did not, in fact, commit the crime.

</p><p>This is a common romance comedy trope, sometimes used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>. For example, have two people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedmateReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedmateReveal">end up in bed</a> whom the fandom has been pairing up (despite their hating each other in canon).

</p><p>Another version can occur where everybody else <em>does</em> know what happened last night, but decide to conceal it so as to have some fun with the poor guy who can't remember.

</li><li> The "Get High, Get Stupid, Get AIDS" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">Public Service Announcement</a> involves a woman discovering a strange man in her shower after waking up in her bed and the man panicking over why he's showering in a strange woman's bathroom. The two come to the startling realization that they may have AIDS due to having sex while intoxicated the previous night, but they both sigh in relief upon remembering that they are just cartoon characters and not real people.
</li><li> On a similar vein, a "Get High, Get Stupid Â… " PSA warns against drug abuse. One memorable one had a young man, who had gotten high (or drunk) the night before, awaken by a call informing him he was responsible for some heinous action. Said act is never stated outright, but it is implied it involves a woman and that she is not OK. "So we're OK, dude?" the guy cluelessly asks before the caller hangs up.

</li><li> The OVA for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a>: The Second Raid</em> is essentially about this happening to Tessa (thanks to Melissa Mao), and her struggles to figure out (without tipping off people who don't know about it) how she ended up waking up half-naked in her commander's chair.

His roommates are a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a> so when he asks what happened they tell him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">two different versions</a>: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> hates him because was teasing her and didn't put out, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> hates him because he stripped and danced nude for her. The third roommate tries to give him a third version (also suitably horrific), but at this point, he is so horrified that he runs away screaming.

Mitaka is worried that something happened between them, so he finds her and asks her if he did "something indecent".

It doesn't help when she adds: "I won't forget, because I'm a woman." Then she comes to tell him that her dog is pregnant and his dog is the father. Well... guess what he (and everybody else who overhears) thinks she is referring to? Before you know it he's married- and then discovers the truth.</span> This allowed the use of both the comedic version and the dramatic version at the same time while providing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">aesop</a> on not drinking, which is nonetheless perfectly acceptable because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.

</li><li> Carla remembers having sex with one of the guys but doesn't remember which one. She later finds out it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paul</span>.
</li><li> Cliff and Norm try to reconstruct the events of the previous night by emptying their pockets and looking over the receipts. Most notable among them was one from a tattoo parlor.

</li><li> The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> gave up drinking and drugs was that he had this happen to him regularly - the last time it happened, he woke up in prison, and when he jokingly asked what he'd done, he was stunned to hear that he'd tried to murder his wife Sharon, almost strangling her to death. A happy ending, actually, since it made him get off the drugs and it helped him change his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">(already abusive)</a> relationship with Sharon into a healthy marriage.

</li><li> A popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> meme in 2011 was to post something on your status to the effect of "You and I wake up (in prison/in the back of a car/covered in shaving cream/or any odd circumstances). What are the first three words out of your mouth?" And then see what other people would say.
</li><li> A lot darker, but in most situations, this is considered rape because you need to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafeSaneAndConsensual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafeSaneAndConsensual">Safe, Sane, and Consensual</a>. Being too drunk to even remember what happened is considered a very, very bad thing.
</li><li> Sleepwalking, there have been documented cases where people have got into their car and started driving (and making it to their destination safely), made whole meals, shopped for groceries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">committed armed robbery, rape, and murder</a>, all while fast asleep.

He admitted in his biography that he can't remember a single point of its creation. He also claims that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaximumOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaximumOverdrive">Maximum Overdrive</a></em> was directed mainly by his cocaine habit.
