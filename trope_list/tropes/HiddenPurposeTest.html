<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> loves doing this.
<ul><li> Hatake Kakashi sets up a test where three fresh ninja recruits have to steal bells from him... which is totally impossible. The day before, he told them to skip breakfast without explaining the exercise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">under the premise that it'd make them throw up otherwise</a>, so they'd be hungry during the test, and then busts one of them trying to sneak food. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game is actually to see whether they will break the rules and feed their starving team mate, since ninja who fail missions are trash, but ninja who don't look out for each other are "lower than that!"</span>
</li><li> The first stage of the Chuunin Exam is just finding the room for it by seeing through an illusion technique. The final question is given at the end with the condition that once you've heard the question, if you get it wrong you instantly fail and can never take the exam again. However, you can quit and try again next year, but this also makes your teammates fail. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There is no question, it's just a test to see if you'll risk yourself for your teammates' benefit.</span>
</li><li> During a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode, its revealed that the dreaded "final question" in the chuunin exam one year was subtly different. In this version, if you get the question wrong, you're still fine but your teammates are stuck as genin forever. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agreeing to continue means you fail, as once again, the purpose of the question is to determine who will sacrifice their teammates for their own benefit.</span>
</li><li> The first nine questions are themselves a hidden purpose test of <em>skill</em>: The questions are too difficult for most genin to know, but there are two fake candidates taking the test. There are proctors watching the candidates, and any genin caught cheating five times is automatically failed, along with their team. The key to passing the test is to figure out how to get the answers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught">without getting caught,</a> as a test of the ninja's information-gathering skills. The proctors merely pretend not to notice some of the cheating (Ibiki notices that Gaara is up to something, but gives him a pass as he can't figure out what), but presumably give penalties for what they consider to be substandard information gathering. <br/><br/>Both Naruto and Sakura managed to pass via accidental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. Neither of them got caught cheating because they simply didn't cheat in the first place - Sakura was smart enough to answer the questions legitimately, and Naruto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">left his page blank. Due to the way the Chuunin Exam rules worked (you automatically pass if you make it to the tenth question and answer that correctly), he passes despite not having done anything.</span>

<ul><li> Genkai makes the interested applicants for her Spirit Training play video games. One is a karaoke machine, another a punching bag, and another a "rock-paper-scissors" type of game. The bag tests Spirit Energy, the karaoke machine tests how well they can sync up with the supernatural and the rock-paper-scissors game tests spiritual awareness.
</li><li> Prior to this, Genkai weeds out potential students from rejects by way of a lottery. Each candidate receives an envelope with a piece of paper. Those with blank paper strips are sent home, while those with red strips advance. In truth, <em>all</em> of the strips start out blank. They only turn red if the candidate has a certain minimum amount of spirit energy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHoneyNoSutekiNaBouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHoneyNoSutekiNaBouken">Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken</a></em>, Honey <em>thinks</em> she has to run over hot coals as a ritual for a nomadic tribe's people, but in truth she has to remove her shoes because they are looking for a rose-shaped birthmark that represents royalty on a young girl's foot.
</li><li> The last chapters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrangeAndBrightNatureDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrangeAndBrightNatureDeity">Strange and Bright Nature Deity</a></em>, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Yukari</a> testing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit">the three fairy protagonists</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">danmaku</a> to see if they were fit to live in the very special tree they were planning to move in. After the three fairies were shot to hell and back and were ready to give up on the tree, Yukari revealed that she wasn't testing how strong they were, she was testing how <em>weak</em> they were. Yukari didn't want anything powerful and potentially troublesome inhabiting the tree because it was important to the border around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">Gensokyo</a>. Since the three fairies proved themselves to be utterly pathetic in terms of power, they passed with flying colors.
</li><li> In <em>Million Dollar Kid</em>, a tycoon gives one hundred million yen to each of his three sons and tells them the one who best uses the money will succeed him. What the youngest son (a gambling addict who happens to be the protagonist) doesn't know is that his father is using this as an excuse to cast him off from the family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Hiruma</a> staging a test to eliminate the many people who want to join the team.

However, Hiruma set it so it was very difficult (but not impossible) to reach the top. Such as adding sugar to the ice to make it melt faster, certain floors have the temperatures raised to alarming levels and being chased by Hiruma's vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryGuardDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryGuardDog">Angry Guard Dog</a>. When asked about the unfairness of the test, Hiruma stated that he was looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">those with determination</a> who could make it to the top, regardless of how difficult or challenging the test was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So Hiruma and co. waited until sundown for <em>anyone</em> who was strong-willed enough to fulfill the task no matter what.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> has the Stagiaire, a month-long period where the first-years of Tootsuki are sent off to various professional kitchens to work for them for a week. However, the objective isn't simply to get experience working in a real restaurant. The true objective is to leave "visible results", in other words, to prove that they can do more than what was just simply assigned and leave a lasting impact on their assigned restaurant (such as making a new dish or permanently solving problem the kitchen had been facing). Beyond even that, the student is also expected to surpass their own limitations and learn something new during this period.
</li><li> Heavily implied to be the case for Polpo's test in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo</a></em>. The initiation to join Passione is that you are to keep a lighter lit for twenty-four hours. However, it's easier said than done. If the lighter goes out, that's when the <em>true</em> test begins as his Stand appears and pierces you with an arrow that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">either manifests a Stand of your own when hit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">or die from the strain.</a>

However, when he gets the results he learns that the test had a hidden part where candidates could earn Rescue Points for heroic actions such as saving others - and he has earned enough points that he passes.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Fan Fiction </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://aadler.iwarp.com/2_synhnf.htm">Hell Hath No Fury<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the hero agrees to face three tests, of body, mind and spirit. Only after going through all three does he discover what he thought was a test of body was actually a test of mind, the test of spirit actually a test of body, and the test of mind actually a test of spirit.
</li><li> To be admitted to the eponymous <em>Princess Sparkle's School for Eccentric Unicorns</em>, Twilight challenges applicants to do what only she has in a thousand years: create new magic. Only four unicorns pass the test, by simply trying any spell, instead of just giving up or raging. Technically the test was "show her a spell she has never seen before", it's just that she's seen so many spells, even ones she didn't know how to cast, that the only way to guarantee winning was to invent a new spell. Lyra passed because the musical spell she cast was to relax her nerves and she kept casting afterwards in a panic. Trixie cast her spell just to spite Twilight for giving her an impossible test. Fleur didn't want to disappoint her husband and so cast the most obscure spell she had in desperation that Twilight hadn't seen it before. Vinyl wasn't taking the whole test seriously at all and just cast something for fun.
</li><li> There was an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> fanfic where Ione (an Avatar like Trance) and Harper argue over who should marry Trance. It is stated that the matter should be decided in a battle. Naturally, Ione beats Harper badly...after which it is announced that <em>Harper</em> is the winner, since he was more honorable (Ione refused to fight as an equal) and more determined (by refusing to surrender). There could never be any doubt about who's stronger.
</li><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/3883024?view_full_work=true">A Gem and Her Pearl,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> the insurgent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Rose Quartz</a> chooses a slave this way.

<ul><li> Potential recruits are shown taking a marksmanship test, with a mix of both alien and human targets in a street scene. James Edwards ignores the aliens, putting a single shot in the forehead of a little girl, and invokes this trope when ordered to explain his choice, claiming she was the most suspicious target since she was carrying quantum physics textbooks and looked too young to be out by herself at night surrounded by said aliens. The movie leaves it up in the air as to whether Edwards is right or whether it's his other qualities - quick outside-the-box thinking, attention to detail, and willingness to challenge authority, among others - that lead Agent K to select Edwards as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his replacement.</span> The novelization (which deviates from the film in some areas) presents his reasoning as correct.
</li><li> When presented with a multiple-choice test on paper with no flat surface to write on, Edwards very noisily drags a table over to his chair while everyone else stays where they are and struggles with the difficulty of pencilling in their answers on the floppy paper test sheets in their egg-shape chairs.

Eventually he does, immediately after which it is revealed to be a test. He is made to leave the training facility on the pretext that he failed the test, but is later told that the other recruits were made to believe that because he's been selected for covert assignments. The test was in fact to see how long he could hold out and wasn't going to stop until he gave in. He actually lasted longer than any recruit in a long time.

One of them requires him to stand over a milk bottle and drop beans into the bottle with his eyes closed. Matt ends up with only one bean in his bottle and sadly turns it in. He notices while standing in line that several people got many beans in their bottles, and after turning his in, he asks the examiner what would keep people from cheating by peeking. The examiner says, "Nothing at all", much to Matt's disappointment. Then the book says about Matt: "It did not occur to him that he might not know what was being tested."

When it was over, Cao gathered all the officials in the city. Those who left their homes to put out the fires were told to stand under a red flag; those who stayed in their homes were told to stand under a white flag.

She obediently carries out her "punishments" but can't figure out what lesson she's supposed to be learning. When she finally stands up to the Wise Ones and refuses to accept her punishment, they accept her as one of their own. Aviendha learns at the same time the real problem with this kind of test (which the Wise Ones are well aware of): by acknowledging those and only those who claim they deserve to be acknowledged, the women who least deserve to be treated as Wise Ones are often the quickest to gain the title. And unsurprisingly (for this series and an all-female group), they don't want any rumor that Wise Ones ever disagree about anything - which means at least publicly supporting the actions of the more foolish or shortsighted "Wise Ones" to preserve their mystique.

To find a worthy successor, the aging Emperor of Ancient China distributes seeds to his realm's children, promising that the boy that can grow the most beautiful flower will become the next Emperor.

To his surprise, Ping is selected to be the next Emperor. It turns out that the seeds that the Emperor handed out were cooked, and thus incapable of growing into flowers at all. The Emperor was actually testing the children's honesty, not their skill at growing flowers.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a> novel <em>Ogre, Ogre</em>, Smash goes through several of these with the Night Horse (ruler of the Night Mares).

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelverse">Star Trek</a> novel <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> has an example that does <em>not</em> involve the famous no-win scenario. One section is the story of Chekhov when he was a cadet and his class were taken to a training area, assigned stunners, and told that one of the cadets had been secretly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaGambit">designated as a hostile traitor</a> who would, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">given the opportunity, attack the others.</a> All the cadets immediately start hunting one another down, with Chekhov being the last survivor. The officer reveals that the cadets had all failed, and told Chekhov what his hero, Jim Kirk, had done. Kirk had organized the cadets into a single group with everyone present, all the weapons were confiscated and placed under guard, and the only cadets armed and allowed to be out of sight were the ones paired on guard duty at any given time. Kirk's reasoning was that if someone not assigned to guard duty tried to grab a weapon or sneak away from the group, they'd out themselves as the traitor. Since the guards were in pairs, if only one of a pair returned from duty, that person would also out prove they're the traitor. After telling Chekhov how Kirk did it, the officer then revealed that, of course, that no cadet had secretly been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> at all.
</li><li> The aptitude test in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">Divergent</a></em>.

</li><li> So common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em> that basically any training exercise that's actually shown in detail is almost definitely not training the skill the trainees think it is. Of course, there are classical military versions, like the sim in <em>Wraith Squadron</em> that's actually a drill on responding to changing battle conditions, i.e., the chain of command being destroyed. Wedge is also fond of running pilots who fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">smug ace</a> type through a test that's either strictly impossible without help from their wingmate, or gives an advantage to subsequent fliers (with the jock going first) to demonstrate that the squadron's success during the mission is more important than the individual's accolades. This comes to its natural conclusion in <em>Starfighters of Adumar</em> when he uses simulated duelling to teach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Adumari</a> pilots about the New Republic combat ethic.
</li><li> One riddle goes as follows: Two men both claim they're a long-lost prince and they're asked to take a test to prove it. The one who <em>refuses</em> to take it is declared to be the prince. Why? Because the test they were asked to take was a blood test and, unbeknownst to the impostor, the prince is hemophiliac.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> book <em>The Jedi Path,</em> mention is made of the Jedi Trials, a battery of five tests which a Jedi must pass to become a Knight. Three candidates are given an illusion of a great army marching towards them. One perceives the illusory nature of the army, and passes her Trial of Insight. One fights against overwhelming odds and simultaneously passes the Trials of Courage and Skill. One bows out, citing exhaustion, and fails to become a Knight.

Centuries ago, he forged a powerful artifact known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBandsOfMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBandsOfMourning">The Bands of Mourning</a></em> and stored it in a hidden temple for safekeeping, telling his people that they are not to seek them. Given that the temple's builders returned to share the story, many are sure that the Bands are a test of some sort, although nobody knows what the test is for. The Hunters think it's a test of loyalty and temptation, and try to destroy the Bands. Others, like Allik's crew, think it's a straightforward test of skill and courage.

In one exercise, an instructor shows cadets a table full of various firearms, and tells them they can take one item to help them escape through a door at the other end of a maze. Each cadet picks a gun and blasts away at targets that pop up in doorways and windows. Annie uses the butt of a gun to break glass and remove a map of the maze. After studying it for a minute, she sneaks through the maze, ducking out of sight of the targets as they pop up. Because it's this trope, and that sort of show, only Annie passes the test. Firing a gun even once betrays the presence of an agent, who's supposed to slip in and out unnoticed.

<ul><li> In one episode, various staff members were asked to take part in a observation test, identifying what item of Adam or Jamie's clothes changed each time they disappeared and reappeared behind a curtain. It actually <em>was</em> an observation test, but the point was to see if anyone noticed that the figure wasn't actually Adam or Jamie, but one of them posing as the other by wearing their clothes and a realistic latex mask of the other's head.
</li><li> A similar test was performed earlier in the episode on members of the general public (requirements: they'd watched the show, but didn't know Adam or Jamie personally). Their test was to shine a laser at a target, with Adam or Jamie standing off to the side of that target taking notes. Of course, it was actually Jamie or Adam disguised as the other, and the purpose of the test was to see if the test subjects would see through the disguise.
</li><li> A later episode involved test subjects being given directions to a site where the test would purportedly take place.

This leads Gunny Bardue, the adminstrator of the Combat Final, to change the parameters of the test: instead of facing each other, they would instead be attacked by simulated opponents <em>with the safeties off</em> (he does turn them back on partway through, but doesn't tell them that).

Rainbow helps her anyway, because the <em>true</em> test was if Twilight would try to the very end, even if it seemedand in this case, <em>was</em>hopeless, a trait that had already been tested in Equestria, and would stand her in good stead through the rest of the adventure.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em> episode "The Princess Test" adapts an Urban Legend about a test performed by a (typically Christian or otherwise values-based) university, wherein students are told to arrive at a certain location to take a test. In this case, the eponymous Princess Test. On the way there, the students pass the librarian, who requests that they help her carry her books home. Each of the princesses politely apologizes, since they have to make it to the test. Sofia is the only one who agrees to help. On the way, the librarian repeatedly takes up more of her time and "accidentally" ruins each of the things she's certain will help her pass the test (having a spotless gown, twirling her fan correctly, etc.), while also offering to let her leave to take the test. Sofia remains helping the librarian, only to find herself transported to the test upon reaching her cabin. The <em>real</em> test was to see whether the girls possessed the princessly trait of compassion, being willing to sacrifice their own goals for the sake of someone else. That said (because this is a Disney Junior show), all the other girls who took the traditional test pass as well, Sofia just gets highest marks and a trophy.
<ul><li> Also invoked accidentally in the episode "The Emerald Key," wherein Sofia's family sets up a test to see which of the identical "Princess Lalani"s is the real one, thereby receiving the eponymous key Sofia happened to find earlier. The tests (set up by Amber) are set up to test traditional princess attributes, like dancing the waltz, graciously accepting a gift from a "visiting diplomat," and... quickly making it through a maze. King Roland, the ultimate authority in the contest, doesn't intend any hidden meaning in the tests. He'd accept winning two out of three challenges outright as confirmation. Sofia, on the other hand, realizes that one competitor (nicknamed Lani) has been consistently behaving with the dignity and compassion befitting a princess, even when she wasn't being directly tested, thereby pegging her as the real princess. However, Sofia's unable to convince her family of this, so when Lani loses the final challenge, Roland gives the key to the other one. It isn't until the reveal that the impostor cheated to win the final challenge that the rest of the royal family realizes this was behavior unbecoming a real princess and move to correct their mistake.

A subject was told to push a button, and it would zap someone else in an unseen other room with an increasingly large dose of electricity. While it was all an act and the subject wasn't zapping anybody, the person supposedly being zapped in the other room would eventually start crying out in agony and beg the person to stop, while the testers told the subject that they had to continue with increasingly more authoritative prods. The whole thing was a test designed to see how people would follow orders from authority, and how far they'd go with it. While all forty of the test subjects stopped at least once, only fourteen of them refused to go as far as a lethal shock.
</li><li> Officials wanting to become civil servants in the Imperial Chinese Bureaucracy often had to pass extremely difficult and esoteric exams requiring precise forms of answer on irrelevant subjects. They weren't looking for your knowledge of the useless subjects—they were looking for your ability to master and apply a technical skill. This was so they could slot you in wherever you were needed—for China's famed bureaucracy was not very large at all (contrary to stereotype.)
</li><li> The British came across this technique in their Civil service exams. They couldn't actually care less whether you could translate, sight unseen, large slabs of Latin or Greek—what they did care about was your ability to master a technically difficult body of knowledge from scratch and apply it with precision and skill. To explain how well this worked- approximately one thousand Indian Civil Service clerks governed 250 million people in the Raj, and by all accounts did quite creditably well.
</li><li> Apocryphal stories will claim that leadership training in some military forces often involves this; these stories are old soldiers' jokes and metaphors about how to get things done in the army, and good luck finding documentation or evidence of their actual use:
<ul><li> A common test for officers in the military may involve a menial task such as digging a trench. The test is to see if the officer understands to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelegationRelay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelegationRelay">delegate the task</a> to an enlisted man rather than do it themselves.
</li><li> A variation is give a prospective junior officer a description of a situation, such as "You are to erect a 30-foot-long flagpole in a certain location to that the top is 24 feet above ground level. Your resources are a sergeant and 20 men, and four each picks, shovels, and axes, plus two thirty-foot ropes. What is the first order you give?" The correct answer is: "Sergeant, erect the flag-pole." The test is to see if he understands that the non-coms are supposed to see that the men do the assigned tasks, and figure out <em>how</em> to carry out orders, while the officer commanding the unit decides <em>what</em> should be done. Further, if the sergeant for some reason can't get the pole erected, and the officer must take over, he has time to think of something the sergeant hasn't tried. Also, he hasn't made himself look incompetent first, retaining respect as the leader.
</li><li> Another example (and much more believable) is a staff officer school test. The student is given a large amount of information on his side's forces and the notional enemy's, and told to plan to attack or defend against attack. He is given several days to prepare a set of orders for his side. When he shows up to present his answer, he's told the situation has changed, he's given new information, and he is given a few hours to prepare a second set of orders. When the time is up and he is about to present the revised plan, he's told the situation has changed again, given a third description of the situation, and told to give a new set of orders, <em>right now</em>. What appeared to be a test of how well the student could assimilate information at leisure and carefully plan for it is actually a test of how quickly he can adjust to new information and perform under unexpected circumstances, and also how much information he can retain from the first two stages to use in the third. (Of course, to keep the student honest, the written orders prepared in the first two stages can also be evaluated.)
</li><li> Another variant of the trench test: a bunch of candidates for non-com officer are brought out and told to do something useless, like dig a trench thirty feet long, six feet wide, and six inches deep. Most candidates complain. The ideal candidate does not simply start digging. The best NCO first confirms he has understood command correctly, verifying the order, then says, "Alright boys. Let's get this knocked out so we can get out of here!" The NCO has shown initiative to obey the order and the good sense to ensure it has been properly understood,
</li></ul></li><li> When a doctor or nurse is giving a basic physical examination, they'll pay a great deal of attention to the sphygmomanometer (the squeezy blood pressure cuff). While they are measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure, at the same time they're gauging the patient's breathing rate - because people tend to involuntarily alter their breathing when you tell them you're measuring it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">If you remember this at your next physical, you stand a good chance of screwing up the trick.</a> <br/><br/>This is informally called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_coat_hypertension">White Lab Coat Syndrome,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and a healthcare provider who isn't aware of it isn't worth their scrubs. That's why so many physicians and nurses ask odd questions that make patients wonder what in heck the practitioner is thinking. "Why is my cardiologist asking me if I have a ringing in my ears or having nose bleeds or headaches? Why is he looking in my eyes if I have heart problems?"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ah53');"><sup> Answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ah53" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ah53');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because any of those would be a clue that a patient's systemic hypertension, or high blood pressure, is real and not an artifact of the test.</span> Likewise, the physician will check on nail beds and squeeze fingers or just examine the patient's hands and feet on some pretext to see if there is a sign of poor oxygenation or circulation, or use a device which gives the pulse and oxygen content of the blood to check for it, or examine the mucosa of the mouth, etc. Really, your physician sees a lot more of what's happening than you might ever guess if (s)he's any good at all as a clinician.
</li><li> Deliberately averted in Experimental Economics; on the contrary to Experimental Psychology and for a number of reasons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0n9nj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0n9nj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0n9nj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mainly because in such experiments what is being tested is how people play games and economists want to avoid the players second guessing the purpose of the experiment, which could lead them to believe that the game they are playing is purposeless and playing 'sub-optimally'</span>, the commonly agreed methodology in Experimental Economy forbids from any sort of deception towards those participating in the test and any economist doing so would pretty much have no chance of being able to publish their results... in an economics journal, at least.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a> would sneak a clause into their contracts which let them keep all the money and cancel a show if there wasn't a bowl full of M&amp;Ms with all the brown ones taken out in their dressing rooms at a venue. This wasn't just pop-star preening - the clause was buried in a massive contract full of safety specifications for the band's setup, which could include flying harnesses, pyrotechnics, and numerous lights. The safety specs were exacting and far beyond what any other band was doing at the time. If a place didn't have the bowl full of M&amp;Ms in the dressing room — or if the bowl was there, but all the brown ones hadn't been removed — it was the proverbial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanaryInACoalMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanaryInACoalMine">Canary in a Coal Mine</a> that warned the band that something was up.

With shows as big and elaborate as Van Halen's, someone could easily be injured or killed if their directions weren't followed to the letter; the M&amp;Ms were thus the hidden test to see if a venue had done everything they were supposed to do. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp">Snopes has more details<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> That one test where you watch a clip showing a group of people passing basketballs between each other. The purported purpose is to count how many times the basketballs are thrown. The real purpose is to see whether you notice someone dressed in a gorilla suit walking between the players.
</li><li> There was one university lab experiment where the students were given some equipment and asked to calculate the value of gravity. One of the pieces of equipment was a metre ruler that was actually only 90cm long but falsely marked to appear as though it was a full metre long. Given that, there was no way of correctly calculating gravity and getting the expected result (approximately 9.8 m/s/s). Of course, since the students knew what value they should be getting there was much fudging of results and justification in their written report as to why their results seemed to be off.
</li><li> There is a version of this test, which the score being the time taken to perform a variety of tasks such as saying specific words aloud, or scratching your nose with your pencil's eraser. Again, the instructions are to read all the tasks before performing any of them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The last instruction directs the test subject to ignore everything written above. Turn the test over, and put your arms on the test, and put your head on your arms without saying or doing anything else.</span> Invariably, many subjects begin carrying out the instructions without reading them all first.
</li><li> An apocryphal story states that in the lead-up to D-Day, US Army brass needed to figure out who would be allocated to be among those who were paradropped/paraglided into France ahead of the main invasion. Soldiers who were selected and trained were instructed to enter a darkened barn where they couldn't see, then walk up to the second floor and reach up to find a metal pole. They would then shimmy along the pole until they were stopped by the voice, far enough that they could reasonably assume to be dangling high off the ground below. The voice would then tell the soldier to get down.
<ul><li> Allegedly: Little if any documentation of this test exists, and this is certainly unlike most methods of choosing military leaders or specialists. Stories like this about the military are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> (see Gideon, in Religion &amp; Mythology), but at odds with modern military practices.
</li><li> If the soldier did by just letting go of the pole, he would land softly in a large pile of hay that was underneath him. For following instructions quickly, he would be assigned to a unit.
</li><li> Some soldiers would turn around and go back the way they came. Many were prepared to admit that they failed the apparent test - instead, they were made sergeants and the commanding officer of a unit for not simply jumping in on orders and instead thinking over the whole situation.
</li><li> Others decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and continued to shimmy forward, where they would find a ladder that they could use to climb down. They were made engineers for their outside-the-box thinking.
