</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, Shizuo's property-destroying antics would have (and <em>has</em>) gotten him fired from any other job long ago, even with Tom vouching for him. Shizuo himself is aware of this and really has no clue how he's held on to this one job for as long as he has other than the possibility that his manager is just really, <em>really</em> nice. That and his antics make him scarier than Satan which is an asset <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector">in their job</a>.
<ul><li> His antics <em>do</em> have a detriment — all the property he destroys is paid for by the agency, and they dock his pay in return. Seeing as Shizuo really can't get a job anywhere else and that his little brother is an idol who is undoubtedly filthy rich, he doesn't really care. If anything, he's more surprised that he's paid at all.

Everything Gaoh does is strictly within the rules of football, as he's never seen hurting a quarterback after he's gotten rid of the ball. He's just insanely strong, such that he can cause bruises with his pinky.
</li><li> Forget the opposing teams, the main example is Hiruma. Of course, it's more his extensive blackmail files that keep him from being expelled or banned, but even those rarely get brought up later on because, hey, he <em>wins</em>.
</li><li> If it weren't for the fact that Shinryuuji's coach is more like something out of a martial arts movie, Agon probably would've been kicked off the team a long time ago.

In the first episode cyborg girl Henrietta flips out and kills an entire roomful of terrorists. Jean wants her reconditioned despite the objections of his brother, but Chief Lorenzo overrules him. Justified as Section 2 is a new unit that's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">proving its worth against rival departments</a> — it's better for Lorenzo to pass this off as a success than admit to glitches in the cyborg program.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lorenzo:</strong> "I agree Henrietta's got some problems, but she's an excellent assassin. Besides, we got the man we were looking for, and lost none of our own. You need to look at the bigger picture, Jean."

Despite this both are still in the military and the same unit. It's all but admitted that the higher-ups want to keep them for their ability to take down Objects and are worried that they'll defect to another supernation if punished too much.

How did he even get through the interview?

<ul><li> Vice-Admiral Garp is known as "The Hero" to the common man. He was going to report that he let Luffy escape on purpose, and implicitly would have gotten away with it. His subordinate convinces him that a simple lie would at least be less trouble. He can brag about his son, considered by the Marines to be one of the most dangerous men in the world, in public and be beyond punishment. Basically, nothing he does will ever result in discipline. It helps that his boss is also his best friend.
</li><li> The Seven Warlords of the Sea can get away with a <em>lot</em>. Only an extremely public scandal and/or defeat to a rookie, or a significant amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> can get anyone kicked out. As long as they're still perceived as strong enough to be useful to the World Government, and don't attempt outright rebellion against it, they're virtually guaranteed to keep their very cushy positions. For perspective, one was able to get away with planning a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> got him kicked out</span>.
<ul><li> And another of them was able to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">form an alliance with Luffy, who by this point has <em>twice</em> openly declared war against the World Government, which is considered the worst crime anyone can commit</span>. When this was discovered, one of the Admirals told him that he could <em>still</em> keep his position as Warlord, so long as he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">declared Luffy to be his minion rather than his partner</span>, nothing more than a token display of loyalty to the World Government.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Averted by the end of the Reverie Arc. The shit they pulled throughout the story led to the abolishment of the Warlord System, with their former 'allies' gladly baying for their blood immediately after.</span>

Despite almost never succeeding in anything, as well as spending large amounts of money on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, Giovanni still hasn't just fired them.
<ul><li> Since he no longer pays them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassigned them to Hoenn/Sinnoh</a>, it's likely that Giovanni simply doesn't consider them to be a part of the organization anymore. Letting them roam on their own is much simpler than filling out the paperwork necessary to fire them.
</li><li> Eventually averted. After Jessie, James, and Meowth wind up taking credit for the takedown of Team Galactic, Giovanni assigns them to be the Rocket Admins of Unova, at which point the massive confidence boost makes them incredibly effective at their job.
</li><li> They trio eventually get reverted back to comical incompetence, but proceed to continue a pattern of maintaining their employment by convincing Giovanni that they're the ones taking down criminal organizations in other regions that potentially pose a threat to Team Rocket.
</li></ul></li><li> Dojima in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em> comes in late, leaves early, takes extra-long breaks, and spends most of her time looking at fashion magazines, plus she was only hired because of who her father is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in that she's really there as a spy for the parent company, which is suspicious of the new procedures instituted by the Japan branch - she acts like a slacker who owes her job to nepotism, but this may just be her cover.</span>

The most they <em>ever</em> get is temporary suspension, nothing more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Mr. Iwamoto</a>, Yusuke's teacher. He encourages Mr. Akashi to erase an answer on Kuwabara's test so that he could get his friend fired from his job, steals from his students and frames Yusuke for it, and (though in his defense, under the influence of the Makai Insects) assaulted the principal while attacking Keiko. Despite those incidents, he still has his job by the end of the series.
</li><li> Mr. Kimura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">ephebophile</a> who openly admits he only became a teacher so he could look at high school girls, and he'll even skip his own class if it means he can look at the girls during swim lessons. Despite the girls and other teachers being aware of this, and even with him making some strong advances on Kaorin, nobody seems to actually do anything serious about it, mostly just telling him to buzz off.

Methods include: personal favors to the PHB, reporting his more ambitious colleagues to threatened superiors, having the PHB beaten on the occasion he *was* fired, tricking the PHB into signing favourable documents without reading them, and... just plain being lucky (the PHB admitted once that he's fired bald guys at least 7 times after mistaking them for Wally.)

I'm here in place of Wally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">who is working hard to build a better tomorrow</a>.
</div></li><li> Carol, the department secretary, is bitter and unproductive. The PHB <em>tried</em> to fire her once, but he couldn't fill out the termination paperwork without her. She also has a dark version of this trope and can't get out of her job even though she wants to. It was revealed once that she has an MBA, but her secretary job creates a stigma.
</li><li> For that matter, the PHB himself. He once hired Dogbert to read his boss's mind to learn what his boss thought of him. Dogbert later told him that his boss knows the PHB is an inefficient oaf, but doesn't want to go to the trouble of firing him, and then having to hire someone else.
</li><li> Also the case for many, <em>many</em> minor characters, be they sociopaths, convicted criminals, or simply morons who dedicated their lives to roaming from cubicle to cubicle talking about how hard they work and carrying a coffee cup. One, whose name may have been "Irv", never did <em>anything</em> but couldn't be fired because he'd written the company's accounting software in the mid-80's as a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> - a million lines of undocumented spaghetti logic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>: Thomson and Thompson are probably the worst detectives in the world (they were reasonably competent in <em>Cigars of the Pharaoh</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">but then...</a>), yet they keep being sent on important missions. The pinnacle of this trope at work is undoubtedly <em>Destination: Moon</em>/<em>Explorers on the Moon</em>, where they are assigned to protect the Syldavian space program (!!) and end up reporting for duty wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousPeriodDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousPeriodDress">traditional Greek outfits</a>, "arresting" a doctor's skeleton model, and accidentally stowing away on the Moon rocket (thus jeopardizing their oxygen supply) due to deciding to "guard" said rocket and believing the launch was at 1:34 <em>P.M</em> as opposed to 1:34 <em>A.M</em>.
</li><li> The title character of the comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GastonLagaffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GastonLagaffe">Gaston Lagaffe</a></em>, he's asleep more than awake on his job, his backlog of work is enough to fill the whole office, he accidentally set fire to things several times, keeps playing with toys during work hours, builds crazy inventions and lets them loose in the building, at least once blew up part of the building and on all occasions there where managed to mess up the signing of important contracts. Yet, no matter what chaos he causes and despite him only having a minor job as a office courier and errand boy, he never seems to get fired.
<ul><li> Well, he was once put in charge of the company archives, and turned it into a veritable sea of books and files, where only he could find anything without full spelunking gear...
</li><li> On a side note, he <em>was</em> fired once but was re hired shortly after, said incident was when the artist took a holiday which meant the next comic had some delay. That aside not even throwing a plunger in his bosses face got him fired.
</li><li> The in-story explanation is apparently that he somehow endeared himself to the in-story newspaper readers, enough for his de-hiring to provoke an outcry and a lot of mail demanding his return. This is probably linked to his <em>other</em> function in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic">real-life paper</a>, which was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.objectible.net/forum/showthread.php?39809-En-t%EAtes-de-Franquin/page2">appearing on the first page cosplaying as the hero of one of the comics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHood">The Hood</a></em>, the Controller's power play and constant attempts to undermine the Hood's authority are outweighed by his intelligence strategic acumen. Realizing he can't kill him, the Hood places one of the Controller's own slave discs on him to keep him in line.
</li><li> Ola Bog Rise, the goalie from the Norwegian football comic <em>Sleivdal</em>. Every player on that team are terrible - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">that's the premise of the comic</a> - but Ola is the only one that the coach is, for inexplicable reasons, actually pleased with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FrumpyTheClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FrumpyTheClown">Frumpy the Clown</a> was this with his teaching job, the running gag being that the Principal wanted to fire him but can't due to the powerful Teachers Union. However, he was finally fired in the end of the strip's run, when the budget cuts gave the Principal an excuse to get rid of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superlopez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superlopez">Superlópez</a></em>: López has been threatened with being fired several times, not to mention that he keeps disappearing from work without warning whenever some villain attacks his city and taking holidays left and right so he can fight evil abroad. And in the early comics, he spent the little time when he actually was staying at work just practicing origami.
<ul><li> Okay, he actually was fired once in <em>Los alienígenas</em>. That's pretty much it.
</li></ul></li><li> For years, Courtney in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail">Retail</a></em> was this. She was rude to customers, and did very poorly at her job, but she never seemed to get close to be fired, with Stuart flat out saying he kept her on over more competent cashiers because her wages were lower. This was finally averted when Marla, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp">who was promoted the store manager</a>, fired her. She hasn't been seen since 2013.
<ul><li> Also with Cooper, who manages the stock room. He frequently goofs off, pranks people, and openly insults Stuart, the district manager, on a frequent basis, but he's never fired due to him being good at his job. The one time Stuart did try to fire him, Lunker (a big, intimidating, incredibly strong man) <em>threatened him</em>, which probably helps keep his job. The only reason he did eventually lose his job is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grumbel's went out of business.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BigNate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BigNate">Big Nate</a></em>, the titular character created a character of his own named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery">Dr. Cesspool</a>. He is a buffoonish doctor who, despite botching most of his operations and an early strip stating that he's a serial killer off the clock, manages to keep his job.
<ul><li> In one of the <em>Big Nate</em> books, Nate and Dee Dee drew a comic where he's almost fired for removing the mayor's stomach (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid">which he though was causing the issue</a>), and only managed to keep his job because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">the mayor had an eating problem</a> and needed a solution.

Aside from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a> from Kairi's mother Rimi and discipline from Kaname and Ansem the Wise, the former the Captain of the Guard and Kairi's father, he was allowed to keep his job. In real life, doing something like dangling an infant over a staircase wouldn't have just gotten him fired; it would have gotten him arrested.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> features a variant. According to Loki, the only reason Fudge is still Minister of Magic by <em>Ghosts of the Past</em>, despite his epic string of blunders in the first book, is because literally no one else wants his job, because they neither want to have to clean up his mess nor deal with the encroaching power of MI13 (specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Director Wisdom</a>, for whom tormenting the Ministry is one of his few pleasures in life).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SlippingBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SlippingBetweenWorlds">Slipping Between Worlds</a></em> gave us Fusilier "Head-butt" Powell, whose skills on the rugby field are such that everyone from the Colonel down to Second Lieutenant Holtack pull every string to not have him ejected from the service. That <em>doesn't</em> stop them from dropping every conceivable <em>other</em> boot on Powell, and his not rising above Fusilier (E-1) in eleven years of service is clear testament to his skill at getting into trouble.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU">Kill la Kill AU</a></em>, we have Rei "the Drunk Secretary" Hououmaru. With her drunken antics, one would think either Soichiro or Ragyou would have fired her or, at least, gave her more restrictions, however, with her being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict">Addled Addict</a>, neither one felt it would be right to do so (as, apparently, she probably won't fare well otherwise).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChasingDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChasingDragons">Chasing Dragons</a></em>: At one point, Baelish notes that the Kindly Man (who is strongly implied to be Varys) has positioned himself just right in Myr's criminal underworld  he has enough power to be a valuable source of information and aid to both the royal government and other criminals, but not enough that either side views him as a threat that needs to be eliminated.

He disobeyed orders, messed around with the disarming procedures, left the base without any orders, went hunting insurgents through the alleys on the night without orders, backup or any clue about what he's doing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting Eldridge shot and severely wounded in process,</span> and generally act like an all-around douchebag.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace">Office Space</a></em> has a very odd version with Peter, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> about how oppressive the work environment is (including <em>five</em> managers for one employee) results in a series of rewards and promotions for him, while his comparably timid coworkers are on the chopping block for cutbacks. In the case of Milton, it's played with for either black comedy or plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">awfulness</a>: he <em>was</em> fired but a clerical error not only meant he was not told he was fired but he still got a check, so he kept coming to work.

True, his job as a sysadmin is only partly protected by being very good at what he does, and largely by means of threatening, blackmailing and (in extreme cases) <em>killing</em> anyone who might try to replace him.
<ul><li> It probably helps his job security that his assistant is the nephew of the CEO of the first company he works at in the Register-era stories, and indeed got them both jobs at the company.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fact that Hogwarts even remains in operation despite having a running body count has got to be an example in and of itself (though, being a school for magic, this is probably something of an occupational hazard), but a surprising number of the teachers also count. And that's not even getting into the fact that Hogwarts hasn't had a Defense Against the Dark Arts (which is arguably the most important class taught at any school) teacher last longer than a year - though that is thanks to a curse.
</li><li> The ghost Professor Binns, who is noted as being able to make "bloody giant wars seem dull and boring". Seems Hogwarts teachers never get fired, they just retire or die. Binns didn't let death stop him, and there's a rumor that he hasn't even noticed that he died, so Hogwarts students will forever be stunted in terms of their historical education. In turn, it probably made it a self-perpetuating problem, as no one likes/knows enough about magical history to qualify as a replacement.
</li><li> As a Seer, Sibyl Trelawney's got only two accurate predictions under her belt sprinkled among numerous failures, including predicting the deaths of a number of very much alive students over the years. As a teacher, she's got a similar record, which isn't helped by her untreated alcoholism. Save for Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, every single student she teaches doesn't take her seriously and they've been known to make up fake predictions just to pass her class, which they do because she doesn't realize they're making it up. Even the other members of the Hogwarts staff (even <em>Dumbledore</em>) doesn't respect her, as McGonagall makes no secret of the fact that she thinks Trelawney is a total fraud. It eventually turns out that Dumbledore wanted to get rid of the Dinivation classes a long time ago, but the Board of Governors and parents kept demanding it stay on the curriculum; he only relented when he hired Trelawney because he needed an excuse to keep her safe at Hogwarts to protect her from Voldemort since she was the one who made the prediction about his defeat. Furthermore, it's implied that being a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer">Seer</a> is something that you can't actually teach— even the far more competent Firenze basically says that it takes years to master; besides, most of the time, it doesn't even work, and most don't see much. You either have the gift or you don't.
</li><li> Severus Snape, while an unmistakable genius in the field of potion-making, is decidedly less qualified as a teacher. He consistently plays favorites with the Slytherin students and bullies and degrades any other students, particularly Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom (who is legitimately terrified of Snape). And at the <em>best</em> of times, Snape treats Harry with utter disdain for the things that happened between Snape and Harry's father before Harry was even <em>born</em>!
</li><li> Argus Filch, a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a> who's one step away from being a serial killer. He explicitly enjoys causing students pain because he's jealous that they're learning magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">while he's incapable of using it</a>. At no point is the idea of firing him ever entertained. As with the example of Binns, it's quite possible that no one else actually wants the job.
</li><li> Peeves also counts. Why don't they expel him? Really looks like Dumbledore wants a bit of weirdness in Hogwarts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Rowling</a> stated that Peeves is like bad plumbing; it always comes back. Dumbledore is just better with a spanner than most others. To clarify, Peeves is an incarnation of chaos. Get rid of Peeves, you'd have a new one appear soon after. It's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterTheDevilYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterTheDevilYouKnow">Better the Devil You Know</a>, because a new poltergeist might not be cowed by the Bloody Baron, or be occasionally loyal to the school.
</li></ul></li><li> In the novel <em>Red Square</em>, Arkady Renko asks a Russian defector working for Voice of America in West Germany why the American bosses don't fire him for his insubordination. The defector replies that they try to once a year but that German labor laws are designed so that Germany isn't stuck with a lot of unemployed foreigners, so they always fail to meet the legal requirements to do so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarAgainstTheChtorr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarAgainstTheChtorr">The War Against the Chtorr</a></em>. The Uncle Ira Group protects the protagonist Jim McCarthy despite him committing several acts liable for court martial (including desertion, assaulting a superior, leading renegades to a secret US military stockpile, appropriating military property and personnel, and summarily executing civilians) partly because he's good at his job, but also because McCarthy's habit of causing disruption can be turned to their political advantage.
</li><li> The hiring process for faculty members at Unseen University in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> is less "become an expert in your field", and more "find an empty room, turn up at meal times, and try to keep out of the way of students". This is because the job description of a Discworld wizard consists of "<em>not</em> using magic". On the Disc it is really not difficult at all to turn someone into a frog (though making them stay that way can be a bit more difficult); it is much <em>more</em> difficult <em>not</em> to turn everyone around you into frogs once you realize how easy it would be. Every time in history the wizards got off their collective asses and actually did stuff, horrible things happened, with frequent parallels being drawn between major magical conflicts and all-out nuclear war. The certifiably insane Bursar is probably the most extreme example, as he's still a member of the faculty even though he no longer has any significant control over his magic and is useless even for his nominal responsibility of keeping the University accounts (which is mostly done by Ponder Stibbons).
<ul><li> Speaking of Stibbons, he can't be fired either because of his practicality: he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneEmployee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneEmployee">one level-headed wizard</a> out of the bunch. This tendency causes him to take up the responsibilities other wizards aren't using, to the point where in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em> we discover he constitutes a faculty majority vote <em>all by himself.</em>

Why? Because he's the only one willing do it, especially since it was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a> to begin with.
</li><li> The eponymous organization in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles">The Laundry Files</a></em> hires most of its employees not due to their competence, a great need for employees, or them even applying for a job, but because it's been calculated that lifetime wages and pension for a low-level civil service job add up to less than the projected cost for the government to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledToUpholdTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledToUpholdTheMasquerade">assassinate one of its citizens who happened to stumbled upon the paranormal</a>. Once hired, they've ensured you're neutralized. If you want or are capable of being useful (to a widely varying degree of "useful"), that's good. But most employees aren't doing anything really worth doing, or get any opportunity to make mistakes with consequences beyond getting themselves killed. Which is also usually good. And the exceptions are, if not irreplacable, too valuable to let go of over anything not worth killing them for. Either way, the Laundry doesn't fire anybody for anything - or kill that many of its people either.

He can afford it because not only is he really good at his job, the authorities use his surgery services as well.

Because they're the only Western settlement in Australia and the next nearest settlement is months away by ship, the penal colony utterly depends on their one and only blacksmith Marston, to the extent that the Governor is willing to let other convicts starve to death in order to overlook Marston's food theft. It's only when Marston <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is killed by the person he was starving</span> that those in charge realise how ludicrously they behaved because they thought he was indispensable. When the replacement blacksmith <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is about to be shot</span>, <em>he</em> tries to pass himself off as indispensable, but Major Ross clearly wants to avoid this trope.

Presumably he was good enough at what he did (<em>i.e.</em> reading the news and acting as the face of the network), and in the latter seasons as Baxter's character was softened — at Ted Knight's request — the emphasis was less so on his mistakes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>: Pretty much everyone at Dunder Mifflin Scranton is pretty incompetent, and yet somehow the Scranton branch is the most profitable.
<ul><li> Michael and Dwight are the standouts, as both seem to exemplify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a> — they're absolutely amazing at selling paper and are rewarded for this with management positions, despite neither having the knowledge or temperament to actually <em>be</em> in management.
<ul><li> In Michael's case, his position as branch manager and his soft-hearted nature means everyone <em>else</em> there also has Ultimate Job Security (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Toby</a>).
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Michael:</strong> I don't want my employees to think their jobs depend on their performance.
</div><ul><li> In Dwight's case, even though he has an abrasive personality and gets away with things like keeping weapons at the office, he may be keeping his job out of pity — he's so pathetic that his accomplishments at Dunder Mifflin are the only thing he has at all in his life, and Michael at one point admits to Dwight that his position is a fabrication and he has no authority over any other employees (which causes him to have a near-breakdown). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> shows that once Dwight gets his life in order, his loony tendencies tone down significantly and he turns the company into the region's top paper supplier. And also, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shows no hesitation to fire Kevin and Toby for being incompetent</span>.
</li><li> It should be noted that Dwight has performed especially outrageous actions compared to his employees, with his actions ranging from causing a fire and a panic, to damaging private property in the form of vandalizing an expensive CPR dummy, to possessing and discharging a firearm in the workplace, to assaulting a fellow employee without due cause (Andy Bernard). Even though these incidents all got reported to the top echelons of Dunder-Mifflin, he still doesn't get fired. Even if he is one of the company's best salesmen, keeping him around simply should not be worth it to the company.
</li></ul></li><li> Andy apparently got the district manager his job, which earns him a promotion — and he immediately takes off for three months, lies about it, and gets away with it. However, while he avoids consequences from the manager, he loses a ton of respect from the other employees, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">consider his absence a precedent</a> and try it themselves.
<ul><li> He eventually defies this trope in the series' last few episodes, where he deliberately gets himself fired to pursue his dreams. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It doesn't go well.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Kevin only keeps his job because Michael likes him. He is the third accountant in an office that only needs two, and it becomes apparent that those other two do all the real work. When his work is finally audited, it is revealed that he balanced the books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion">inventing a number</a>.
</li><li> Jim Halpert, while not being as outrageous as Dwight or Andy, or nearly as stupid as Kevin, still is a notably mischievous employee, performing a large number of pranks that would normally be disapproved of in the workplace.
<ul><li> To be fair, many of his pranks tend to be targeted at Dwight, whom is one of the lesser-liked employees, and a few others at Andy, whom the office likes even less than Dwight. Not to mention that when he is threatened with termination by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Ryan</a> or got into hot water with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Charles Miner</a>, he visibly toned it back significantly.

He's also one of the best doctors in the world. Not only can he not be fired, but apparently he can't even be arrested. His job is threatened several times over the course of the show, but it is always saved because Wilson and Cuddy vouch for him and his ability to treat patients that no one else can. Cuddy mentions that the hospital gets House for cheap because no one else will bother to hire him, and that the savings are occasionally (but not always) used to pay for the lawsuits arising from House's antics. House himself believes that he can never lose total respect as long as he's a brilliant doctor, and cites his experience at a Japanese hospital where a doctor was made so "untouchable" as to become a janitor — and yet the other doctors kept asking him for advice because he was so brilliant.

He's not a bad administrator, but he has no real control over his camp. The prisoners' antics, on the other hand, contrive to make Klink look absolutely ruthless to his superiors, and Klink is also a magnificent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">ass-kisser</a>, which will very much endear you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>. Klink's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> Schultz is even <em>less</em> competent, to the point that the prisoners count him as an ally (he's in on it, though he wishes he wasn't) — but he's also an adept ass-kisser whose vast wealth as a toy manufacturer gives him some leverage. Both Klink and Schultz see their jobs threatened over the course of the show, only for the prisoners to maneuver to keep them around.

<ul><li> Todd is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">said to be</a> a very good surgeon; however, he spends most of his time sexually harassing the female staff.

He's a bully, constantly belittles both his patients and his subordinates, and he's a really good doctor. He <em>has</em> been disciplined — as early as the second episode he was suspended from the hospital — but he's never lost his job. Chalk this up to three reasons: <em>(1)</em> he's a <em>really</em> good doctor, <em>(2)</em> his ex-wife is on the hospital's board of directors, and <em>(3)</em> he ruthlessly advocates for his patients' health, which Kelso admits he uses as a balance to his own ruthless focus on the hospital's bottom line.
</li><li> Doug Murphy was such a poor physician that his ineptitude regularly resulted in patients dying. It got to the point where everyone in the hospital would call a major goof-up "a Doug". But they don't fire him — they send him to the morgue, and he becomes a brilliant pathologist from his experience of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">having caused</a> many of the things he's trying to diagnose.
</li><li> Ted, the sad-sack hospital lawyer, is most definitely not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> — he's repeatedly called incompetent and is to law what Doug is to medicine.

He spends most of his time messing with people or pulling pranks. Kelso doesn't particularly care what happens as long as things get done and the money rolls in, so the Janitor can do things like trap JD in a water tower for an entire day with no consequence. Tellingly, when Kelso retires, his replacement Dr. Maddox — who actually cares about these things — spots the Janitor trip JD in the hallway and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">fires him on the spot</a>.

This is due to her being popular with the patients, and Becker being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who owes her dad a lot of money. Ironically, when she took a vacation at work, she turned into a very competent employee.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, of the regular characters, only BJ and Potter <em>wouldn't</em> fall under this trope. Given the shortage of medical staff in the Korean War, this would appear to be an exaggerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> — and when a documentary on the show interviewed real MASH doctors, they said it wasn't even that exaggerated. Some details:
<ul><li> Hawkeye and Trapper are a pair of often-drunken and always-womanizing (although Hawkeye gets better) slackers who constantly play practical jokes on everyone else. But they're also exceptional doctors and pretty much the entire reason the unit's survival rate is as high as it is. In one episode Henry outright states that he would have fired them long ago if they weren't the two best surgeons in Korea, and this opinion comes to be shared by more than one guest-star general and, of course, by Henry's replacement Col. Potter.
</li><li> Henry himself is an indecisive, easily dominated scaredy-cat who has no business running a military unit — but he runs a <em>damn</em> good hospital and, again, is a top-flight surgeon himself.
</li><li> Margaret Houlihan is one of the most difficult people to get along with (especially at first), she tends to drive the other nurses in particular crazy, and she doesn't always make life easy for the doctors either (although she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">improves significantly</a> as the series goes on). But she's also probably the best nurse they could have when things get tough. Even Henry, who clashes with her on a regular basis, decides he can't let her go when she wants to leave, because she's just too important to the unit's success.
</li><li> Charles is a pompous, arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> who complains loudly about anything and everything and was seen making racial slurs toward the priest in one episode. But unlike his predecessor Frank Burns, he's actually a very competent (if slow) surgeon, with cardiac expertise the others lack.
</li><li> Radar, the company clerk, is childish to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, sleeps with a teddy bear, and keeps unauthorized pets, but he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a> with an uncanny ability to anticipate the Colonel's needs, to the point that he's often running things himself (see Henry above).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Klinger</a> is <em>trying</em> to get booted from Korea, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">no one is willing to oblige him</a>. It turns out that in spite of his antics and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">constant crossdressing</a>, for all the things he does to get out of the Army, he won't do anything that would actually compromise the unit's ability to give the wounded the best care possible — even when he pretends he thinks he's in Toledo, he still helps with the wounded, claiming they're all victims of a bad traffic accident. When Radar leaves, Klinger is promoted to Company Clerk and continues to prove his worth.
</li><li> Frank Burns is the biggest question mark. He's a greedy, lying, manipulative coward who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">sticks to the letter of the law in a manner guaranteed to make things worse</a>, and who's also so incompetent as a surgeon that he shouldn't even be allowed to play the "Operation" board game. In one episode, the writers tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> this by claiming he cheated on his medical school exams. It's also strongly implied that the nurses and the other surgeons — all of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDoctor">Determined Doctor</a> s to the nth degree — save him from the worst of his medical screw-ups out of compassion for his unfortunate patients.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">Agent Mulder</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, and to a lesser extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a> and Skinner. Averted when he got a less understanding boss than Skinner.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a>, and in the military you have to suffer people with irreplaceable skills no matter how insubordinate they are, so you'll see a lot of people like this who like to butt heads with people and get away with it. The biggest example is Jack O'Neill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, who gets away with talkback, insubordination, and disobeying orders. If he were in the real U.S. Air Force, he would have been court-martialed at least six times over. But they evidently really need him, considering they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryUnretirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryUnretirement">dragged him out of retirement</a> to lead the team — he can, after all, keep score of how often he's saved the planet. Hammond apparently keeps a file on O'Neill's behaviour — seen in the episode where he <em>actually</em> gets court-martialed (but it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">part of a sting operation</a>) — but he also seems to be good friends with O'Neill and willing to look the other way due to the SGC's secretive nature.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> it's common for characters to <em>assault</em> superiors whom they disagree with or suspect of wrongdoing, and you'd expect to wind up in prison for that, but they're still working there when the dust clears. CTU's turnover remains high, though, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">other reasons</a>.
</li><li> Harmon Rabb from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> is quite prone to this. Half the stunts he's pulled should have had him drummed out of the Navy, or at least left him with very poor chances of promotion. No matter how egregious the stunts he pulls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>.

Kirk consistently puts himself and most of his senior officers in danger in mission after mission. He takes them on landing parties, makes liberal use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyDiplomacy">Cowboy Diplomacy</a>, disobeys direct orders from his superiors, and treats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimeDirective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimeDirective">Prime Directive</a> — the Federation's most serious rule, which Starfleet personnel must protect with everything up to and including their lives — as a suggestion. Any real ship's captain who behaves even remotely like Kirk would be instantly court-martialed and at the very least permanently stripped of command authority. But he also has a job where one wrong move could lead to the end of human civilization, and he's proven to be very good at it. His crew is also very loyal to him and will back him up if anything goes wrong. Interestingly, Kirk <em>is</em> court-martialed in one episode, for something very minor compared to what he gets away with on a regular basis, and his superiors still make it a point to mention how good a starship captain he is. In the films, they do actually remove him from the captain's chair by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">giving him a promotion and sending him to Earth</a>, but by then he acknowledges that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingTheirAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingTheirAge">getting to old for this anyway</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> plays with the trope — Janeway states at one point that if someone like Kirk had been a Starfleet officer during the show's time, he's have been kicked out long ago. However, at another point Chakotay mentions that there are always a few young officers who prove to be unsuited for deep-space duty as early as their first starship assignment, but sticky situations happen so often that you have to keep these guys as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot">Closest Thing We Got</a>.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>: Sisko's aggressive behavior, questionable antics, and use of biological weaponry should have had him court-martialed even by the show's standards. But he's also the commander of the figurative Fort Apache in space and the literal Messiah of the Bajroans, so it's not as if they can replace him. It's suggested that Starfleet specifically assigns Sisko to jobs like this (<em>e.g.</em> the Maqui rebellion, which was politically tricky because it was led by Starfleet defectors). By the end of the war, he's the <em>de facto</em> head of the alliance and most powerful man in the quadrant, his direct superiors accept his "recommendations" so often you'd think their positions were reversed, the Klingon Chancellor is a personal friend of his, and the Romulans tend to go along with him too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>: The team seems to get leeway from its director as a matter of course, especially in the early seasons. NCIS was introduced as a small underfunded organization that had to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">creative methods</a> to stay ahead of its bigger and more popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">rivals</a> like the FBI. So naturally, its members can get away with a lot, some more than others:
<ul><li> Leroy Jethro Gibbs stands out because as the team leader, he uses his clout to insulate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">everyone else</a> from <em>their</em> antics. He, on the other hand, doesn't have that luxury, and yet he treats all orders from above as polite suggestions — at best. On two occasions, he's expressly defied the direct orders of the Secretary of the Navy for the purpose of doing it <em>his</em> way. But he's also <em>very</em> effective at his job, and the only reason they don't make him NCIS director is that he <em>really</em> doesn't want the job — but he's usually very close to whomever <em>is</em> in the director's chair (especially Jenny) or at least has a lot of dirty laundry on them (in Vance's case).
</li><li> Resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabRat">Lab Rat</a> Abby stands out as well. She has strange tastes in everything, never wears a uniform, and treats every order from above like Gibbs does — except if it's from Gibbs himself. However, she's also supposedly one of the single most gifted forensic scientists in the country, and all the other agencies want her pretty badly, so NCIS is never going to let her leave — and they're lucky she doesn't want to leave either. Shepherd once tried to make her follow the rules, and it lasted until Gibbs found out about it.
</li><li> One episode features a large group of Navy codebreakers who all have various mental disorders — neuroses, paranoia, whatever — and their commanding officer flat out states that most of them would fail the military psychological exam. But he keeps them around because they're the best there is at what they do.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Schemer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em> somehow manages to keep his job as the eponymous station's arcade manager, despite being an obnoxious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who's not above lying, cheating, and occasionally even stealing to earn a few extra nickels. In one episode, he even takes other people's belongings without asking them and tries to sell them. And yet, the worst Stacy Jones (who runs the station) or J.B. King (the head of the railroad) do to him is tell him he's been bad and not to do it again. It's later revealed that Schemer isn't even an employee of the station — he just leases the space for the arcade from the railroad — but he seems to be doing well enough that it's not worth terminating his lease.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyHero">My Hero</a></em>, Mrs. Raven's open hostility to patients (and everyone else) might have been a problem for her were her boss not perpetually distracted by his own self-admiration. Also, as Dr. Crispin finds out after temporarily firing her for wanting a raise, she's made herself indispensable by organizing his patients' files in such a way that she's the only one who knows how to find anything.
</li><li> For quite a while, Mr. Lucas, the cheeky junior salesman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed">Are You Being Served?</a></em>, was able to get away with insulting his higher-ranked fellow employees and superiors every episode. Then, later on, he disappeared from the show. The only hint of an explanation for his disappearance was a passing line from Captain Peacock mentioning a time where the store didn't make any money and they fired the junior. This line was meant to intimidate Mr. Lucas' successor, Mr. Spooner — who managed to get away with insulting Mrs. Slocombe and Captain Peacock (though without Lucas' panache) until the final episode of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ianto kept a Cyberman in the Hub's basement (directly endangering the world) and disobeyed orders to shoot her. But he still manages to stay on the team.
</li><li> In a season 1 episode, Gwen takes the newly-resurrected Suzie out of the Torchwood Three base to see her father. Upon seeing this on a camera, Jack mentions that she is "getting herself fired", but she ultimately remains part of the team. Likely because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzie was manipulating her</span>.
</li><li> The season 1 finale involved the entire team — having been driven over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> — having a mutiny against Captain Jack. Owen even goes as far as to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoot Jack in the head, killing him. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Jack</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">can't die</a>, but Owen doesn't know that</span>. Their actions afterwards unleash a giant monster upon the city, though Jack ends up stopping it. Despite the fact that he told them many times not to open the Rift (which led to the aforementioned incidents), he forgives his entire team.
</li><li> Justified in the opening credits — Torchwood is "outside the government, beyond the police." Jack is pretty much autonomous once Torchwood London at Canary Wharf goes down.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>: The entire office seemed to have this.
<ul><li> Don Draper can disappear from work for days without any long-term consequences. However (as Duck Phillips discovers to his dismay), Don doesn't have a <em>contract</em>, and thus no "non-compete" clause — so if he were fired, he could just bolt to another ad agency and take all his client knowledge with him. This is then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in the sixth season, by which point Don <em>does</em> have a contract and his dysfunctions finally <em>aren't</em> worth his contributions to the company, as he's gone months without bringing in a major account and immediately loses the only one he does bring in — but he's also a partner in the agency, so the others can't get rid of him without buying him out (which they can't afford) and can only force him to take a leave of absence.
</li><li> Don discovers that he can't have Pete Campbell fired for endangering an account because Campbell's family is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">wealthy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">well-connected</a>.
</li><li> One employee is openly dismissive of Madison Square Garden's plan to tear down the old Penn Station — while the agency is attempting to land the Garden as a client. Not only is he not fired, he's not even taken off the account.
</li><li> A secretary runs over a guy's foot with a lawnmower in the office. Nothing happens to her.
</li></ul></li><li> First footman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later under-butler</span> Thomas Barrow from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> is a thieving, manipulative and overall unpleasant character, but he's actually good at the job, so nobody has the heart to fire him. Each season ends with him weaseling his way out of a situation he really shouldn't have been able to weasel out of, and then getting promoted. The third season ends with him being outed as gay <em>in 1920</em> and managing to not only stay out of jail, but be promoted from valet to under-butler.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>: The entire crew commits what should be career-ending offenses on an alarmingly routine basis. Starbuck may be a great pilot, but her unpredictability would cause any leader to lose faith in her during one of her less lucid moments. Apollo disobeys orders on a routine basis and ends up getting promoted. Tyrol essentially commits mutiny and is outright told he would have been executed if he weren't needed. Even Adama gets stoned and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has an affair with the president</span>. This is deliberate; the <em>Galactica</em> would have been decommissioned were it not for the Cylon invasion, it's implied to be a dumping ground for the Colonial military's least effective personnel, and Adama and Tigh are given command of it as punishment for screwing up an intelligence operation (and they would have been kicked out of the Fleet outright were it not for Adama's wife's political ties). The whole ship is thus essentially a frat house. It's the great irony of the series that it's also the only warship of consequence to survive the apocalypse.
</li><li> A major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> is that it is practically impossible for a civil servant to lose their job, regardless of how incompetent, malicious, or damaging their conduct. As such, whilst the politicians come and go, the civil servants are there practically for life, which given the turnover among the politicians themselves makes them instrumental in actually running the country.
</li><li> Detective Stabler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> routinely ignores <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Capt.

But he is one of the best detectives on the force with a ridiculously high closure rate. Even when he does get fired, it doesn't stick because his new Captain pulls some strings to give him back his badge.
</li><li> Patrick Jane of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em> breaks laws left and right in his methods of solving murder cases. He's a pretty shady <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> and breeds trouble, yet the agency wouldn't dare fire him because he's just that good. However, every antic of his brings his supervisor, Agent Lisbon, closer to being fired in favor of someone actually able to control him — except when they <em>actually</em> fire her, they learn the hard way that Jane is unwilling to work with anyone else. It's uncertain whether they even <em>can</em> get rid of Jane, as he's not really an employee. Ironically, Jane's investigation into the Red John case — his whole motive for working with the CBI — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets the CBI disbanded, getting him <em>and</em> everyone else fired</span>. But then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the FBI hires him, he makes them hire Lisbon, and the cycle repeats</span>.
</li><li> Miles Hutchison, the Secretary of Defense on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, holds the President in open contempt, attempts to screen promotion candidates based on their political views, and uses the media to undermine foreign policy initiatives so frequently that Bartlet and Leo attempt to plan around it. He lasts the entire length of the series.

At one point, the Chief actually does threaten to fire him, and Max replies that the Chief wouldn't dare, as according to CONTROL's seniority regulations, if Max is fired, then the Chief would have to promote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Larabee</a> into Max's job. Also, Max is the local steward for CONTROL's branch of the spy union.

They offered her money, but she insisted on her shitty job.
</li><li> Buffy is given a job as a guidance counselor at the new Sunnydale High School in the seventh season. The reason for her hiring was so she could protect the students from the Hellmouth under the school. Good thing, too, because we are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">shown and told</a> that she isn't a great counselor. Whenever she asks about her great counseling skills, the person she is talking to gets an amused look on their face. And whenever she is seen talking to a student, she seems prone to thinking so much about the monster-fighting part of her job to properly listen to what the students say.

Corporal Agarn is a hyperactive Frank Burns who is also O'Rourke's business partner. The bugler can't play a tune, the lookout has 20/400 vision, and no one can fire the cannon without hitting the lookout tower.

We also see him help his ex-wife replace money she stole from the evidence locker, moonlight as a bounty hunter (which Raylan is explicitly warned is against Marshal rules and grounds for immediate termination), and arrange the execution of a mob boss that threatened his family. His boss describes why he keeps him around despite Raylan's tendency to break the rules to deliver justice as he sees fit:

It all comes to a head in "The Millennium," in which he <em>tries</em> to get fired so that he can accept an under-the-table offer to scout for the Mets and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">is unable to commit an offense flagrant enough to do the job</a> (for example, messily eating strawberries while wearing Babe Ruth's uniform is read as a valuable commentary on how the team needs to look forward to the future instead of worshipping dead idols).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> spent most of his time beating up his boss (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>), humiliating him, ruining his prize possessions, etc., just to get a rise out of him. How he kept his job varied by storyline; either Vince kept him on just to make his life a living hell right back, or he kept him on because, regardless of the fact that he was absolutely miserable, he was still making tons of money because the fans adored Austin, or an independent authority figure (the commissioner, the board of directors, etc.) would thwart Vince's latest attempt to get rid of him.
<ul><li> There was actually a storyline where Vince did get so sick of Austin and all the problems he caused that he fired Austin, proclaiming that even the buyrates and money weren't worth it anymore. Austin actually showed up the next night in an infamous segment where Austin threatened McMahon with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">gun</a>, only to reveal it was a toy. In retaliation, Vince hatched a plot where he pretended to feud with his son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a>. In retaliation for demoting Shane to lowly referee status, Shane revealed he had signed Austin to a five year contract. Eventually, they revealed their plan while screwing Austin out of a title match using Shane's new found referee power. The point of this plan was to make the next five years of Austin's life a living hell.
</li><li> This could apply to Austin in real life as well. Since 2002, he's walked out on WWE on multiple occasions, usually over gripes about where he was being put in a storyline, forcing WWE to officially "part ways" with him (one such incident caused him to lose a multi-picture deal with WWE's Films division). He also has been charged with assaulting women on at least a couple of occasions, not making for good PR. Still, despite all that and him not being in a match since 2003 due to his broken-down body, WWE will keep bringing him back for any small appearance because they know the crowd will always erupt upon hearing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">sound of broken glass</a>.

HHH, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky; while he avoided being fired for the incident, he did lose out on an opportunity to win the 1996 King of the Ring tournament (this instead went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>) and spent some time doing penance as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">jobber-to-the-stars</a>.

The crap he gets up to on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> <em>alone</em> would get any other employee fired — besides spoiling major events on WWE programming mere <em>moments</em> before they actually happen, he regularly and happily insults much of the stuff WWE has put out, including WWECW, and acknowledges (and rips on) on several WWE-considered nonentities such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>. It seems the <em>only</em> reason Vince doesn't just outright fire him is because the mutants would burn WWE Headquarters in a fit of rage the next day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>. WWE released him due to health concerns, including a refusal to go into rehab for his painkiller addiction. He promptly jumped ship to TNA, where he got arrested no less than five times, four of which involved being pulled over for a DUI, before finally checking into rehab on his own. Angle had been TNA World Heavyweight Champion at least one of those times, and was booked to retain the title in spite of this. If it had been any other performer (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a>, who got fired after <em>one</em> DWI), they would have been shown out the door <em>ages</em> ago. But since Angle is arguably the biggest star in TNA, he got away with a lot more than any company, WWE included, would have allowed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> had this for a while. His massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a> often prevented him from getting fired or from getting de-pushed — especially in TNA. Then <em>Victory Road 2011</em> happened, Jeff was sent home, and when he came back, he was told this would be his last chance. He's managed to stay on the wagon since then.
</li><li> As detailed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW">The Death of WCW</a></em>, by the late 90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott Steiner</a> was an unstable, rage-fuelled crazy person who: got legitimately arrested multiple times, was almost certainly abusing steroids, ran down the company and his coworkers in unscripted promos on Nitro, threatened executives and came close to <em>blinding</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage">Diamond Dallas Page</a> in a backstage shoot. As one of the last few remaining proven draws the company had during its dying years, he continued to be pushed as a main event star, and was often punished by short suspensions with pay, effectively receiving a paid vacation every time his behaviour became <em>really</em> bad.

The New Year's special with Paula Abdul indicates that the reason he keeps his job is because his fellow band-members, Paws and Growler, are in awe of him, considering a far better drummer than anyone else in the world. Also, their previous drummers had even more serious problems, so basically they're happy to have him because despite his issues, they could be dealing with worse problems.

<ul><li> Rayne. He got a job as an executive at a multi-national corporation, with the goal of sleeping with the hot female CEO. He routinely sexually harasses all his female co-workers, including the aforementioned CEO and her assistant. He has climbed through the office's air vents ("You'll appreciate it if and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Hans Gruber</a> shows up"), climbed the building with a homemade grappling hook when the lift was out, come to work dressed as a Stormtrooper (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, not Nazi) and once had a prospective employee used as a pinata. He keeps his job, because he's somehow increased company profits to record levels, and his perverseness/immaturity/loose grasp of reality seems to be seen by every other character as amusing or endearing. Yes, he's an outrageous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>, but that's sort of the joke.
</li><li> It's interesting to note that this trope also applies to the aforementioned prospective employee. Despite being a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to everyone at the company ("So what's it like to be on the other side of the poverty line?"), including and especially his interviewer (Rayne himself), he <em>still</em> gets the job because he has all the practical skills required. One can only assume that the world of LICD has <em>extremely</em> strict equal opportunity employment laws. The selling point with "Archie" was that for all his stuck-up rich snob attitude, he had the skills, education and prospect ideas to really benefit the company. Even Rayne had to admit his proposals were sound, much as he wanted to kick the kid out the door anyway. We haven't seen much of him since, but presumably he keeps his attitude tightly reined in for fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">what Rayne might do to him.</a>

Not only does he keep his job, he ends up OWNING the damn place. Though that last one is justified because Ethan was holding the deed, and the previous owner flat-out didn't care.
</li><li> Davan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em> can always keep his job as a medical bill clerk. This is because his job is so horrible that probably no one else would want to apply for it, and because he is the only one left in his group who <em>actually does any work</em>. He realizes this power when he oversleeps in one comic, and after a split-second of believing he'll be fired, promptly goes back to sleep.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile">Misfile</a></em> it's getting increasingly hard to understand why Ash's father is still a doctor, much less employed.

His teaching job, meanwhile, is a straight example: he gets hired due to mistaken identity and keeps his job even though he rarely actually teaches English and constantly endangers the lives of his students and himself. This is repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Junko</a>.

Contrast this with Faye, who appeared to play this trope straight by maintaining employment at Coffee of Doom despite being openly abusive to customers (justified in-universe by having the customers actually <em>enjoy</em> her abuse) and her co-workers, but finally crossed the line and lost her job when she showed up to work drunk and was caught topping up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickNip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickNip">Quick Nip</a>.

He's grossly incompetent, monstrously stupid, and frequently leaves his job to pursue insane "lifelong dreams" and spur-of-the-moment opportunities. Yet no matter how badly he screws up, even if he leaves, even if he's <em>fired</em>, he always comes back. The show has offered several explanations for why this is:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> — to an extreme degree. After all of Homer's antics, his boss Monty Burns always needs to be reminded who this "Simpson" character is.
</li><li> If Homer were competent, he'd have the entire plant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">shut down</a> — which is exactly what he does in "HOMR", where he picks up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome">"Flowers for Algernon" Syndrome</a>.

In other episodes, Burns is seen actively resisting giving Homer training for this reason.
</li><li> The plant employees have a powerful union, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs, and Nuclear Technicians</a>, and Homer is behind only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Smithers</a> on the seniority list.

<ul><li> Until the sex abuse scandal involving former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was made public, Penn State University football coach Joe Paterno had <em>the</em> ultimate job security. Minor infractions with the NCAA, disagreements with the administration, several successive poor seasons and underachieving teams ... none of that seemed to matter until Sandusky's arrest in November 2011. When the facts became clear, Paterno  who had been the head coach since 1966, and part of the coaching staff from 1950-1965  was quickly outed for failure to show leadership and refer an alleged incident involving the sexual assault of a child (which purportedly was reported to him) to law enforcement.
</li><li> The U.S. Supreme Court. While it is technically possible to impeach and remove someone from the office of justice of the Supreme Court, the last time it was attempted was when Justice Samuel Chase was impeached in <em>1804</em>. He was acquitted. Effectively, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericaTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericaTheBook">the icy scythe of death</a> snips judges out of office.
<ul><li> That being said, it's not unheard of for Supreme Court justices to resign of their own volition before their term is up, usually because they are so old they can't be sure they'll survive the next President's term and don't want to die when their political opponents are in charge of replacing them.
</li><li> Impeachment (attempted or otherwise) against United States federal judges at any level is quite rare, to the point where it's basically unheard of. Eight have actually been removed, and three resigned under pressure after proceedings began.
</li></ul></li><li> Most nations have some mechanism that makes it very difficult to dismiss judges, in order to prevent the executive or legislature dismissing judges who make decisions they don't like. Whilst it doesn't always translate into this trope, it can. The great British judge Lord Denning stayed on the bench until he was 83, by which point his mental faculties were...patchy.
</li><li> This mentality and how it happens in real life was lampshaded by Jaison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a>: Samoa</em>, where he said that every job had two people like Natalie and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Russell Hantz</a>. Russell Hantz was that person who was very good at the job but is <em>clearly</em> not working there to make friends, and is naturally the person who only cares about work and nothing more. Natalie meanwhile is the person who's there to make friends and is invited to all the office parties - and keeps the morale going because people <em>want</em> to work with them.
</li><li> Computer programmers sometimes jokingly call poor coding practices and examples thereof "Job Security". The reasoning is that they can't fire you if you're the only one who understands the code enough to maintain it. People who attempt to take advantage of it will either code in round-about methods or maintain traps and back doors to ensure that nobody else can do their job.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that tech companies have gotten smart about this and will fire someone on the spot for attempting this. There are strict guidelines about code syntax to make it easy to read, and breaking them is grounds for immediate termination, precisely because they don't want to lose six months of work upon replacing the only person who understands the program. If your coding sucks and you're new or they're desperate for help, they <em>may</em> give you one chance to clean it up. That is, unless it's obvious that it's intentionally bad in order to give yourself job security or your bad coding resulted in something getting seriously messed up. Even then, it's a matter of "you have one chance to make this right and stop coding incompetently, as we're all sick of maintaining what <em>does</em> work and fixing what doesn't after we figure out what you're even trying to do with it".
</li><li> In 2008, Governator Schwarzenegger ordered the firing of every temporary and part-time employee of the State of California, and the reduction of the survivors' pay to minimum wage. Only then did he discover that the only people who knew the state's payroll software well enough to implement the latter directive had been victims of the former...
</li><li> As a joke goes, programmers never retire, they just move to consulting about systems written in outdated programming languages.
</li><li> The above explains why Gerald Weinberg, in <em>The Psychology of Computer Programming</em> (written in the 1970s, and still applicable), states that if a programmer becomes indispensable, you should fire him immediately. On the other hand, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Jackson">Michael A. Jackson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tells of bosses who find indecipherable complexity a sign of genius and simple and elegant solutions just dumb luck.
</li><li> This can be a problem at the academic level if you have a professor who teaches students to find their own coding style and go with what works best for them. This is one of the <em>worst</em> things that you can teach; while it is good to figure out a style that works for you, it's imperative to make sure that others can understand it; professors who see bizarre coding styles as something to be embraced rather than corrected are setting students up for a long line of job-related difficulties. As many a veteran programmer has said, "you may have a style that's all yours, but I don't want to be the one who gets stuck having to maintain it".
</li></ul></li><li> Computer System Administrators. Bitter, angry, many bordering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">insanity</a>. On the other hand, you don't want to fire someone who has root-access to your computer system unless you really really have to.
</li><li> Tenure for academics is not quite this, but it's very, very close. Although granting it is supposed to be based on credentials and accomplishments (and limit favoritism and arbitrary dismissals as well as foster loyalty), it's not uncommon for members of a tenure-granting board to try to block people they don't like from becoming tenured just because it means they'll be stuck with them as coworkers for the foreseeable future - sometimes decades.
<ul><li> Example: It can take as long as seven years and $350,000 dollars to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/36802.html">fire only one incompetent teacher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the New York City Public Schools.
</li><li> Another example: Los Angeles Unified School District has a policy of 'housing' teachers accused of being unfit for their jobs - placing them on indefinite paid leave, as opposed to firing them or putting them in non-teaching duties (this is based upon management's interpretation of the teacher contract, and, well, not wanting people to do jobs they aren't qualified for). A 2009 case involved Matthew Kim, a former Special Education teacher with Cerebral Palsy, who had been on the payroll for seven years since being removed from teaching over a sexual harassment accusal, costing the school district $2 million in salary and legal fees over that time without either teaching or otherwise performing work for LA Unified (though, to be clear, much of that figure comes from the murky results of the lawsuit Kim filed alleging he had been specifically targeted because of his handicapped status). Of course, the counter-argument is that <em>accused</em> is the key word, and that any public employee has the right to appeal to an independent body. (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-teachers6-2009may06,0,1697213,full.story">story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> At the university level, all that tenure is <em>supposed</em> to mean is that a tenured prof can only be fired "for cause" and after "due process." In practice, over time, faculty senates and unions have defined "cause" so narrowly that even felonies may not be covered. Further, due process in a state university can involve appeals all the way up to the state's governor, who is the ultimate titular head of many such systems.
</li></ul></li><li> It is nearly impossible to fire some people from their day jobs because they are prominent members of unions. If the company does fire them, then they can expect the union to pull out all the stops, much more so than firing a normal union member. That said, if the employee's union decides that someone else could do their job in the union better, they are no longer protected.
</li><li> This is a major issue for police in America, due to the fact that the police union is one of the few that remains significantly strong and retains favor with the government, and most of the people who would investigate and punish wrongdoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen">are police or police-aligned organizations themselves.</a> On top of that, settlements are typically paid by the city rather than the police department, meaning departments tend to avoid the worst of consequences when their officers do screw up badly, giving them little incentive to punish them. Even massively publicized instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a> tend to result in paid suspension or reassignment to another precinct or department at most.
</li><li> In Japan, labor laws make it quite hard to outright fire an employee. So instead the company would gradually relieve the employee of duties (and the associated pay), until he resigns.
</li><li> Job security in Sweden has been criticized for being ultimate. This is not quite true - the law recognizes dismissal on the grounds of harassing your co-workers or gross misconduct - but we're talking really bad stuff here, like endangering other people. It is doubtful whether you can be fired for slacking around. If the employee in question is friends with the worker's union, most employers find it easier to buy them off, as they (the employers) will face lawsuits or strikes otherwise. Oh, and even when doing layoffs, you don't get to decide who stays and who has to go. The law says that the employee hired last has to be fired first. All this goes only for salaried workers, while temps and hourlies can be more easily laid off. And then the unions wonder why employers tend to avoid employing on a monthly basis whenever possible.
</li><li> The banking system in general: Even after a string of notorious crashes and bailouts, nearly everyone in any position of responsibility still has their job, having created a financial system so complex that no individual could either fully understand its machinations, or be held particularly responsible for its dysfunction, and all those who come closest are probably already employed in the system. It's a really, really crappy situation for anyone not in such a position. Which is to say, pretty much every other taxpayer.
<ul><li> This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">Vetinari Job Security</a>: any other system to manage financing in a modern economy would be just as complicated.
</li></ul></li><li> Public jobs in Brazil: you're unlikely to get fired unless you royally screw things up (e.g. are caught stealing from your workplace).
<ul><li> Likewise <em>fonctionnaires</em> (civil servants) in France. The general perception being that they do no work and have a truckload of perks, but are essentially impossible to fire.
</li><li> A lot of the problems with Greece's finances stem from their civil servants enjoying this trope.
</li><li> It is also present in Germany, but is compensated for with civil servants being forbidden from unionizing and having to accept whatever the government feels like paying them.
</li><li> And in Britain, much to the chagrin of the British military, who usually bear the brunt of budget cuts and are known for having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">George Jetson Job Security</a>. After a cock-up left the British Army with a completely useless assault rifle, they nicknamed it "the Civil Servant": it doesn't work and it can't be fired.
</li><li> Note that this can also lead to frustration among the public servants themselves, at least the ones who care about actually doing a good job. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Beleaguered Bureaucrats</a> who are forced to spend a lot of time cleaning up the messes their coworkers make would be just as happy to see the incompetents shown the door, rather than have to keep putting up with them.
</li></ul></li><li> Hans-Ulrich Lutz, a pilot with the now-defunct Swiss airline Crossair, managed to keep his job despite several on-the-job blunders-such as retracting the landing gear of a plane while it was still on the ground and nearly landing at the wrong airport due to a navigation error. Unfortunately, this would come back to bite Crossair when Lutz <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossair_Flight_3597">crashed a plane near Zurich,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> killing himself along with 23 other passengers and crew.

</li><li> This is quoted (by one part of the political spectrum) as one of the main reasons of unemployment in private companies in France. Nobody wants to hire because, unless your employee commits an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> that potentially endangers the company or actively tries to sink it, you have to go through a precise legal procedure where even a tiny mistake (such as sending a letter too soon) can result in a trial against you (the guy will still need a very good lawyer in case of a major blunder, though). If the employee can prove he/she's been fired due to a bias of the employer (discrimination, minor fault, etc.), in 99 cases out of 100, you'll have to re-hire the employee or pay very large fines and severance packages.
</li><li> James St. James, a Millikin University professor who turned out to have murdered his father, mother and sister back when he was 15, yet was allowed to keep his job and remained popular with his students even after this fact was revealed.
</li><li> Averted in characteristic fashion in the Soviet Union under Stalin - the idea was that if anyone made themselves indispensable, it was time to dispense of them because they were working against Soviet ideals and trying to take advantage of others and their expertise. But it was more like Stalin wanted to get rid of anyone who could ever hope to be a threat. This caused predictable problems in fields like wartime intelligence.
<ul><li> This backfired horribly when the Germans invaded in World War II. The competent military leaders had all been purged or reassigned to Siberia as it was assumed they posed a threat. When the Germans invaded, the results were disastrous, and only the size of the Soviet Union kept them from being overrun. After the war, most were quickly reassigned back, but some like Marshal Zhukov were too good, and popular, to get rid of.
</li><li> Played straight at the same time - sure, it was easy to get arrested in USSR, but getting fired was a much bigger challenge; one tiny mistake made by your HR department, and you can force your way back in. This resulted in a common practice, which continues even in modern Russia, of employers trying their best to reach some sort of understanding with employees and convince them to resign of their own volition, rather than go through a complicated legal process.

</div></li><li> Ike Perlmutter, chairman (formerly CEO) of Marvel Entertainment, appears to have this. He has acquired such a stake in Marvel thanks to his toy company helping the comic company get out of bankruptcy that Disney can't fire him despite virtually no one in the company liking him thanks to his excessively cheap ways (Mickey Rourke was originally offered just $250K to co-star in Iron Man 2) and less-than-subtle bigotry (it was reportedly his doing that there were few Black Widow toys for years, and he said all black people look the same as his excuse for replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle as War Machine). The best Disney could do was restructure Marvel Studios in 2015 so Kevin Feige is now completely in charge of the movies and reports directly to Disney's chairman, leaving Perlmutter to just run the comics side of Marvel.
</li><li> Jeff Fisher, Head Coach of the St. Louis/LA Rams and, before them, the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans. With the exception of two seasons, he's been a Head Coach since 1995. In that time, he has had 6 playoff appearances (of which he's lost 3 times in the first round). He's had a .500 record or lower in 16 of his seasons as a head coach. He has also not had a record above .500 since 2008, spanning his final 2 seasons in Tennessee, and his last 4 in St. Louis/LA, and not including the current (2016) season. Overall, his coaching record with both is barely above .500. For comparison, following the 2015 season, former Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was fired (or rather asked to resign) for having 3 consecutive sub-.500 seasons and 1 playoff appearance in 7 years, despite having won 2 Super Bowls with the Giants. In 2016, Jeff Fisher received a contract extension in the middle of what will be a 5th consecutive sub-.500 season with the Rams.
<div class="indent"><strong>Eric Dickerson</strong>: Ill say it again; where are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">naked pictures</a>? Who has them? Because something is going on here to hire this guy back again for another two seasons.
</div></li><li> A rather negative example of this trope. Until Buzzfeed published an article about it during the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, this was the case with former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> editor Eddie Berganza. He was a serial sexual-harasser, and was reported to their HR department, but very little action was taken against him. This went on for over a <em>decade</em> until the aforementioned article gave DC enough of a bad publicity to <em>finally</em> fire him in November 2017.
</li><li> Several comic book writers remain employed despite the low quality of their work and unprofessional conduct towards fans.
<ul><li> The industry was hurting over a decade ago and never fully recovered from the collapse of the 90's, and all the writing talent moved on to independent work, so these companies hired the cheapest talent they could find - the aforementioned writers. In the grand scheme of things, monthly books are a single-digit percentile of Marvel's IP (DC is very much the same). The comic books exist for the sole purpose to 'pad the shelves'.
<p></p></li><li> Most of these writers believed that by the time it got to that point, their pet projects would have TV/Movie deals and they'd have steady royalties from that. They also believed that if Marvel or DC cut them- they'd have work elsewhere.
<p></p></li><li> That is why they were so absurdly volatile on Social Media; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">they didn't have 'an agenda', they wanted to draw attention to themselves and they knew that hitting these hot-button topics and lashing out on divisive topics would draw focus to them</a>, and thus the odds of that Movie/TV deal got better, exponentially.
<p></p></li><li> This behavior is potentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">coming back to bite them</a> due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic requiring self-quarantine; money is scarce and big publishers are stopping most work on comics. These writers now have to self-publish instead of depending on Marvel or DC to foot their bills.
