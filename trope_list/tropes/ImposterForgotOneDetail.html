This is likely because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cats, and - by extension - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girls</a>, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorBlindConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorBlindConfusion">colorblind</a></span>. Not that it really matters, since the person they were trying to fool had never seen Nanoha or Fate in their Barrier Jackets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: Envy does this a lot.
<ul><li> Hughes is able to realize that Maria Ross is being impersonated by Envy because she doesnt have her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark">mole</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This doesnt save him from being killed, nor does it save Ross from being framed for his murder</span>.
</li><li> Riza Hawkeye also has an encounter with Envy late in the story, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>weaponizes</em> this trope. Envy disguises himself as Roy Mustang and addresses her as "Lieutenant." She pulls her gun on 'him,' saying that she knows 'he' is a fake because when she and Mustang are alone, he calls her by her first name. Envy immediately drops the disguise out of shock, at which point she calmly announces, "I lied. Thanks for falling for it."</span>
</li><li> Happens when Envy fights Ling. The homunculus ends up on the ground, and as Ling gets ready to attack, Envy transforms into Lan-Fan to catch him off guard. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lan-Fan had recently lost an arm but, having not seen her in said state, Envy's form has two</span>. This is still enough to rattle Ling who freezes long enough for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gluttony to launch an attack</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> A Rain Ninja impersonating Naruto puts his shuriken holster on the wrong side (having a different dominant hand) and doesnt include the cut Naruto got from Anko. Sasuke says this lack of attention to detail makes the Rain Ninja worse than Naruto.
</li><li> Directly after this incident, Sasuke makes up a long and complicated password to serve as the one detail. Orochimaru later disguises himself as Naruto and recites the password perfectly. Sasuke immediately realizes that he's an impostor, as he forgot that Naruto was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> who could <em>never</em> have gotten the password correct on his first try (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">this being Sasuke's plan with the password all along</a>). Sure enough, when the real Naruto appears, the first thing he says is asking for Sasuke to repeat the password.
</li><li> In a filler arc, Naruto, Kiba and Hinata invoke this trope to distinguish themselves from their impostors. They have Hinata, who injured her leg, stay behind, and have the real Kiba be identified by having Akamaru with him, and the real Naruto identified by the chest via carrying it like a backpack. Amusingly enough, at the end of the arc, Naruto sets down the chest for a moment and Hinata, noticing he doesn't have it with him, sends him flying with a palm strike.
</li><li> In another filler arc, the villains impersonate Hinata, but the fake Hinata doesn't blush when coming into contact with Naruto.
</li><li> In the Sasuke Retrieval arc, Shikamaru disguises himself as Jirobo and pretends to catch up with the rest of the Sound Ninja Four. When Tayuya scolds him for being late, he apologizes, but Kidomaru refuses to hand over the barrel containing Sasuke, saying that Jirobo would have scolded Tayuya for her bad language.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Szayelaporro makes clones of Uryu, Renji, Dondochakka and Pesche. Uryu and Renjis clones hair is slightly different and they have markings on their eyes. Dondochakkas clones have no spots on their backs. Pesches clones wear trousers rather than a loincloth. Szayelaporro claims that this is not carelessness as much as modifying them to fit his tastes, and while Renji claims he is stupid for doing this, Uryu notes that Renji didnt notice until he pointed it out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>, a minor antagonist tries to protect himself from Syaoran's attacks by claiming to have taken Sakura hostage. However Syaoran realises that the Sakura in front of him is just an illusion, since she calls him "Syaoran" instead of "Syaoran-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">kun</a>". They're not in first name basis anymore; their past together has been written out of her memories as per the deal he made with Yuuko.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a flashback episode where a grown up Shinichi is combating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief">Kaito Kid</a> (who can near perfectly disguise himself as anyone). Shinichi figures out which police officer Kaito was disguised as because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was the only one who remembered his own I.D. number. <em>No one remembers their I.D. number</em>.</span>
</li><li> A currently manga-only story (as the anime hasn't caught up to it yet) features the culprit being unmasked because A) he responds to a phrase that sounds like a person's name to someone who speaks standard Japanese like the Osakan Heiji and Kazuha (namely, recognizing it's a candy and telling the girls they shouldn't spoil their meals with sweets); and B) when given oversalted ramen, echoes Heiji and Kazuha's sentiments that it's "overspiced" (Osaka-ben speakers only really use the word "salty" to describe salt water and in food, call salt a spice).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em>, Terryman attempted to masquerade as Kinnikuman to fight the Seven Devil Choujin while Kinnikuman recovered from his first bout with SteCasse King. He's quickly busted by being left-handed when Kinnikuman is right handed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarineBoy">Marine Boy</a></em>: A false Marine Boy calls the real one's Dad by a variation of "father" the real Marine Boy doesn't use and this clues Marine Boy's Dad to the fact someone is impersonating him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Semi-Perfect Cell tries to lure Android 18 to him by imitating Android 17's voice. He gives himself away when he praises Dr. Gero, unaware 17 and 18 despise the man.
</li><li> In a story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, the target of the hitman Black is revealed to be an alien and master of disguise named Karmelon, who was disguised as a boy. Not giving up, Karmelon turns into Nana, hoping to throw Black and Yami off. But Karmelon's transformation backfires, as he forgets to copy Nana's chest size, which angers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">Nana</a> into beating him to a pulp.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> series, the Black Moon send out a monster disguised as Chibi-Usa's mother to try tricking and capturing her. Chibi-Usa at first falls for it and almost runs into the impersonator's arms, but stopped herself and said that the impostor forgot one detail: she called Chibi-Usa "Rabbit", aka the Black Moon's name for her. Her mom Queen Serenity refers to Chibi-Usa as "Small Lady" instead. In the dub, where the villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">are the ones who call her Small Lady</a>, the inverse is the result
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a> has shapeshifter Zennet using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyImpersonation">Easy Impersonation</a> skills to transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">Julie</a>.

</li><li> During the "Six Days Later" portion of the Mahora Festival arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, the daughter of one of the teachers at Mahora Academy tries to hinder the attempt by Negi's students to save him by, among other tricks, creating an illusion of Takahata to confront Asuna and Yue. However, Yue is able to deduce that this is not the real Takahata by the fact that he referred to her as "Ayase-san", whereas the real one, thanks to his experience of being the one responsible for the remedial sessions with the Baka Rangers before Negi arrived, would have referred to her on a given name basis.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> mini-series <em>Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives!</em>, Peter and Mary Jane are conversing about Ned Leeds, the man they all thought was the original Hobgoblin. However, as they were doing so, Peter realizes something he should have had ages ago: if Ned Leeds was the real Hobgoblin, the assassins that came in and killed him would have been the ones dead because he would have had the Goblin Formula in him. That leads to everyone realizing they'd been had. Among other powers, uses of the Goblin Formura get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and have recovered from seemingly deadly injuries.
</li><li> In a 1990s storyline, Peter Parker's parents, Richard and Mary, appeared to have returned years after being believed dead. All evidence indicated they'd been held prisoner in Russia and were accepted by everyone. Richard suggested they all go out to a dinner to celebrate the anniversary of May's wedding to Richard's brother, Ben. May instantly knew something was wrong because while she and Ben had a public wedding on that date, they actually had gotten married first in secret a month before...and Richard and Mary had been there. This was the first clue for Peter to discover his "parents' were androids created by the Chameleon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> comic book story "The Fake Smurf", Gargamel (and Hogatha in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>) was capable of creating a formula that can change him into the form of a Smurf...but one detail that was missing in the transformation was that his impersonation doesn't have a tail. Gargamel tries to correct this by gluing a fake tail onto his behind, but later on the tail ended up falling off, and Gargamel was soon spotted and revealed to be the fake Smurf.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan">The Superior Foes of Spider-Man</a></em>, Boomerang figures out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">the gangster Hammerhead</a> menacing him is actually a disguised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Chameleon</a>, because Chameleon!Hammerhead was talking in a stereotypical gangster accent, and while that is Hammerhead's signature trait, the real Hammerhead had actually dropped the quirk at that point.
</li><li> This is what pings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> into realizing the Cyborg Superman isn't the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in the "Reign Of The Supermen" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a></em> - he casually mentions to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">Superboy</a> that he wished he had better control of his powers when he was his age.

In 1984, the Thing's long-time love interest Alicia Masters started undergoing some changes in characterization. She soon switched allegiances from the Thing to the Human Torch, and she married Johnny Storm in 1987. In 1991, it was revealed that this "Alicia" was Lyja, a female Skrull agent. She was good enough in impersonating Alicia that none of the Fantastic Four, their allies, and most of their enemies figured out the differences. Except for the super-villain Puppet Master, who happens to be Alicia's stepfather/adoptive father and raised the girl from childhood. He could tell that his "daughter" was acting out of character and started investigating why. Forgetting that the woman she was impersonating had a parent who knew her better than anyone else, Lyja undermined a pretty good espionage scheme.
<ul><li> A key moment in the above is when the Puppet Master visits the grave of Alicia's mother to find it's covered with grass, vines and dead flowers. This indicates Alicia hasn't visited the grave in a long time which was the first true clue to the Puppet Master something was wrong as Alicia never went a week without going there.
</li><li> Puppet Master tricks the New Warriors into attacking the FF as a distraction so he can talk to Alicia. Truly blind as part of the disguise, Lyja reacts as if to a complete stranger which confuses Puppet Master. When the Torch arrives and identifies him, Lyja realizes her mistake as the real Alicia would instantly recognize her stepfather's voice.

The sheriff realizes it's a fake when he notices that they're wearing their seatbelts in the illusion - when <em>not</em> wearing them was what killed them in the first place.

Geordi knows that Data is too precise to forget the transmission or decide not to bother with it, so when he notices the discrepency a few days after the incident, it's the first hint that something's a little bit off about the whole thing.

<ul><li> For a period of time in between major updates, Spies suffered from one glaring flaw in their disguises- lack of unlockable weaponry. A Spy's disguise would always show the stock loadout for the class, even as reskins and alternate weapons became widely available and popular, so if you had one player on your team without unlockables, you could be almost certain that they were a spy. This was later patched out, and now Spies imitate the chosen weaponry of their disguise target.
</li><li> Another common sign of a poor spy is always having their primary out no matter the context. For example, real Medics will almost always have their medigun out for emergency healing, so a Medic with a syringe gun out is very suspicious.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0u7kd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0u7kd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0u7kd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This switch can be made by changing to your secondary and pressing "B".</span>

The meter now shows properly, but permanently shows 0% for disguised Spies, which is only marginally less suspicious - every half-decent Medic outside of spawn has some charge built up.

</li><li> During World War 2, the forces of the Ustasha regime in Croatia were able to detect young Serbs (who belong to the Orthodox church) by telling them to make the sign of the cross. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ne7p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ne7p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ne7p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most Orthodox Christians cross themselves right to left, Catholics (like the Ustasha) cross themselves left to right.</span>
</li><li> During the Battle of the Bulge, Germans in U.S. uniforms infiltrated the allied lines. One of the quick ways to check out an unknown soldier was to ask him to say "squirrel".
</li><li> A similar test to spot Japanese saboteurs without coming close enough for a gander of their face was ordering them to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage">"Lollapalooza"</a>.
</li><li> One famous test for German spies infiltrating American camps during World War Two was asking the name of Mickey Mouse's girlfriend (Minnie, of course!).
</li><li> Another WWII example provided a surprise inversion of the trope. Americans testing for infiltrator would say the phrase "The terror of flight"; anyone who responded "The gloom of the grave" was immediately outed as a spy. Why? Those lines come from the third verse of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the national anthem of the United States. American higher-up realized that German spies would practice their false identities by memorizing the entire anthem...an example of <em>over</em>-preparing, as very few Americans would know the whole song by heart (many Americans don't even realize that "The Star-Spangled Banner" has multiple verses to being with). So in this case, the impostors <em>remembered</em> too many details.
</li></ul></li><li> During World War 2, any attempt of the Germans to pass forged documents to the Soviets ended up been exposed. The fakes were recognized even by ordinary soldiers. Only after a long time it became a well-known secret. Paper clips in the Soviet Union were made of ordinary steel (and in war they were rusty), and German paper clips (including the forgery of Soviet documents) used stainless steel.
