<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> have an unfortunate habit of sending players after these sorts of bad guys, especially for Raid encounters. Especially painful when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">pausing hurts the team</a>.
<ul><li> The all-time god-king of this trope is Pandemonium Warden of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>. Absolute Virtue may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">practically invincible</a>, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3169336">18 hours, and the Warden still isn't dead?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Makes one wonder if the developers like leather and pain. Square Enix has changed things in response to the bad press about Pandemonium Warden so that both it and Absolute Virtue are weakened and will vanish after two hours of fighting. However, while the new PW isn't unreasonable to beat within the alloted time, AV remains unbeaten without cheating. SE seems to be fond of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>, except without the "guide" part.
<ul><li> Square-Enix seemed determined to make the guy literally unbeatable for a long while. Every time a group managed to defeat him, often through "creative" use of mechanics, SE claimed that the method they used was "improper" and then patched him to cover that weakness. Even a strategy that Square-Enix <em>themselves</em> used to beat him, and subsequently <em>published in a video</em>, was later patched.
</li><li> Since then, the the game's level cap has been increased from 75 to 99, making it possible for players to achieve victory against Absolute Virtue by means of sheer brute force, though defeating it is still considered to be a monumental achievement by most.
</li></ul></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> generally avoids this outside of the highest-end content the game has to offer where this is to be expected but Patch 5.1 introduced Hades' Elegy, the Extreme version of the final boss for the main story of the expansion. The entire fight is a grueling four phase struggle that could take upwards of 15 minutes to conquer even when done <em>cleanly</em>. Battles that long was until then unheard of at this particular tier of difficulty and was generally reserved for Savage tier difficulty. Fortunately the dev team knew just how long the fight was and when cleares mercifully grants two of the tokens for clearing as opposed to just one. This does not change the fact that the fight is incredibly long for a tier of content that often has complete strangers coming together to clear it as opposed to an organized raid static.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em> mostly avoids this, but the old version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Hamidon</a> could take three hours even with a large raid and smart players. After Hamidon got a rework, people had gotten him down in 15 minutes.
<ul><li> The last mission of the Imperious Task Force can go this way, with the Nictus-infused Romulus having three 'pet' Nictus Essences that deliver additional damage, one of whom also has an area-of-effect heal (on top of Romulus' own impressive healing rate) whose effect increases for each player character within a fairly long radius, often making this fight a protracted and painful process.
</li><li> Reichsman from the Dr. Khan Task Force didn't take as long as Romulus but it was close. He didn't have any particularly special powers but he had a lot of hit points (about 10x the normal for an Archvillain of his level) and since regeneration scaled with hit point total out-damaging his regeneration required pretty good damage. Of course having a character with a strong regeneration debuff along made the fight a lot easier but a lower damage team without any regeneration debuffs was in for a major grind.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. Early Molten Core raids regularly spent an hour or so on the earlier bosses.
<ul><li> Kael'Thas Sunstrider from Tempest Keep is an excellent example from <em>Burning Crusade</em>. In his first phase, he sends his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">four minions</a> at you one at a time. Then you fight magical moving weaponry for phase two. When those go down you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">you fight all four of the minions at once after he... had a soulstone on them or something.</a> Phase four he finally attacks you. In phase five, he adds a couple neat tricks. He also talks for about ten minutes at the start, each of the mini bosses have their own line when they attack/die and there's a speech between every phase. Plus, after this there's Magister's Terrace because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">empowered by a demon lord.</a> This weakened him into a five man where he continued to talk you to death. People literally lost the fight because they stopped paying attention during his speeches only to find out the fight had started.
</li><li> General Rajaxx and co in Ahn'Qiraj will send waves of his mooks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> before you fight him.
</li><li> Every boss except Archimonde in Mount Hyjal, because you needed to kill eight waves of mooks before the boss even showed up. Fighting Illidan in Black Temple also takes around 15 minutes, when other bosses in the Black Temple take around three minutes each.
</li><li> There's also Deathwing, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Cataclysm on heroic. You first have to actually <em>get</em> to him while his Mooks, which include a boss battle fight you on the way there, which may or may not count, then you fight him. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">two individual boss battles</a>. First you have to kill all but 2 of the tentacles on his back, which start at 4, then get him to flip over, killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> that spawn, <em>then</em> you kill the last tentacle, kite the mook around killing lesser mooks while whittling it's hp to 10% or so while pulling him over all the dead lesser mooks, to make him unstable, exploding and revealing the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">weak point</a> which is then attacked, it takes 2 tries to kill, so <em>now</em> you take out his final tentacle and repeat the explosion part all over again. If you done all that, Congratulations! There are now <em>six</em> tentacles and you have to repeat it again, then one last time with <em>eight</em>. After that's all done, you have beaten the first boss battle with him. The second involves killing a large tentacle so it doesn't use it's Impale twice which deals Massive Damage, then killing his arm, which is clinging to the platform, which spawns waves of mooks that deal escalating damage once <em>again</em> forcing you to kill <em>them</em>, all while deathwing occasionally blasts you with a big rock that deals a chunk of damage, then constantly deals damage, forcing you to kill <em>that</em>. If you don't do all of this in short enough time, he finishes casting "Final Cataclysm" causing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a>. Done? Good! You lose one of the 4 buffs and have to do it <em>3 more times</em>. <em>THEN</em> comes the final bit, where he spawns unending waves of mooks, and does damage to everyone based on how much hp he is missing.
</li></ul></li><li> Blizzard has gotten much better about this over time, to the point where most boss battles even in raids are <em>supposed</em> to finish in under 10 minutes, and if the players take longer, the Boss goes berserk and kills the raid in seconds. However, there are exceptions:
<ul><li> Encounters where you have to fight off a lot of mooks before the Boss even joins the fight (although the actual boss battle tends to be pretty short).
</li><li> Final bosses in the longer raids are usually given longer, multi-phase fights, especially when its the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the expansion like Deathwing as shown above.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> has more than its share of Marathon Bosses, although some of them, such as the Sleeper, probably weren't supposed to be killed. Kerafyrm, AKA "The Sleeper" was intentionally designed to be unkillable. What is suppose to happen when you wake him up is that he goes on a rampage through various zones on the continent, getting his revenge against dragon-kind for putting him to sleep in the first place, and then disappearing forever. A ONE-TIME ONLY event for the <em>entire server</em>. After it happens, that's it, it will never happen again. The top three most powerful guilds on the Rallos Zek server took this as a challenge. Using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> tactics to keep Kerafyrm distracted was the only way they could fight him, because he hit far too hard to properly tank him. On top of this, he was completely immune to all spell attacks except for the Shadowknight's Harm Touch and the Wizard's Manaburn, both which can only be used once every 90 minutes, and could only take hold once every minute on Kerafyrm himself. Nearly 300 players took roughly 3 hours to finally whittle him down to zero. His corpse had no loot.
</li><li> The difference between the real bosses and the smaller "Area Bosses" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> is that the real bosses take upwards of two hours to kill <em>with a full party of overleveled characters</em> while the Area Bosses go down in less than two or three minutes if they don't kill you first. To put it bluntly, the most recent raid bosses have <em>trillions</em> of HP. Even after Nexon removed the damage cap, entire parties consisting of players hitting for several hundred million damage multiple times a second still take anywhere between ten and twenty minutes to beat them, assuming they aren't taken out by the veritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> scenarios they're forced to dodge.
</li><li> This is a built in mechanic for the Player Owned Stations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>. They have so many hitpoints that they require dedicated ships whose sole purpose is to function as siege tanks against them, and it still takes hours or days with multiple units just to collapse their shields. This was to allow the owners of the station time to mount a counterattack before the station could be taken down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> has several world bosses with 15-30 minute timers before the event fails, while failure to kill them before that will typically yield little or no reward.
<ul><li> The Claw of Jormag fight typically has six stages where it is impossible to directly damage the boss, forcing the players to instead deal with hordes of adds, protect friendly NPCs, and tear down ice structures. These stages can easily last several minutes each, while the boss itself can be damaged for less than a minute at a time between them. The total allowed time for the fight is 30 minutes.
</li><li> Tequatl's battle has the boss depart the arena every 25% of his health bar, stopping the timer while another event plays out. If successful, Tequatl takes damage and the standard fight resumes. The boss encounter has a maximum length of 15 minutes, but the events raise it to a possible 21 minutes for a full-length fight.
</li><li> The Prime Hologram during the Battle of Lion's Arch was a three-stage fight with a maximum time limit of 25 minutes. Successful fights typically ran 20 to 22 minutes. Unlike other bosses where downed players could run back, the Hologram arena could not be entered after the battle started, requiring those inside to resurrect others as well.

<ul><li> Absolute Defense has the Crazed Tank Cat, who has 3,200,000 health and the range and attack power to back it up. Making matters worse are the mooks that support the boss, most notably Duches; who can tank one Bahamut Cat attack and Owlbrows; who have decent range and attack to plow the way for the Crazed Tank to wreck havoc on your army.

Most bosses in this game go down in 30 seconds to a minute in an average run.

If so, be prepared to spend about 15-20 minutes unloading all of your weapons into its weakpoint while being flung back by its shockwave and laser attacks. Oh, and if you die, its health fully regenerates. Ditto General Knoxx on Playthough 2.5. Not only can he easily kill in a single attack if you are not being careful, but he has Devastators in both Normal and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Badass</a> forms, as well as Lance Medics who can heal about 5 minutes' worth of damage in 10 SECONDS.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo">BNK3R (pronounced "Bunker")</a>, a giant, flying robot with a monumental amount of health. There is an ammo-vending machine located near the area where Bunker is fought, and you will need it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, Zero (the character) players who invest in B0re can make laughably short work of it due to its multitude of aligned critical hit points, where one well placed shot can reduce its health to 1 in seconds, but it won't die because it needs to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">second form where it deploys its cannon</a> and align itself to deploy the loot before you can kill it. This exploit can get to the extent where the game may suffer performance issues trying to process the amount of critical hits being scored in such a short time.</span>
</li><li> There's also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Warrior, the game's final boss, which resembles a giant angry demon-dog with fire breath. This time, you can't run back and forth to a vending machine.</span>
</li><li> The raid bosses. If you thought <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Warrior</span> was hard, think about a monster specifically designed to be taken on by a team. Extremely powerful attacks and a crap ton of health  if its name ends with "the Invincible" and you're alone, <strong>run</strong>.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>-worthy raid boss in particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Dexiduous The Invincible</a>, has over 13-and-a-half <strong>Billion</strong> health, by far the most of any enemy in the game. While this sounds ridiculous, do note that at that point character builds worth even half their salt will be dealing damage ranging from the hundred-thousands to the millions per shot.
</li><li> The mini-DLC <em>The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler</em> has an ingenious parody. The Wattle Gobbler itself is a fairly mild boss, but afterwards quest-giver Mr. Torgue has one more thing for you: Say hi to his grandmother. Fitting the Thanksgiving theme, you are given two "missions" to patiently and politely listen to Grandma Flexington's stories. You can't walk away, and you have to give the right answers when she checks that you're paying attention. The second, "Raid Difficulty", is a full twenty minutes of doing <em>nothing</em> but listen (except for a brief fetch quest in the middle just to keep you on your toes).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shadow Trap</span>, the final boss in the Claptastic Voyage DLC. He has an ungodly amount of health and it takes a ridiculously long time just to get rid of his shields, it can easily take anywhere from 30-45 minutes to defeat him in your first playthrough, and potentially over an hour in True Vault Hunter Mode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm">BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm</a></em>, the final battle with Arianna can last for quite a while. Her four phases put together have a whopping total of 750,000 HP. To put things in perspective, most of the other endgame bosses have about 100,000. The only enemy with more health is Esoteraphim, a nigh-impossible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> boss that wasnt even put in the game until several months after release. For his part, Esoteraphim has 790,000 HP, but youll barely ever get to attack him, since he enforces a frantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingLoop">Healing Loop</a> by automatically K.O.ing one of your characters every other turn (in addition to his regular attacks), meaning the fight can last for literally hours with very little progress being made. (And for extra fun, when his health finally hits 50%, he gains the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">heal</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveDungeon">Brave Dungeon</a>'s bosses have high Hp, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zizou</span>, the game's secret boss takes the cake and eats it with her whopping 3500000 Hp.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyr/Myria</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BreathOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BreathOfFire">Breath of Fire</a></em>. Then again, you should have known after the previous bosses that after the health bar you actually <em>see</em> is only a <em>fraction</em> of their <em>actual</em> health.
</li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchThreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchThreeGame">Match-Three Game</a> example, too. Normally when clearing the top of the screen in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleWitchSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleWitchSaga">Bubble Witch Saga</a></em>, you're given a congratulatory message, but the first time you do so on level 166, you get the message, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Lord of Shadows</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">is gathering his strength...</a>" and are taken to another screen. It turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">three-stage level</a>, at the end of which one of his <em>five</em> heads explodes, meaning four more three-stage levels before he's defeated.
</li><li> The final boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildOfEden">Child of Eden</a></em> has about five forms and can take over 10 minutes to complete; witness it in all its glory <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDdVD7K1Y9U">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord Burroughs</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower3">Clock Tower 3</a></em>. First of all, he has two health bars while the other bosses only have one. Each health bar takes twice the damage of a normal boss. He has two main attacks; a tether ball projectile similar to yours, and a pool of red slime that traps the player for a few seconds, leaving them open to projectiles. He does have a sword, though he only uses it at close range. What makes this boss a pain in the ass is that when he tethers you with three balls, he does an instant-kill attack. These can be dodged by crouching, but using this strategy drags on the fight for more than half an hour.
</li><li> Hot Limit and other "long version" songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a>: 5th Mix</em>.

Not only clocking in at seven minutes (while the average DDR song is under two,) it also has in the neighborhood of 2000 steps, meaning you can get multiple 300+ combos in a single song (where as 300 is about typical for one song on the highest DDR difficulty.) Granted, you have to find and download the song for yourself to run in Stepmania, but some of us go out of our way to run (nearly literal) marathons.
</li><li> Special mention goes the Challenge courses in the US release of DDRMAX. In most games, this mode makes you do 4 songs in a row without stopping and little room for error. This game, on the other hand, makes you do 24 songs in a row without missing more than 3 steps total. On top of that, they're HARD songs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> 2: Chaos Rising</em>:
<ul><li> The final boss has 3 million HP and can regenerate about 200 000 at a time. Your units can deal 1000-2000 damage at best. Kind of justified, since he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Greater Daemon of Nurgle</a>, and those are said to be able to destroy whole planets alone.
</li><li> Also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Avatar</a> in the base game, who requires thirty or forty minutes of beating on and running away to take down because he'll kill your entire force if you just sit around hitting him.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen">The Denpa Men</a></em>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">basically three boss fights</a> against the Rook, Queen and King without being allowed to heal or change equipment. While the Rook can be basically beat by barraging it with physical attacks, the Queen can use a guard shield to defend itself, and uses some more damaging attacks. They're both easy compared to the King. He has tons of HP and regains some HP at the end of every turn, he attacks twice in one turn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">he can easily sweep your entire party</a>, he can use guard shields to completely neutralize damage, he flip-flops from being completely invulnerable to magic and being invulnerable to physical attacks (while still being fairly strong against magic), and, near the end of the fight, he flat-out <em>becomes invincible</em> for a few turns, and there's nothing to do but wait it out. Yikes. The whole sequence of fights can go on for nearly an hour if you're unlucky. They even make their return in the sequels as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">post-game bosses</a> and are just as hard. The third game even has you fight all three of them at once.
<ul><li> The Denpa Men: Beyond the Waves's final boss isn't any easier. Thought the Evil Witch has no other forms, she hits hard with several different elements. This will take you some time if you're prepared and even more so if you're not using equipment to strike at her various weaknesses. Her second fight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell">the Inferno</a> (as Demon Queen) is the same and is only made slightly shorter because all her phases are also weak to Light.
</li><li> The Denpa Men: Rise of Digitoll's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Master Squelch</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Self Made King</a> is one of these by virtue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">his high HP count</a>, hard hitting attacks and having Master Squelch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">transform into</a> Self Made King (aka King of Evil) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">halfway through the fight.</a> Even if you can strike him down with Light, he'll take a bit to go down.

In fact, if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">don't apply a patch</a>, the final boss is actually <em>invincible</em> on all but the two easiest difficulty levels, making the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. Said patch also makes the level 7 boss die much more quickly.

<ul><li> Belberith is pretty nasty, forcing you to walk all over the map before you can hurt him (unless you can fly or warp across gaps in the stages), all the while attacking you and summoning enemies. And when you finally get in range to hurt him he has tonnes of HP, nasty resistances, and regeneration.
</li><li> And he <em>pales</em> in comparison to Babel, the final boss. If you're playing Amane or Naoya's path it <em>merely</em> involves taking down a boss while enemies are spawning, <em>taking out all of the Bels, including Belberith</em>, and then killing the supremely nasty Babel. If you're on Gin or Atsuro's path it's longer and even nastier (though not including the Bels). Especially Atsuro's.
<ul><li> On Gin's path, you lose your demons, ALL of your demons, before going up against Babel's final form. This is annoying on your first playthrough, but your characters would probably be roughly on par with your demons so it wouldn't be THAT bad if you prepared for it. However, if you're not aware of how the fight works and are on your third or fourth playthrough, during which you probably completely relied on the end-game demons you carried over from each game, it's a good chance you'll lose due to being underleveled. Now, while the story hints at this, it's easy to assume you'd lose your demons AFTER Babel dies. Nope.

A five-phase long fight that lasts about 15 minutes and has no checkpoints. The precise timing required to beat his final phase means that it's very likely to lose right at the end and have to start all over again.
</li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">the .hack// games</a></em> try to emulate an MMO, they had to include a couple of these bosses. For instance: most of the Phases, in particular Macha, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Corbenik</a> (both from Volume 4), and Skeith (from Volume 1), the last of which is the hardest boss in the <em>series</em>, and especially the final Cubia fight, in which you fight your way through three of his "Cores", with each having more health than the last. Then you get to fight Cubia proper... and he fully regenerates his health once you kill him. So you get to kill him <em>again</em>... and then he regenerates <em>again</em>, at which point the plot takes over and he's killed in a different way.
</li><li> Bosses in the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonII">Double Dragon II</a></em> are in general much tougher than the first game, but Abore, the Andre The Giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ersatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ersatz">ersatz</a> in Mission 2 , takes the cake. It doesn't help that you fight two of him in the final stage.
</li><li> The Arishok in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> has an extra long health bar, high defense, and also uses health potions. On top of that, his swings are very hard hitting, enough to knock you down each time unless you have high fortitude or are immune to knockdown. And he can get you into an infinite knockdown chain, meaning you're potentially done if he hits you even once. He's way easier if you opt to face him along with his goons, because at least then you have a party helping you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Gokuu Gekitouden</em> has Freeza as this, of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">series of somewhat smaller fights</a> variety. His first form has 200,000 life, and each form after that has even more. The basic outline of the fight is: You fight Freeza's first form (200,000 life) using Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta. Then when you beat him he transforms into his second form, which has 300,000 life and you continue to fight him until Piccolo shows up. Then Piccolo goes one-on-one with Freeza's second form and when Freeza loses again he transforms into his third form, which has 350,000 life. Once Freeza has transformed into his third form Vegeta, Gohan and Krillin join in to help Piccolo, and once Freeza loses AGAIN he transforms into his final form, which has 400,000 life, and you fight him until Goku arrives. Then Goku goes one-on-one with final form Freeza and drops a Spirit Bomb on him when you win. And then, if you meet the requirements for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">True Ending</a>, Goku goes Super Saiyan and fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">100% Final Form Freeza</a>. Twice. This whole sequence of bossfights takes no less than three hours. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">you can't pause during battle</a>. Fortunately the game is generous enough to allow you to save in the middle of this series of bossfights, once when Piccolo arrives and again when Goku arrives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> where before you could even <em>attack</em>, you had to use a special item <em>seven times</em> by all four party members. Moreover, you're being attacked the whole time, and have to heal every other turn. <em>Then</em> comes the absurdly large health meter — and this boss has a habit of healing himself regularly, stretching it out even further.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em> does this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Necrosaro/Psaro the Manslayer/Death Psaro</span> refuses to die. He will transform six times for a whopping seven forms. His fourth form, the one where he finally gets serious, has the most HP and he constantly spams a healing technique. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em>'s final fight can be boiled down to whether he runs out of HP before your healers run out of MP. And in the original NES version, where you're stuck with AI control for everyone except the main character, luck is an even bigger factor than usual for boss fights. As in, "will I luck out and have my healers actually heal when I need them to?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemManhattanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemManhattanProject">Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project</a></em> has pretty normal boss fights, with one exception: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, Wozma. It's an immobile green sphere with about ten times as much health as any other boss in the game and takes a good 15-30 minutes of jumping up and firing rockets at it to kill it. It's pretty well-hidden, requiring you to find all the nukes on Hard difficulty and then take a special path that's only unlocked after you've got them all. Unfortunately, your only reward for beating it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">an icon on your saved game</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII">Dungeon Siege II</a></em> has a number of these bosses: with the black mage battles, you must destroy 3 crystal prisms that form an impenetrable shield around the boss before you can do any damage; you are then allowed to take away about a sixteenth of their health before the crystal prisms return.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em>:
<ul><li> The ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of each game certainly qualifies, sporting sky-high HP that dwarfs nearly everything else before them and deadly attacks that can level the party if not defended against. That of <em>The Fafnir Knight</em> has <strong>140,000 HP</strong>, paired with a self-healing ability on top of flunkies that have 10,000 each. The ultimate DLC boss of the same game has a record-breaking <strong>280,000</strong>.
</li><li> The Golem in <em>The Millennium Girl</em> is surprisingly tough due to its associated quest becoming available while you're about 10 levels too low to match it. When its HP is depleted, it gets back up at half health, putting the player in for a longer fight than they bargained for.
</li><li> While a lot of bosses suffer from HP bloat in <em>The Fafnir Knight</em>, the three elemental Dragons get particularly nasty about it. The main issue is that they also summon a core that casts an elemental attack that grows stronger for every turn the core is alive, so you can't just ignore it or it will become too strong to handle. The cores have a non-trivial amount of HP, so you're going to need to take time off the main body to fight it, and the dragon can regenerate it periodically during the fight. All this, while the dragon continues to harass you with deadly attacks. The Great Dragon is the worst of them all, sporting <strong>72,000</strong> HP and a core with <strong>13,000</strong>, on top of sky-high Strength that can one-shot your more fragile party members. You have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> to help you out, but she's so poorly optimized she might as well be a meat shield.
</li><li> Other bosses in other entries can qualify if the player simply walks up and challenges them, as they will be sporting a full HP bar which is often too large for the party's resources to handle. This will mandate walking around the floor or boss room to trigger certain map events that will weaken it to manageable levels, going from this trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>.

She's a raid boss designed for the entire playerbase to fight at once, each player reducing her total HP by one to six million per battle. Even with that, it takes several days for the players to reduce her health completely... and she keeps coming back six times, so the whole event battle lasts about two weeks in real time.

To put that in perspective, the second most durable boss only has a little over 5000. Plus, Chaos can cast Curaja to heal himself for 9999 HP whenever he feels like it.
</li><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, if you played the game normally (i.e not maxing out evasion, wearing armor, and not getting the Blood Sword). To put things in perspective, a party that has done an average amount of grinding will do about 300 damage per attack on the final boss, who has 15,000 HP and constantly heals itself for roughly 5,000 HP every time he uses a physical attacks. Players who didn't utilize a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> at some point will probably spend about four hours fighting the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> doesn't have a true marathon boss, per se, but it has a tactic that turns any boss into a marathon boss: Quickleak. Basically, you first have a Time Mage cast Quick, and then have them perform a Bio-based spell or attack to induce Sap status, including breaking a Bio Rod. However, you then DON'T use your other Quick turn, and wait. As ARavingLoon explained <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x7zRK-Fsv8">in this helpful video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Quick stops the in-game timer. Because Sap is linked to the timer, it will continue to run indefinitely as long as you're still in Quick until the enemy you use it on perishes. Moreover, being in Quick means the enemy can't attack you. Because Sap is a joke status (it only hits for 7.5 dps), every enemy, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> Shinryuu and Omega, are susceptible to it. <em>However,</em> because Sap hits for so little damage, late-game bosses, with their HP in the five digits, take a couple hours at minimum to defeat. Because you have to cast it for each part, Neo-Exdeath takes <strong>eight hours</strong>. And in all of this, you can't do anything in-game. So you can either sit around and wait...or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryzaT1s8alI">play a game of golf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

The Kaiser Dragon has 327,500 HP, and can easily take 20 minutes to kill. And once you've beaten him, you unlock the Soul Shrine, which involves fighting every boss from the bonus dungeon in a row, ending with Kaiser Dragon again (though by the point you're taking on the Soul Shrine, you're usually powerful enough to kill everybody quickly).

There are two abilities that can break the standard cap of 9999 damage, and both are fairly hard to get, so you'll probably be damaging at or below that cap with every attack. The "Regen" spell heals you by a small amount every once in a while, apparently a set fraction of your maximum health. When you cast Regen on yourself with a maximum health of 9999 HP, that being another cap, the healing is still in the double digits. If Ultimecia's second form casts Regen, it'll heal itself in the high quadruple digits. Ultimecia has four forms and, by her fourth, it gets even worse as she can "blow" away junctions. If the battle ends up taking too long, you'll end up with minuscule stats and hp because the final boss took away all your junctions, and if this happens, you <em>will</em> lose and have to lose the past hour's worth of work.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Trema, who has 999999 HP, which is insane considering his defense. Funnily, he still goes down easier than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Paragon</a> that <em>he killed in the pre-fight cutscene</em>.
</li><li> Angra Mainyu, located in the desert. Three targets and the main one has 333400 HP. Less than the above Trema, but a ton for a fight that is not located in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. The two arm targets are easy to defeat, though the main target likes to heal them with Full Life a lot; and if all three of them are active on the field, they can use an attack that can easily spell death for your party. Even with using the 'easiest' strategy of having two strong Dark Knights for attacking all three targets at once and an Alchemist for easy healing, this fight can still take close to 30 minutes, if not more.

<ul><li> Yiazmat, the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> shown in the picture above, regularly takes players as much as 12 hours to kill, thanks to its astronomical 50 million HP. The real kicker? Near the end of the fight, Yiazmat pulls off a little trick that, if not caught and stopped, <em><strong>heals him back to full health</strong></em>.
<ul><li> The Renew spell heals the target to <strong>full HP</strong>. Yes, it can be Reflected. Guess which spell you're likely using to restore HP, and guess what he casts on your entire party without warning when at low health. Other 'nice' tricks are his ability to stop the delay of his special moves, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKOs</a>, once he reaches a fifth of his health, and reducing the damage cap from 9999 to 6999 at half of his health. The minimum number of hits required is 6073.
</li><li> Each of his physical attacks also have a 5% chance of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKOs</a>. As he gets lower on health, his attack chains get longer (to a maximum of 12), with each of those hits retaining the 5% chance for Instant Death.
</li><li> If a character moves out of his physical reach, he'll start spamming Instant Death spells on them (100% accurate without the Shell buff on the target, 50% accurate with it).
</li><li> He can also use the "Growing Threat" skill to double his effective level.
</li><li> In the IZJS and Zodiac Age versions, the damage cap is removed from player characters, but they are still limited in damage when Yiazmat puts his paling up. That is, if he can... There is a complex strategy that manages to deal enough damage to down him in about 25-30 minutes, involving reflecting Darkga off the caster and onto Yiazmat for five figure damage 3 times a cast, while also preventing him from hitting you through unique placement of characters. Even cheesing the crap out of him takes almost half an hour, plus the time taken to get everything into position.
</li></ul></li><li> If you fight Zodiark as soon as you can (after beating Giruvegan, but before you can buy the spell Scathe), and aren't at a high enough level to slice off his last 50,000 or so HP before he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">puts up a Paling</a>, expect to spend at least half an hour taking off the last of his HP bit by bit with non-elemental magic spells such as Scourge or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Drain</a>.

The first two fights with him can easily take up to 20 minutes because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">ridiculously high HP</a>. He actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">goes down fast</a> in his final incarnation, but that's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">the beginning</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Vercingetorix</a>, who has 15.8 million HP (although it's worth noting that the default damage cap in that game is 99,999, not 9,999, and the fight will probably take no more than 15-20 minutes).
</li><li> Some of the oretoises. An Adamantoise has loads of HP and its resistances mean you only do 10% of normal damage (1% of normal with any elemental attack.), although those resistances can be lowered by attacking its legs, which renders it briefly helpless and vulnerable. The target time for killing one is around 30 minutes (although a high-level party can potentially win in 2-3). The good news is that they're susceptible to Death, so with a little luck or a lot of patience the fight can be very short. Long Gui (the more powerful version of Adamantoise), however, are not vulnerable to Death.

Garnet and Amber hang on to the side of the platform you're on and smack your party with powerful attacks, while Jet hovers a ways off and buffs Garnet and Amber. When you take down Garnet and Amber, who both have over 100,000 HP, Jet comes forth and challenges you. Jet has over a million HP, and gives you only a brief window of time to attack him before he revives Garnet and Amber, forcing you to take them down again. Also, after you start doing some serious damage to Jet, he starts using combination Flare attacks with Garnet and Amber, the strongest of which can easily wipe all but the most powerful of parties.

In the <em>Dissidia</em> combat system, the most damage that can be done at one time is 9999—but, given the way combat works, the player will only be able to pull off a 9999 damage hit rarely if at all against the boss, with hits in 500-1200HP damage range being far more likely. This, plus the fact that the player will be performing Bravery attacks in addition to HP attacks, plus the fact that the player is going to spend a loooot of time trying to avoid the boss's utterly devastating attacks, given that the player is likely to have only somewhere in the realm of 10K HP and basically has little-to-no healing... essentially, it adds up to a very long fight.

There are two ways to win the fight. The hard way is the fast way - destroy the main body, then destroy its arms, which requires being able to overcome the 500 thousand healing that the right arm can administer every round plus one character regularly dispelling the defensive buffs the right arm applies. The easier, slow way requires systematically destroying the arms in order so that they can't regenerate (10 times for the left, then 3 times for the right) before finally destroying the main body. Even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> making it so that it's easier to get powerful units to more easily pile on damage and defensive ones to cope with Aigaion's punishing attacks, the slow way still generally takes several hours to complete, and it was not unusual at launch to hear of players spending more than four hours and over 200 rounds of combat to finally win (with the fast way thought to be more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> than an actual strategy).

One such challenge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">God of War II</a></em> involves using General Kratos on the hardest difficulty with no upgrades to weapons or magic.

</li><li> The final bosses of both GBA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> games. The first game's final boss is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Boss</a> (and its first form being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Dual Boss</a>). Many of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a>: The Lost Age</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> also qualify, most notably the Star Magician. The Dullahan can be, because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> (unless you're massively overleveled) with attacks capable of screwing up your strategy.
<ul><li> Dullahan has more HP than the final boss, and if you play Hard Mode and randomly fight him in the Arena, he has the most HP any single monster can have. Alan Averill, formerly of Nintendo Power, said that most of the time he spent writing the part of the strategy guide for Dullahan was massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>. To quote him, "When Dullahan finally fell to my blade, I ran around screaming like a madman."
</li><li> For the first Golden Sun, there was Deadbeard, who was considerably harder than the final boss because of the fact that he resided in the biggest, hardest dungeon in the game.
</li><li> The final boss of <em>The Lost Age</em> actually has multiple forms/HP meters, though they're not shown. In addition to the obvious issues of this trope, every other boss in the game can easily be bum-rushed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>, and many players learn the hard way that trying to summon-rush the Doom Dragon only takes out the first, most harmless head, leaving them without defenses when the remaining heads start spamming Cruel Ruin and Djinn Storm.
</li></ul></li><li> A rare driving game example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo 5</a></em> takes the cake in sheer length. Endurance races are the last races you tend to earn in GT5, and they are all raced <em>in real time.</em> This includes the Nurburgring 24 Hours, which is exactly what it sounds like: the longest track in the game, in its longest configuration, raced for <em>a full day, alone.</em> It can only be accessed by reaching Level 40, the highest experience level in the game. The real-time idea was mercifully dropped in GT6.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundemoniumSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundemoniumSeries">Gundemonium Recollection</a></em>, Elixirel, has <em>11 forms</em>, one for each node on the Tree of the Sefirot. The good news is the 11th is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, so you only have to deal with 10 most of the time.

</li><li> The boss of the Rubina level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hydorah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hydorah">Hydorah</a></em> doesn't actually have much health, however there are two rotating rings of shields which make hitting it really difficult.

<ul><li> Unless you use the Wave, in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">you can defeat it in seconds</a>. Unfortunately, you can't get the Wave until much later in the game, so it doesn't help unless you deliberately skip Rubina and come back to it later.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the six bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em>, three could be easily said to be marathon bosses, especially on higher difficulty levels; worse still is the fact that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Bosses</a> who you're supposed to damage with either the arena or by reflecting one of their attacks, which serves to make the fights very repetitive. And any attempt to defeat the Sentinel -without- using the power fields (something you have to do if you want to get 100%), or Tor later on with Maximum Charge, <em>on Ultimortal</em>, will effectively take you upwards of ten minutes - and that's if you're lucky/skilled enough to beat them within that time frame. To put it into perspective, the <em>maker</em> of this game <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67eLpLhxEPg">takes more than seven minutes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to put the second one down!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:

In the GBA version, where most bosses have two, maybe three health bars, he has <em>four</em>. Not only that, but you can't actually damage him normally unless you go through his entire attack pattern. And when you do reach that point, you only have a few seconds since wind is blowing you off. Thankfully he's also open to attack every now and then, but it's unlikely you'll have strong enough cards to really exploit it until after you beat him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">The PS2 version</a> reduces his HP and gives you more openings for attack, but also adds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">second form</a> with more HP than the first, a sleight that does nothing but blow you away from the boss, and another that smacks all the cards out of your deck and forces you to run around and collect them.
</li><li> Ansem, the final boss for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory">Reverse/Rebirth</a> mode, is just as bad, if not worse, in the GBA version.

Like most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> in the series, he attacks almost constantly. On top of this he has 9 Health bars and excellent defense (Roughly 1800 HP and the most a player can ever do is 10-15 with maxed level and equipment). This amounts to 20-40 minutes of battling, monstrous compared to the 2-5 minutes typical of the series. No Heart takes so long because he is expected to be faced by multiple players at once, in a multiplayer battle, which would result in a more "reasonable" time to beat. When <em>Birth By Sleep Final Mix</em> was remade for the PS3 (as <em>2.5 HD Remix</em>), No Heart's HP and defense were heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> because multiplayer is no longer an option in the Playstation 3 version, resulting in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR0llMU8S4M&amp;list=UU7BSMVFWQZmSqZsWUQ63o3g">considerably shorter fight.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

He doesn't have much health, 200 compared to the 700 he has when you encounter the normal version at the end of the game, but has staggeringly high strength; 80 compared to his endgame normal version's 26, and extremely high defense; the Remnant has 27 defense compared to the normal endgame version's 15 defense. In addition to that, Vanitas Remnant has several devastating attacks that the normal version didn't have, including one that makes him totally invincible while he launches a series of devastating ranged attacks. But wait, there's more! He also takes 50 percent reduced damage from physical attacks, as well as 75 percent reduced damage from fire, ice and lightning attacks, and is immune to everything else, combine that will his already high defense, and you'll probably spend the entire fight hitting him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> unless you've done an obscene amount of level grinding. <em>Then</em>, if you take damage at any point in the fight, it will almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> you unless you have Second Chance and Once More equipped, due to his aforementioned staggeringly high attack, but you can't use the Cure/Cura/Curaga spell to heal yourself, or he will just use Cure/Cura/Curaga on himself instantly, healing him probably back to full health since he has so little health to begin with. So you're forced to use your limited amount of curative items, which will deplete over the course of the fight. The entire fight will probably consist of you dodging his attacks, getting in one or two scratch damage attacks, and then going right back on the defensive until he opens himself up again.
</li><li> The series' other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> are just as bad. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a>, we have the Ice Titan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Sephiroth</a>. The Ice Titan is a pain because the primary way to damage it is to deflect one of its attacks back at it, which as the fight goes on, it will do less and less, and often whilst you are in no position to be able to deflect. Sephiroth is easier to damage, but has a ridiculously large shield to whittle down before his health bar even begins to deplete, and has attacks which will almost kill you, even at full health. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a> has Sephiroth again, who has 15 health bars (the final boss has at most 7/8) and loves to do back-to-back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">Heartless Angels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Flashes</a> before you can heal.
</li><li> All games seem to end with ridiculously long bosses. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> has a final boss with at least 6 different parts to it; one part, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">The Giant Nobody Dragon</a></span>, is even split into 3/4 stages! <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has a similar number of parts to its final fight.

<ul><li> There's the fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xion</span>, which contains 4 stages, <em>and isn't even the final boss.</em> Although, despite being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the second-last boss</span>, it's more of a final boss than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the actual final boss, Riku</span>, who doesn't have multiple phases.

It requires you to defeat its tentacles before you even have a shot at the main body, which is only vulnerable for about twenty seconds before new tentacles spawn.
</li><li> Next is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateParrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateParrot">Ruler of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">the Sky</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">constantly tries to avoid you</a> and is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Boss</a> that requires you to destroy its tail segments first.
</li><li> The optional ones include the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder">Zip Slasher</a>, which is a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Invisible</a>, which is just as hard to hit as it is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">its original incarnation</a> but has a buttload more health, and finally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dustflier</a>, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a> that also has absurdly powerful attacks with (mostly) ridiculously wide ranges.

The Arenas are, by nature, about getting a good time, and the format of the Computer Virus battle seems to exist solely to slow you down. In Helper To Hero, some abilities are affected worse than others by it. Special mention goes to Knuckle Joe, who cannot deal enough damage in one go to defeat the Computer Virus with anything resembling quickness. Oftentimes, the Computer Virus battle can make up a solid 1/4 to 1/2 of a Knuckle Joe run.
</li><li> Dark Mind in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror">Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</a></em> is considered to be one of the longest final bosses in the series. Dark Mind's first form has to be fought 4 times, on different terrain. After that, you'll have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">fight his second form</a> followed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">by his final form.</a> At least you get to wail on him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits">during the credits.</a>
</li><li> Pyribbit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyTripleDeluxe">Kirby: Triple Deluxe</a></em>, as he starts to spend a lot of time in the background during the second phase and spends <em>very</em> little time vulnerable with he does show up to be hit. If you take a hit during that time (and you likely will, as every time he comes back to Kirby's platform, it's accompanied by an attack) and spend most of it stunned, the fight will only take longer. Made even worse in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dedede Tour</span>, where you not only have to fight Pyribbit EX, but you have to be quick about it, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot">Kirby: Planet Robobot</a></em> has the single longest boss fight in the series with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star Dream is a shoot-em-up fight that can take a good ten minutes to complete, having three forms, each with their own health bar. The True Arena exaggerates this even further with Star Dream Soul OS, which makes the first three forms stronger (with some new moves) and adds on one last form. It really does say quite a lot that a majority of this game's True Arena is fighting Star Dream Soul OS.</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies">Kirby Star Allies</a></em> takes it even further than Planet Robobot did with its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Void Termina</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As with the aforementioned Star Dream, he can take a good ten minutes to beat. He has a whopping four phases, two of which you fight on the Star Allies Sparkler and two of which you fight inside his innards, and both the first and third phases each have you shooting the eyes that pop up on his different body parts; destroying them causes massive damage to him, and once all five eyes are destroyed, he'll fall prone and you'll head into his innards to attack his heart as well as his essence. Luckily, his attacks are slow and simple enough that you should be able to take your time throughout the fight. Soul Melter throws in several differences in the form of some extra attacks and makes them slightly more difficult to dodge but still not too tough to do so, and Void Soul gains a few new attacks as well. His Soul Melter EX version isn't too different other than seriously ramping up the difficulty and making his attacks faster, and Void comes close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> with his new attacks and throws in several references to Dark Mind, Drawcia Soul and Zero with his new attacks as the fight draws closer to a close.</span>

If you haven't played it, magic is outrageously rare and is for use on bosses only. Only two characters have healing magic at all (Shana/Miranda and Meru), but Shana and Miranda are <em>so</em> much better at it than Meru and Boss battles with Shana and Miranda take <em>forever</em>, and the item limit is quite low. The way you heal is that every time you defend, you heal 10% of your maximum health. It definitely adds length to every boss fight. This isn't to say anything about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, which can easily take an <em>hour or two</em> if you're characters aren't grossly overlevelled.
</li><li> Tropicallo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana">Legend of Mana</a></em>: instead of taking damage like a regular boss, it loses a set fraction every time one of its two tendrils dies. One of them is an insanely tough attacking type tendril, the other casts magic and has a humongous self-destruct attack when detached. This gets turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Nightmare and No Future modes</a> — it does rather more damage, but is still a cakewalk. Unfortunately, while it winds up with a hundred health bars, the amount of damage dealt to it with each tendril's death <em>doesn't increase</em>, meaning that you will literally spend <em>hours</em> trying to put it out of its well-deserved misery. (Unless you turned off No Future mode before fighting it...)
</li><li> The Negativitron of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBIGPlanet 2</a></em>, who can only be hit at certain intervals of the fight, and all you can do is attempt to survive in between phases. Beating him can be very stressful as you get low on lives, but acing the fight (that is, beating him without a <em>single</em> death) is the real nightmare.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em>, if you want to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Gades during your first encounter with him</a> and have put in the required amount of level grinding to actually LET you do it, you're in for a good 20-30 minutes of battle.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Egg Dragon</a> of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns">Lufia: The Legend Returns</a></em> is intended to be this, hitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> of 65,535 HP. However, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">glitch</a> that lets the player humorously subvert this: chuck a Potion at it at the very beginning of the fight, watch its health overflow to a really small number, then hit it with an attack and watch it die. If you want to go at it the "real" way, though, you're in for a long haul.

On the easiest level, he has 100 life. On the hardest level, he has 400. To put this in context, in a standard game of <em>Magic</em>, players have 20 life, and in Shandalar, both you and the mooks tend to have lower life. But he uses a five-color deck with almost no mana fixing, so it's entirely possible that, even at 400 life, you're staring at just land on the other side of the table. Also, Shandalar's way more spell-friendly than most of the multiverse - it's not implausible that by the time you face Arzakon you have a deck that can do over 400 points of damage. In one round. Conceivably, <em>on the first round</em>.

Meanwhile, the second is timed and you have to use an almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>-y trick to beat it; fortunately, losing just causes you to go back to the beginning of the second boss. Another notable example is Chykka, which takes a particularly long time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld">Dark World</a> boss fights do have the light crystals, which slowly heal you, so they might have felt justified in that you have a theoretically infinite supply of health.
</li><li> Two bosses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> take a long if you don't know how to beat them: Mogenar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> Aurora Unit 313. If you try to use the wrong strategy against Mogenar, its regeneration will prolong the battle more and more. However, if you attack him the right way (and are quick), his regeneration won't even factor into it. Aurora Unit 313 is even worse because it's got four different attacks, and they all take a major chunk out of your remaining energy if they hit.
</li></ul></li><li> All of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame">Boss Game</a> so almost every mission is just a boss fight.
<ul><li> While the earlier large monsters can take 10-15 minutes, the end game bosses can take up to 45 minutes, and some of these are even with four hunters hitting it. Keep in mind that most fights have a time limit of 50 minutes so it's EXPECTED to take that long.
</li><li> The Elder Dragons, especially the the huge ones (i.e Ceadeus, Jhen Mohran, and Lao-Shan-Lung), have extreme HP and take at least 30 minutes or more. And most of the time they have a SMALLER TIME LIMIT than standard.
</li><li> Any monster that takes a long time to kill will just be a nightmare when you have to fight more than one at the same time. The only mercy applied is that they do have a slightly lower HP.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the later bosses in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> FPS <em>Moon</em> can take 192 bullets from your rifle (that being the maximum you can carry) and still be less than halfway to dead. Matters are exacerbated by the fact that sniper rifle ammunition is rare and the pistol's hard to use while dodging, so you'll be using your assault rifle for the rest of the fight, which damages bosses so little that only on the rare occasions they stop shooting at you temporarily will you be able to see their health bars going down as you pump them full of lead. Dying and retrying four or five times can lead to physical pain in one's left hand (that being the one in charge of holding down the L button to rapid-fire.)
</li><li> Bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> series usually have much more HP or higher defense than normal characters, and most are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Bosses</a> to boot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Henry</span>, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Bitter difficulty</a>, can take nearly a <em>thousand</em> hits before dying. You generally can do less than <em>ten</em> hits off a <em>dark step</em> (the timing for which is tighter in this fight than in any other in the game). Trying to exploit his normal openings will land you <em>maybe</em> three hits at a time, and a high chance of getting countered by something nasty.
</li><li> The normal final boss, Jeane, also takes a very long time to wear down, especially on Bitter difficulty.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler">Octopath Traveler</a></em>, accessed after completing all eight travelers' stories, a sidequest chain and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the dark god Galdera</span>, is a very long two-stage battle. The first stage pits you against a foe that has 500,000 HP (three times as much as the strongest optional bosses) and is guarded by three lesser enemies with 50,000 HP each and different weaknesses from each other, making it difficult to kill the three enemies simultaneously. In the second stage, the boss has less health, but is protected by three other targets with similar amounts of health, all of which must be killed in order to get a shot at the boss. To make matters worse, if you die on either stage of the boss, you must start at the beginning and do <em>all eight bosses</em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> all over again.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> battles during the Bandit Spider challenges in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> are this, since both the minibosses involved <em>and</em> the enemies have their HP significantly buffed. Among the regular bosses, there's Orochi and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yami</span> as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">"lots of smaller fights in a row"</a> variant. Unless you're insane enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">build everyone to Level 99</a>, in which case... fifteen minutes. Less if you have Armageddon.
</li><li> The battle against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortune and Strength</span> usually lasts about half an hour, though certain strategies, correct abilities and good timing on Fortune's Status Effect Roulette can end the fight in minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> has Shadow Mitsuo. At the very start of the fight, he creates a high-HP barrier around himself called "Mitsuo the Hero". Once you've defeated Mitsuo the Hero, you get to start hitting Shadow Mitsuo's health bar, which is not insignificant by any means. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">Shadow Mitsuo can also rebuild Mitsuo the Hero</a> - you can stop him if you do enough damage before he gets it up, but this isn't an easy feat. This resets Mitsuo the Hero's health bar, and you'll have to defeat it <em>all over again</em> before you can get back to wailing on Shadow Mitsuo himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, the final boss of the Cruise Ship palace <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy">The Conspiracy</a> against the Phantom Thieves, Masayoshi Shido</span> has <em>five</em> different phases, the first four of which serve to soften you up for his brutal final phase. To wit: he gets an extra turn for throwing party-wide damage from every element in the game at you, fishing for weaknesses in addition to doing everything the fourth phase does (a physical Fear-inducing attack and several debuffs); if he gets a knockdown, he'll follow it up with a One-Hit Kill attack, another Fear inducer, or Heat Riser to buff all his stats, all of which are really bad because he already hits like a truck on steroids. Your saving grace in the fight is that his rotation for the party-wide skills is predetermined, so having mass party-swap or Magic Barriers at the right times can lessen the sting, but if you lack both, the boss will get three guaranteed knockdowns over the course of the fight, which can snowball into a Game Over very quickly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Emperor Bulblax in the first game has a buffed life meter that takes much longer than any other creature to go down.
</li><li> If you're playing cautious with your Pikmin, the Titan Dweevil in the second game can go on for somewhere around 45 minutes. The reason is because all of its attached objects have to be disabled one by one, and each a high amount of hit points has to be inflicted. Even after you disable all the objects, you still have to kill the surprisingly bulky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel">Clipped-Wing Angel</a> form. This trope can also happen with some of the more powerful bosses, such as the Pileated Snagret and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Man-at-Legs</a>.
</li><li> The third game's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Plasm Wraith</span> continues the tradition of long-lasting final bosses. Before you even actually <em>fight</em> it, you're forced to go through the longest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> in the game. Once the actual fight begins, you'll very quickly discover that the boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">easily rivals the Titan Dweevil in regards of total health</a>. Be aware that the boss' health can actually <em>regenerate</em> if you don't go out of your way to attack the source of healing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, it can take so much punishment, you don't actually end up <em>killing it</em>.</span>
</li><li> Among the bosses of the Arachnorb family, the Shaggy Long Legs in the third takes the longest to defeat because the player has to unveil the weak point first, and for that all eight knots of hair (located in the legs) have to be dealt with. It doesn't help that the boss has a bad habit of moving from one place to another, forcing the captains to either go on foot to the proper destination to resume the fight, or split up to intercept the boss (which itself is risky if one of the captains is currently low on Pikmin).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> fights count as this as well, especially if you're trying to catch them: every legendary has an exceptionally low catch rate, forcing you to waste tons of Ultra/Dusk/Timer Balls (or just get extremely lucky). You can avoid this with a Master Ball, though you usually only get one per game, and they really should be used on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoamingEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoamingEnemy">Roaming Legendaries</a>.
</li><li> Elizabeth Greene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>. Depending on how you've set up Alex and how you use artillery, tanks, and helicopters, you can potentially take down Greene in, oh, say, fifteen minutes of continuous pounding.
</li><li> The Brain Tank from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>. The only time you can even hurt it is for a brief moment when it occasionally tries to charge you. And you have to hit it quite a few times. It is also throwing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> bombs at you the whole time, and this is merely phase 1, and you don't get to heal at all in the much more difficult phase 2.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> has King Hippo, a fat, overgrown boxer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartsUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartsUnknown">Parts Unknown</a> that has an amount of HP so large that it is only required to known him down once to win. And in the Wii version, when fought in Title Defense mode, he'll tie a manhole cover to his belly so you can't hurt him there without removing it first, which only prolongs further the fight.
</li><li> The final fight against the Thugs 4 Less leader in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em>. Mostly because you'll be sat in a turret, constantly trying to shoot away his bombs, rather than actually just shooting him. Even the developers admit he simply has way too many hit points.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2hne4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2hne4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2hne4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though if you take off his last hit points with one of your standard weapons, it gets a HUGE boost of Weapon EXP.</span>
</li><li> Reflux, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a> 3: Hoodlum Havoc</em>, has 4 phases. The first form requires you to alternate between taking down his barrier before slugging him in the face. He then shoves his scepter into his back and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">grows larger.</a> You then spend your time circling the arena before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">climbing up his back</a> and hitting his scepter to damage him. After that, he'll ascend into the air, with you having to climb up platforms before you can fire a missile at his scepter. Lose at any point until the final phase and you'll have to start from Phase 1 again. After <em>all that</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">the game saves your progress</a> so you face Reflux's final form. His final form consists of a shooter segment where you have to destroy his barrier then shoot him in the face. Once he hits the ground, you have to kill off all the Hoodlums he spawns to stop him regenerating. The two phases alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">until he turns to crystal</a> and shatters. Fortunately the last thing to do is use a technique to turn Andre back into a Red Lum, something you've already done several times. Whew.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em>, while the time needed to beat them may pale in comparison to some other examples on this page, any song that reaches over eight minutes or so becomes one of these. "Do You Feel Like We Do" (Live) from <em>Guitar Hero 5</em> pushes it even further with almost <strong>fourteen</strong> minutes of playing.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">"Freebird"</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of GH2, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce">"Through The Fire and Flames"</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of GH3.
</li><li> Also, the Endless Setlist challenges in the numbered titles are <em>guaranteed</em> to take over an hour. Subverted slightly in that you can pause in the middle of any song... unless, of course, you want that Steel Bladder achievement, in which case you have to never pause the game and never fail a song during the <em>entire setlist</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Rock Band</em>, the Endless Setlist challenges will take (on average) 5+ hours. The challenge itself is to play the entire game's tracklist in one concert. 84 songs x 3(on average though usually higher) minutes, = approximately 300 minutes, or 5 hours.
</li><li> Another example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>'s "One", which, while only just short of 8 minutes, starts with a 30-second intro of <em>absolutely no playing</em>. Seeing as the song waits until the five-minute mark before trying to wear you down with a carpal tunnel-inducing riff, and then a minute later unleashes a sudden, difficult solo that can crush you in <em>seconds</em>, you'll likely be wasting <em>far</em> more time trying to beat it than you should.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts">Shadow Hearts</a></em> that is required for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding">Good Ending</a> is a real grind. It's not particularly challenging, as its attacks don't vary much, but the fact that you have to fight it with only one character, who takes all the damage and has to do all his own healing, can make the fight last half an hour or more.
</li><li> The third Sister Grimm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowsOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowsOfTheDamned">Shadows of the Damned</a></em>. There's actually a health vendor in the boss arena, which you will likely need if you don't know her weakness (fully charged skull blasts to the core).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Noah, who likes to change what elements he takes damage from regularly and is one of the few things resistant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental">Almighty</a> spells, so if you don't have demons with multiple elemental attacks you will have a long-ass battle on your hands, and even if you do it's still going to take a while.</span> Even worse is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucifer, who boasts Almighty resistance, and resistance to everything to else on top of it. Unlike Noah, however, Lucifer doesn't shuffle resistances and open up holes in his defense. There is a setup that can punch through his defenses for pretty good damage, but it requires building that setup from the beginning of the game, and even then the battle can take the better part of a half-hour if Lucifer's AI is feeling merciful. If you didn't go for the aforementioned build, you'll be there for <em>hours</em>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> Ancient of Days and Sanat Kumaya. The former especially, as it has Diarahan (a spell that restores <em>all of its health</em>) and it will spam it if you hit its weakness (this forces you to get <em>another</em> DLC that provides the only source of the Brand ability other than Ancient of Days himself). The third DLC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, Masakado's Shadow, would be this if not for the fact that it has a turn limit, especially since it doesn't hit terribly hard compared to the other two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> has a few, mostly ship battles like; Georgio, the Hydra and of course Zelos (hell, all of the gigas count really). But it also has a tortoise boss battle where the boss can put up a shield to prevent you causing any damage and it will heal itself. It'll do this around every four turns so you better hope you can cause enough damage to keep up with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dark Gaia, final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> will force the player through multiple rounds of at least three different, yet similarly difficult styles of gameplay that must be executed with near flawless precision to win. Mercifully, the game marks each genre change as a checkpoint of sorts, meaning that deaths aren't <em>too</em> frustrating.
</li><li> Previously, many of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em> were quite time-consuming, because they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">such a large amount of HP</a> compared to the player's output. Egg Emperor took this to the point of being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">Goddamned Boss</a>.
</li><li> Fighting Metal Sonic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> can take even longer than the stage itself. You first have to run along a road with Metal Sonic attacking you. Then, he gets into a machine too high to reach requiring you to ricochet his minions into him (which can get quite frustrating if you keep missing). Then, you travel along another road with Metal Sonic attacking you. And THEN you fight him directly. Each of these parts is the length of a normal boss fight in most of the rest of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em>: Did you forget to turn off your auto-blaster when meeting the Grox? Congratulations, you now have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> month's worth of fighting to do to defeat them, because peace offerings don't work.
</li><li> The Sa-Matra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em>. First you have to fight through a bunch of Ur Quan dreadnaughts before taking out all of the Sa-Matra's shields and then piloting a bomb into the Sa-Matra itself. And to make matters worse, the most effective strategy is to use Pkunk ships with only a weak, short range weapon.

Six small hitboxes that are a nightmare to hit. And all of them need to be hit.

You have three fights in a row against him (each time with 6 different characters), in which he may or may not kick everyone's behinds before proceeding to the next one. Depending on your teams, each battle can take up to 10 to 15 minutes each, though it should be noted that the first two battles will end early if your teams manage to do enough damage to him, and that if said teams do their job well the last one will be able to beat him rather quickly. On the other hand, if your first two teams don't manage to weaken him at all, the last one will have a very long battle on its hands, and it's not guaranted that Riou will be able to keep everyone alive until he's defeated because of his limited usage of the Bright Shield Rune. And after all that you get to run after a fleeing Blight, fight a few mooks, and finally you kill him... after a one on one duel in which he may OHKO you if you pick a single command wrong<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3kc1w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3kc1w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3kc1w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> During the Duel, you can see his life bar, showing how much life he has remaining after getting thrashed by 18 extremely powerful people: <em>a quarter</em>.

It starts as a big, phantom-like manta ray, and can split into up to <em>64</em> smaller rays, which spread across the coast of Sirena Beach as they spill electric goo; this forces the player to both clean up the mess and eliminate the rays one by one.

It has a grand total of 200 HP, which is 50 more than the final boss (both actually being big numbers in this game). It will prolong the fights by causing Confusion and healing itself for 20-30 HP per heal, amongst other things. Woe be you if it defeats you after you trekked down all 100 floors to get to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Culex</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, with his four Crystals and a total of over 12,000 HP between the five (with Culex himself having the most). Though you can speed things up a little by focusing your attacks on Culex, that means you'll have to endure the bombardment from him and the Crystals. It's a long fight no matter how you approach it.
</li><li> All of the final bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> series take a while. They all have various body parts that need to be destroyed before their weakpoint is exposed, and this weakpoint only stays around for a few turns. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dark Bowser and the Dark Star Core</span> from <em>Bowser's Inside Story</em> deserve special mention since they are technically two final bosses in one, and repeating the first part is practically assured unless the Mario Bros. are really overleveled. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dreamy Bowser</span> from <em>Dream Team</em> also deserves mention, as he heals a lot (and can't be attacked while doing so, as you have to defeat his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> first), which can stretch the final battle out for <em>over an hour</em>, especially on Hard mode.

The Challenge Medal increases health and defence by 50%; to put this in context, only one mandatory boss has over 2000HP in the vanilla game but the Challenge Medal means bosses from the middle of the game start to have this much HP.
</li><li> The final fight with Bowser from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></em> is definitely this and is considered one of the longest Bowser fights in the entire series. He technically has <strong>five</strong> different phases with the first four being puzzle fights. He has tons of HP, tons of attacks, and tons of tricks that have this fight take almost forever and all is this is AFTER a tough fight with Kamek. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">you can go back and heal and save after defeating Kamek and don't have to worry about fighting him again.</a>

All of the last three stages (four if you face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>) are going to have over a million HP's worth of bosses, and that doesn't even include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>' HP. There are also the end bosses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Alpha Gaiden</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">Shu</a> regens ALL his health 5 times.
</li><li> The fourth installment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> has the final battle at the end of Classic Mode, which just keeps adding on forms as the difficulty slider increases. At the highest difficulty required to fight the battle in its entirety (7.5 in the 3DS version and 6.0 in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> version), the final battle has a whopping <em><strong>six</strong></em> (<em>five</em> for 3DS) phases. That's Master Hand/Crazy Hand and all of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Core's forms: Master Giant, Master Beast, Master Edges, Master Shadow, and in the Wii U version, Master Fortress</span> before the whole thing is through.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> who unlocks your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a>, Abyssion, is also a Marathon Boss, featuring higher HP than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> and a more dangerous base of attacks. The recommended strategy for dealing with him is to use an "All-Divide," an item which halves all assigned damage and thus makes it even <em>more</em> of a marathon. The reason this is considered an improvement is that it does not change the effectiveness of your healing, essentially making <em>those</em> spells double-strength. Later ports of the game have the boss nullify All-Divides, making them pointless.
</li><li> Another Tales' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Nebilim</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, is basically the same, except that there's no All-Divide. Fortunately her damage output has been adjusted downward.
</li><li> Any of the "giant monster" bosses from <em>Abyss</em>'s Unknown Mode, especially Replicantis. The very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">monster</a></em> <em>battle</em> on Unknown usually takes about 15 minutes, just to get an idea.
</li><li> A rare <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> example in which the Marathon Boss is <em>not</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a> 2</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortuna</span>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> takes <em>forever</em> to beat. Look up videos of it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and you'll notice that they're often split into multiple parts or have most of the fight edited out. The only indication that they're going down is that the music changes.
</li><li> Magnadeus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> from the same game, can also take quite some time to defeat, though not usually as much time as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fortuna.</span>
</li><li> On higher difficulties, almost every single boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em> ends up like this, due to how low the party's overall damage output is compared to other games in the series and the fact that bosses can escape from combos a lot more easily then in previous games. Only once one has fully powered up the Fell Arms and/or boosted their party's stats significantly with items do they go down in what could be considered a normal span of time.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> mode <em>Mann vs. Machine</em>, several of the Giant Robots come across as this. Particular mention should go to the Black Box Giant Soldier, who not only has a huge amount of HP, but 'heals on hit'. Not only do players have to drain his health, they have to avoid even getting hit. There are also other robots running around with the bomb, making it even more difficult.
</li><li> Both Orcus and General Akhboob from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalCarnage">Total Carnage</a></em> take quite a pounding before they go down. The game goes as far as to worn you that Orcus is "the mother of all boss monsters", and you can expect to spend over five minutes pumping rounds into him. Also, of the two, Akhboob is the only one with a health meter. And they're the only bosses of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Yukari Yakumo</a>, who takes <em>over 10 minutes</em> to defeat, and over 15 minutes if you try to time out her attacks (say, to graze for score). Many shmups take about 20-30 minutes to complete, total. And to even <em>get</em> to Yukari, you have to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Extra boss</a> Ran Yakumo. <em>Twice.</em> You see, Yukari's not PCB's Extra boss. She's the Phantasm boss. No other Touhou game <em>has</em> a Phantasm stage.
</li><li> In general, every Extra boss in the Touhou series is relatively guilty of this. The only thing that really puts Yukari in a league of her own is her final card/attack, Danmaku Bounded Field. She's invincible during the whole thing, and it lasts for a minute and a half. Have fun. The timer for her last card stops any time you die or bomb until your invincibility wears off, unlike every other time-out card in the entire series. Have fun, indeed.
</li><li> Typically, the last spellcard in any game is absurdly long. The average spellcard lasts about 15-20 seconds, 45 if you're going for the timeout. Final spellcards can last <em>two and a half minutes.</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1MR9jOpH94">Kanako Yasaka's final card is particularly terrifying.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Once again, Yukari takes the cake.

He has 7 different forms, can switch between the first 6 at will, and when he isn't using other forms, they actually regenerate HP. When added together, his collective HP <em>more than triples</em> that of the previous boss (Yukari) and her 3 forms.
</li><li> The titular enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrillionGodOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrillionGodOfDestruction">Trillion: God of Destruction</a></em> has, as you might expect, a trillion health. While each technical battle against it doesn't usually take very long compared to the grind, whittling it down is the focus of the entire game. It helps that the Overlords deal millions of damage per hit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>:
<ul><li> This could easily be a player's first encounter with Undyne if he/she is not informed (at least, on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a> it could be.). The trick is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">flee from her every time you turn back to red SOUL mode</span>, but the only hint you get for this is a single text-box at the start of her fight.
</li><li> A more literal example in the same game is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sans on a No Mercy run</span>. The entire boss fight is meant to make you quit. On top of it, he literally dodges all of your attacks, making it impossible to hit him until he uses his special attack, which consists of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> absolutely nothing. He puts you in the bullet board, and tries to make his turn last as long as possible</span>. The only way to beat him is to cheat by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> waiting for him to fall asleep, pushing the bullet board over to the fight button, and hitting it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> game <em>Viking Clan</em>, world bosses are meant to be fought by thousands of players together (anyone can take part in the battle). The Phoenix, the weakest of these bosses (Level 10, apparently), has <em>26,343,750,000</em> health points. That's 26 <em>billions</em>. The battle is timed, lasting 14 days, and individual players must wait 4 hours between attacks. Fortunately, it's really just a question of length as it doesn't seem to heal and deals very little damage.

<ul><li> Lieutenant Lech Kril is coated in armor that is invincible to every single form of damage that the Tenno can inflict upon him. He can only be harmed when he slams his hammer into the ground, and only in four coolant tubes on his back. Without knowing this detail, the fight can go on forever.
</li><li> Councilor Vay Hek Terra Frame can only be damaged by shooting his head, but this weak spot of his is absolutely tiny. He also repeatedly retracts his head behind an invincible mask when he takes more than a set amount of bullets (not damage) per cycle. This fight can last more than an hour unless the Paris Prime or Dread bows are used to get critical damage.

<ul><li> The game has Yggralith Zero and Telethia Plume, who are fought in online squad missions. It's not too challenging for a properly outfitted team to bring their health bar down to zero - but they each have several <em><strong>million</strong></em> health bars. At least you're not expected to finish them in one sitting, or finish them at all; beating one of these bosses is a worldwide event in which players from across the globe do what amounts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> on the boss in timed increments, in hopes that everyone's collective efforts will have the monster defeated before the event ends.

It has <em>one hundred million</em> HP, the highest of any non-Global Nemesis enemy in the game despite being just level 74, but unlike the Global Nemeses mentioned above, you <em>have</em> to kill this one in a single sitting. There's ways to reduce that HP relatively fast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">absurd builds</a>, but it's a testament to its resilience that even the strongest builds in the game can't one shot it and take a while to bring it down.
</li></ul></li><li> Bosses in the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a></em> games get most of their difficulty from this trope.
<ul><li> In the first game, you're evidently supposed to fight the final boss at level 24 (that being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC88">PC-88</a> version and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a>), but walkthroughs for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16">TurboGrafx-16</a> version generally recommend level 40 so you're killing him by a method other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>. It's a bit harder to tell what level you're supposed to be at for the second game's fights, but killing every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> you see, then consistently hitting the boss with fully powered-up attacks, leaves you doing so little damage that you need to hit the bosses twice to even notice a change in their screen-spanning life bars.
</li><li> Darm in <em>II</em> is also a really long boss fight, even with your EXP maxed out. Then there's his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">teleport spamming</a> and the constant rain of fireballs you must dodge.
</li><li> Arem, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys</em>, takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. He has three lifebars (the last form fortunately is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel">Clipped-Wing Angel</a>), a laundry list of powerful attacks, is hard to hit, your attacks only do minuscule damage even with max EXP, and he can regenerate his HP.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jubileus</span>, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em>. You fight her for a while and take away a bit of health, then avoid fire balls in a lava field, then ice balls in an ice field, then thunder balls in the middle of a freaking <em>hurricane</em>, then fight her directly again for a while, then bond her with your hair and take away the last of her health, then punch her from Pluto to the sun while avoiding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">crash her into a planet</a>. And <em>finally</em> you have to destroy what remains of her body. The whole process will take a good ten minutes even for the best players, and likely twice as much the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath">Asura's Wrath</a></em>: Counting the cutscenes, the final boss fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chakravartin</span> lasts a full hour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> has Grurn, the final boss at the end of the official plug-in <em>Siege at Firemoth</em>. Grurn has 2000 hp with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">regeneration effect</a>. For comparison, the final boss of the <em>Tribunal</em> expansion is a legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> with 3000 HP and the <em>Bloodmoon</em> expansion's is an aspect of a god with 2000 HP, and neither possesses regeneration. Grurn's attacks aren't anything special, and if you have decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Resist Shock</a> effects, he is almost incapable of harming you. That said, he still takes forever to kill.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Uses of this trope outside video games:</h3>
<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em> had a plethora of final bosses who were incredibly hard to kill, but the one who probably took the cake was Frieza, who even had a hope spot where they THOUGHT he was dead only to come back and kill Krillin. In the anime, the fight against Frieza took up <em>30 episodes</em>, 22 of which were specifically Goku vs Frieza.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob">Noob</a></em>, the Source of Chaos, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame">Horizon's</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> in early installments, is this. To top it off, one of the characters is famous for having beaten it <em>on his own</em>, which took even longer. The timeframe for the latter accomplishment is seven hours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>
<ul><li> The upper echelons of the series most powerful fighters are full of these. As a result, battles at this level tend to be marathon bosses fighting each other, and their battles are known to last multiple days. One of the first such battles shown in the series is Portgas D Ace, at the time an up and coming pirate, vs Jimbei, a Warlord of the Sea with ties to the pirate emperor Whitebeard, which took place over five days before Whitebeard intervened personally and recruited Ace.
</li><li> These battles can also be highly destructive. The island of Punk Hazard was host to a battle between Marine Admirals Akainu and Aokiji for the right to become Fleet Admiral. Their battle went on for ten days, turned Punk Hazard into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailfirePeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailfirePeaks">Hailfire Peaks</a> due to their respective magma and ice powers, and ended with Akainu the victor.
</li><li> Jack, a commander of the Emperor, Kaido, fought the combined might of Zou fought for five days straight, trading between day and night shifts to offer Jack as little opportunity to rest as possible. Despite that, the fight could <em>easily</em> have taken much longer than even that had Jack not gotten impatient and had the place bombed with poison gas.
</li><li> Luffy fights two of Big Mom's top commanders, the Sweet 3, and both fights take half a day or longer. His fight with Charlotte Cracker takes over eleven hours and he wins largely thanks to assists from Nami. Against Charlotte Katakuri, however, it's just the two of them one-on-one, and Katakuri shows himself to be more powerful and possess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">Combat Clairvoyance</a> on top of that. That fight takes Luffy almost an entire day to finally win, and only manages it by the skin of his teeth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ProblemSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ProblemSleuth">Problem Sleuth</a></em>: The final boss fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Demonhead Mobster Kingpin</span> took up over half the comic, spawning an absurd number of fresh HP gauges at one point; being that the comic was a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG">Eastern RPG</a>s, this was very likely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of the trope. Lampshaded by Problem Sleuth himself in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter">Strongly Worded Letter</a> to the final boss.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> novels, Kirito told Lizbeth of the time he participated in a raid against a floor boss that was fairly weak, but had so many hit points that it took them <em>two days</em> to kill. They had to fight it in shifts so that every squad in the raid party could get some sleep.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuushaGojoKumiaiKouryuugataKeijiban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuushaGojoKumiaiKouryuugataKeijiban">Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban</a></em>, Oracle Hero and his companions manage to defeat a god by hacking away at him nonstop for a whopping <em>3 years</em>. It's a good thing that the god was nice enough to refrain from using his regenerative powers during the battle.
</li><li> In the video game-themed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid">Kamen Rider Ex-Aid</a></em>, the two secondary Riders Brave and Snipe finally settle their mutual score with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Graphite</a> to advance to the final boss of the real-life game they have to beat to stop the spread of the Bugster virus once and for all. Their 2-v-1 lasts from <em>night all the way till the daytime</em> until the two Riders finally scrape the win, though they don't deal the finishing blow, saving that for their ally, the only official player of the game, and therefore, the only one who can properly clear each boss.
