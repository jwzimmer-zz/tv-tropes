</p><p>Whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair">good or evil</a>, a person's hair comes to symbolize honor, social status, and otherwise serves as a human peacock tail, representing a life rather than a fashion statement. Hair is not merely a possession or a symbol, but a part of a person's <em>physical body</em>. Thusly, having it forcibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">cut off</a> isn't just a minor fashion <em>faux pas</em>, but akin to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">rape</a></em>; and is likened to having your life stolen from you.
</p><p>From another view, a forced haircut serves as the symbolic initiation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">worse things to come</a>. To women, this may be traumatic due to the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine">Long Hair Is Feminine</a>.
</p><p>A minor subtrope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">involves having long hair being the source of a hero's powers</a>, or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">commitment to obey God's command for you personally not to cut it</a>.

As their third year in high school starts, Chiyo-chan spots Tomo with short hair, having spent their first two years with shoulder-length hair. Worried that she might have had a falling out with a boyfriend, she asks Yomi... who busts a gut over it. Tomo explains that her lofty ideas for beauty were a little too high and she just wanted something shorter.

It's implied Yumichika did it deliberately in an attempt to make Charlotte release sooner rather than later — it worked. It's also a call back to Yumichika's fight with Ganju, who knew he was weaker and less skilled than Yumichika so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">tossed a firework</a> at Yumichika's hair which won him the fight... because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">the very vain Yumichika</a> was left with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">Funny Afro</a> (he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">uses a wig</a> to cover it up).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em> after main character Tsukushi Makino gets kidnapped by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Junpei Oribe</span> his accomplices cut a huge hunk of her hair off as proof they have her to give Tsukasa Domyouji in order to lure him into a trap since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they wanted to beat him up because of things he did in the past</span>. The cut and her mother's well-intentioned but awkward attempt to fix it leaves Tsukushi looking <em>terrible</em>, until Rui manages to cut it in a more manageable way.
</li><li> A very young (read: no older than 12) Sylia Stingray gets her head shaved fully bald in the flashbacks of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 2040</em>, per <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> father</span>'s orders; it's to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> subject her to brain surgery, which provided Dr. Stingray with the material and data that would ultimately create the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Galatea</a>.</span> Later, little Sylia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryHairstyleChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryHairstyleChange">has a pixie-like cut</a> and a bandage on her head, and when seen as an adult she's let it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine">grow past her shoulders</a>.
</li><li> The manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> shows that Chrono's hair was worn long as a child up until a battle right after what would have been his coming-of-age ceremony. During the battle his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> is burned off to the shorter, jagged cut that he wears the rest of the time (in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize">true form</a>). It seems pretty symbolic of Chrono losing his innocence, particularly since the battle marks the start of the trauma that eventually leads to him becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight">Failure Knight</a>, if not downright developing PTSD (it's also worth noting that when he meets Rosette and Joshua in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize">Sleep-Mode Size</a>, his previously short hair has grown long again, possibly hinting that he <em>regains</em> some of his innocence by spending time with the children).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>, Clare and Teresa were both originally proud of their long, black hair. The process used to give them their powers turns their hair platinum blonde. Clare also is forced to cut her hair during training. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clare accidentally cuts off a lock of Galataea's hair while rescuing her from Agatha, who's holding Galataea hostage.

</li><li> A funny example is the fact that Allen and Kanda threaten to shave the other's head. During a sparring practice they wagered their hair on the outcome.

He cuts the knot himself, and, while upset, is very stoic about the whole affair; the village elders, who have to watch, are mired in despair and several of them start sobbing as soon as the deed's done. It is never once even implied that he should commit suicide though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">probably because no one expects him to survive for much longer anyway</a>.

Since Ranma isn't aware of Akane's reasons to keep her hair long, after it gets hacked off he blurts out "B-but it's just hair, why would she be THAT angry?"; then one of Akane's school friends harshly rebukes him, saying that "a woman's hair is her life". Only <strong>then</strong> Ranma and Ryoga realize that it was a bigger deal than they thought and start to apologize. Akane herself explains her reasons to Ranma a little later.

After the same revelations, Usagi locks herself in her room for at least two days. When the others get in, they see it's because her already super long hair is growing to <em>immense</em> speed and volume, and she's had to invoke the trope and continuously hack it off.

Despite Yusuke's protests, Koenma offers to save them both for a price. When the deed is done, Koenma reveals that, in return for them to be saved, he had to take something away from her body, which scares Yusuke off his pants, thinking she had lost an arm or a leg. When he realizes the fire had just singed the tips of Keiko's hair and she had to cut it short, Yusuke is pissed at Koenma because he made him think such terrible things.

Yup, Pre-Crisis Lex Luthor's original reason for turning evil was that, whilst he and Superboy were friends, one accident causes Lex Luthor... To lose all of his hair prematurely! "Oh no, my life is ruined! I'll get you for this, Superboy!" It's not nearly that simple. Lex had just created living matter in the lab, and with it he was preparing a treatment to immunize his friend Superboy to Kryptonite. A lab fire and Superboy's precipitate action to extinguish it destroyed the matter, and the fumes rendered Luthor bald. He resented both, but <em>the destruction of his artificial life and the kryptonite cure</em> were what <strong>really</strong> unbalanced Lex (and maybe all those weird fumes had something to do with it...).

Oddly for this trope, the cutting isn't shown beyond a panel of a lock of her long hair being held up to a knife, it's already done by the next panel. Odder still is the fact that she clearly hates her circumstances but seems to give no thought to her haircut, to the point of it never being mentioned by her or Balder when they're reunited- perhaps to emphasize the tenderness of the once famously handsome, now white-haired and paunchy Balder and his ragged, shorn, formerly glamorous lady-love not caring that they're both a sorry sight compared to their old selves and just being happy to see each other again.
</li><li> Thor's own girlfriend Sif cared a <em>lot</em> when Loki shaved her head in a deliberate ploy to make her less attractive to Thor. Sif had the last laugh, though- Thor liked her new hair, which turned black after Loki backed out on paying the dwarves who made it out of gold, better than he'd ever liked her old blonde locks, and found her even more strikingly beautiful than before.

Instead of using the clippers, they use <em>scissors</em> while she struggles the whole time leading the nuns to draw blood. Quite handily, this, and the following work montage, allow us to see that A LOT of time has passed since the the girls arrived as Bernadette's hair is even longer when she finally escapes than when she arrived. Might also have happened to Crispina, who has an uneven haircut and is unstable enough that she might have tried to escape like the others.

Sadly, she's already done this to herself, cutting her long locks into a bob in preparation to become a prostitute because she has no other means to support herself.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlowersInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlowersInTheAttic">Flowers in the Attic</a></em> plays the trope normally; the grandmother knocks Cathy unconscious and screams "You are a sinner!" before hacking off her hair with a comically vast pair of scissors.

</li><li> The movie <em>She's In The Army Now</em> features a group of unprepared women joining the army for basic training. The women are allowed to keep their hair long if they make sure it's above the collar at all times.

This is apparently based off rumours that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> had a fetish for hair-cutting.

Of course given what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">happens to him</a> throughout the film, the haircut is probably the least traumatic thing about his time inside.

She refused to cut it even when Miles Vorkosigan came to the rescue (to her disgust, he compared it to animals gnawing through their limbs to escape a trap), so he had to distract her in order to cut it without her consent. With a knife. She was a bit upset afterwards. Also, a different noblewoman later gives Miles a lock of her hair; it's a surprisingly moving token of her esteem.

It was a deeply shaming punishment to have these spines clipped. When one of the aliens befriended by the protagonist (a junior member of the human diplomatic staff) had it done, the protagonist told her that someone once cut her hair off to shame her, but she dyed the remnant bright red and gloried in it. The clipped aliens are inspired to put beads on their spines and walk tall, which angers those who clipped them, but they don't care.

This is one of the more obvious examples, as in a good chunk of the series' world, a woman's hair is directly and explicitly tied to her status, and Kahlan has the longest locks around. She also lops off a bit of her own hair. That doesn't <em>sound</em> awesome, but Confessors are magically incapable of cutting their own hair, as part of an enforcement of the status symbol. A Confessor who cuts her own hair suffers debilitating pain. In part because of that knowledge, Richard realized that Kahlan really did love him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> despite putting the Rada'Han on his neck and sending him to the Palace of the Prophets</span>.

The TV movie does both - where the children can't remove the tar and Cathy just has Chris cut all her hair off.

</li><li> In Argentina there was a show called <em>El Último Pasajero</em> (The Last Passenger) in which two groups of teenagers in their last high school years competed for a graduation trip for the whole class division, which is a tradition between Argentinian students. One of the games, and the most viewed, consisted in a member of one team selecting someone from the opposite team, normally a pretty girl with long hair, in order to get him/her a horrible haircut. The teen could refuse but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">their classmates made that choice rather difficult, by insisting and treating the girl as a traitor if she didn't accede to the task</a>.

<ul><li> The first team to encounter the Fast Forward was a pair of professional models. Rather than seriously damage a part of their professional image, they decided against taking on the challenge and returned to the regular course.
</li><li> A husband-and-wife team, Uchenna and Joyce, came across this Fast Forward the second time it was offered. Uchenna was already shaved bald to begin with, so Joyce bravely let her long hair be cut off. Fortunately, Uchenna kept reassuring Joyce that she was still beautiful to him, even after sacrificing all her hair, and Uchenna and Joyce eventually won the race and the million dollars that season.

At least one girl with long hair will have a crying fit when she finds out it's getting cut short. As the seasons go on, and the haircuts seem designed to neither make the model look better nor be more acceptable to the world of fashion, the line between "necessary sacrifice" and "traumatic hazing ritual" gets thinner and thinner.
<ul><li> There was one girl who defined herself by her long hair. Guess what they did? Cut it off. All of it. Because that was how she defined herself. The poor girl performed badly for the rest of the time she was on the show because she was so traumatized.
</li><li> Season 5's Cassandra, whose hair was cut short (and who never stopped complaining about it), <em>quit the show</em> when Tyra wanted to cut it <em>even shorter</em>.
</li><li> Season 16 had the opposite case in Molly. The Diana Ross weave in the makeover episode irritated her scalp so much she was actually <em>euphoric</em> when she got her cut.
</li><li> Inverted with one of the male models, who started out with short hair but got extensions put in to give him a 'Jesus' look. It was every bit as ridiculous as it sounds. Another guy was given a facial hair weave, with similar results.

After it was all cut off, he had a hard time adjusting to the system. He ended up quitting the show. A Spanish spin-off had girls forced to get regulation haircuts too (to shoulder-length). Some of them really didn't take it well. A Dutch spin-off forced a black girl to remove all her extensions, leaving her hair very short.
</li><li> <em>Never Did Me Any Harm</em> - the father has his boys go through with these haircuts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">The Dandy</a> Joe really wasn't happy to get his haircut, annoyed at how old fashioned it was (which becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> when those haircuts came back into style). Dad relented and wouldn't force his oldest boy Theo to get the cut (as he had the longest hair).
</li><li> <em>Bad Lads Army</em> - modern teens had to join the army. In the first season, some recruits underwent this willingly: they had a choice between a buzz cut and going fully bald. Season 3 made the boys only get a short-back-and-sides, saying anything that could be hidden by a beret could be kept. One boy with purple dreadlocks had to be completely scalped to get rid of the dyed hair.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> the office fears that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a> resembles the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a> too much and asks her to dye her hair blonde. Eva revealed later than she had already just got her hair streaked, and the office wasn't happy with that, which is when they asked her to bleach it. She couldn't go through with it and instead chose to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead">Dark-Skinned Redhead</a> instead. Fortunately for her, the office liked the final result.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em>, Lois puts gum in Kristin's, who tormented Reese, motorcycle helmet. Malcolm mentions that the janitor ended up having to cut her hair with a hedgetrimmer. We later see Kristin's new hairdo when Diane breaks down in tears over her butchered dolls.
</li><li> The documentary <em>Whose Hair Is It Anyway?</em> features singer Jamelia traveling both to Russia and India to see fresh hair being cut to make hair extensions. The trope is inverted by both Jamelia and Tatiana - who collect the hair from the girls themselves - when they have to take hair from a thirteen-year-old. The girl is happy to sell it but Tatiana is left feeling shaken after taking it, and gives her the equivalent of £100 (much higher than she'd normally give). Jamelia is initially horrified when she sees the hair of Indian people being cut at the temple (including some children who are visibly scared at what's happening) - but then she discovers that the temple uses the money made from selling the hair to feed the poor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em>. Scotty notices that his mother has abruptly cut her hair. She offhandedly claims that she wanted to try something new. However, several episodes later, Scotty learns that she was raped (attacked while leaving the supermarket) and viewers quickly surmised that she got the haircut as a reaction to her ordeal.
</li><li> <em>Desperate Scousewives</em> - a Liverpool based reality series - had one girl getting a trim before a party. The hairdresser was distracted by his boyfriend for a moment, and cut a chunk of the girl's hair. The girl is unaware until the haircut is finished, and discovers that she's been given a bob. She shows what she thinks of it by putting a hat on immediately. The hairdresser tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blame his boyfriend for distracting him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>: Marshall agrees to let Lily's cousin, who's training to be a hair stylist, style his hair for their wedding and a miscommunication leads to the cousin giving Marshall ugly frosted highlights. In a moment of panic Marshall grabs an electric razor and cuts a massive chunk right out of the middle of his hair which just makes him look even worse. Lily eventually borrows a hat from the venue's gardener to cover it up.
</li><li> The BBC <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTripods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTripods">The Tripods</a></em>TV series adaptation has a scene with a young teen girl getting her head shaved while crying. The head shave is standard before the capping ceremony, and shes afraid of whats about to happen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage">A French Village</a></em>: Hortense gets her head shaved as the punishment for having sex with a German.

The blonde is horrified. The bad girls gets what's coming to her, though.

</li><li> In Wilfred y la Ganga's song "El Rap de la Abuela" ("Grandmother's Rap"), the narrator goes spend some time with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a> of a grandmother, who demands for him to both shave his beard and cut his hair short. The guy does the first, but not the latter... so the grandmother waits until he falls asleep and hacks his hair off.
</li><li> In "Deep Deep Trouble" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSimpsonsSingTheBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSimpsonsSingTheBlues">The Simpsons Sing the Blues</a></em>, Bart Simpson caps off his tale of sadness by saying that Homer took him down to the barbershop. In the video, we don't get to see the top of Bart's head until the end when he sings the last verses:
<div class="indent"><em>I said, "Please, sir, just a little off the top." <br/>Dude shaved me bare, gave me a lollipop, <br/>So on my head there's nothing but stubble. <br/>Man, I hate being in deep, deep trouble.</em>

<ul><li> In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> stories, Loki, Thor's best friend and the resident Trickster God, played a prank that involved shaving Sif. While no picnic for her, it was more traumatic for her <em>husband Thor</em> than it was for her (or at least, the story only focused on Thor's reaction). Thor had something of a hair fetish, so with Loki shaving his wife's hair, he was so angry he threatened to <em>kill</em> Loki if he didn't fix it. This lead to the origin of how Thor acquired his signature hammer Mjolnir, as well as several other keen aspects of both his and Odin's characters, and Loki's punishment in the end is one of the contributing factors that lead to his eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, and in turn Ragnarok itself.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> King Nisus of the Megarians had a red/purple lock of hair, which made him invincible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter">His daughter</a> Scylla (not the one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>) fell in love with the invading king, Minos, and cut it off to give to him. Unfortunately for her, Minos was utterly horrified at her lack of filial loyalty and ditched her. She and Nisus got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">turned into birds</a>, forever predator and prey. That's the Greek version; there may be others. In some versions, it turns out yes, it is 'that Scylla'. You do not murder your father, dearie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrauma">there are consequences</a>!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> After losing his precious locks to Delilah (and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">godlike strength</a>), Samson is captured by the Phillistines, has both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eyes gouged out</a>, and chained between two pillars to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk">serve as entertainment at a party</a>, making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. In this case, it wasn't the hair itself that was the source of power — God had decreed He would empower Samson so long as he followed the restrictions of a Nazarite but Samson broke every single one of them — getting his hair cut was the last straw, at which point God withdrew His blessing until Samson asked forgiveness and God gave him his strength back, allowing Samson to die honorably through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>.
</li><li> Also, the instructions for when an Israelite soldier decided that a (non-Canaanite) female prisoner of war was attractive. <em>After</em> the war was over, he was to take her into his home, shave her head and trim her nails, get rid of her old clothes and other cultural attachments, and give her a month to mourn her family and culture. After that month of mourning was up, she would become his wife. If he then decided that he didn't want her anymore, he was to let her go free, and was not allowed to sell her into slavery.

</li><li> An incident of forced shaving happened in the Bible to envoys sent by King David to the Ammonites (2 Samuel 10). In that case, the envoys only lost half of their beards... but they also lost the bottom half of their garments. The Ammonites came to regret their decision.
</li><li> In the Algonquin story "The Bride of Strong Wind," one of the many abuses Oochigeaskw suffers at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">her older sisters</a> is having her long hair cut off. Thankfully, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidHairGrowth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidHairGrowth">grows back</a> (among other miracles) after Strong Wind accepts her request to marry him.
</li><li> In Feudal Japan, sudden and inexplicable hair-cutting was known as "Kamikiri". Incidents were variously blamed on demonic winds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">kitsune</a>, and strange mantis-like insects.

Look for the loser to behave as if he's been through an exceptionally traumatic event, and attempt to cover up his shame with wigs, bandannas, and the like.
</li><li> The first really high profile and thus all the more humiliating shavings in Mexico came in 1942 when Bobby Segura, who would become known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskedLuchador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskedLuchador">unmasking luchadors</a>, put his hair on the line against El Enmascarado Rojo' in Arena Modelo at an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">EMLL</a> event and lost, resulting in the first (but not the last) shaving for his efforts. It was so dramatic EMLL gave Rojo another chance the next week, where he shaved Puma Valderrama and then put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto">El Santo</a> in a hair vs mask match against Bobby Bonales during their tenth Aniversario tour (Santo would not unmask for another forty one years so you know how that went)

Fuchi would take it well in the long run, becoming known for keeping his hair short, Onita, not so much.

Not the only example, but maybe the most disturbing. There's also Edge (to a smaller degree) in WWE, Seth Skyfire/Chet the Jet in OVW and Erick Stevens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>.
</li><li> During the 1986 Great American Bash tour, Jimmy Valiant faced Shaska Whatley in a hair vs. hair match, with Valiant winning by knocking Shaska out with a loaded glove. Shaska was still unconscious while the deed was done and woke up to find his hair lying on the mat. He tried to put it back on his head. Shaska got his revenge a few nights later when Jimmy Valiant faced Shaska's manager, Paul Jones, in another hair vs. hair match. Shaska interfered to help Jones win and stick it to Valiant. After the match, many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> wrestlers tried to stop Valiant from going through with it, telling him he could protest to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> Board over Shaska's interference. Valiant went through with it anyway.
</li><li> For years in the Memphis territory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> was undefeated in hair vs. hair matches. In 1987, he faced Austin Idol in a steel cage hair vs. hair match. The cage went around the entire ringside area to keep Idol's manager, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a>, from interfering, but Tommy Rich had been hiding under the ring since before the show started. Rich interfered and helped Idol win, leading to Lawler (who was EXTREMELY popular in Memphis) getting his head shaved. The haircut was evidently more traumatic to the fans, who rioted while it took place (one fan actually started climbing up the cage). Idol, Rich and Heyman needed a police escort to get back to the locker room.
</li><li> One especially disturbing example was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoddyPiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoddyPiper">Roddy Piper</a> shaving a struggling dwarf to resemble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT">Mr. T</a>, who he was feuding with at the time.
</li><li> Roddy Piper was also involved in the incident which gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake">Brutus Beefcake</a> the nickname "The Barber". Short version: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdrianAdonis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdrianAdonis">Adrian Adonis</a> cut Brutus's hair, essentially to be a dick. Piper (by this point a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a>) has his "retirement" match at <em>WrestleMania III</em> with Adonis (Piper's retirement lasted less than two years). Piper beats Adonis with a sleeper hold, knocking him out, at which point Beefcake returns and shaves Adonis bald.
<ul><li> During the lead-up to WrestleMania 3, Adonis teamed with Beefcake and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregValentine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregValentine">Greg Valentine</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickMartel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickMartel">Rick Martel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomZenk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TomZenk">Tom Zenk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LannyPoffo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LannyPoffo">Lanny Poffo</a> in a 6-man tag team match. By this time, the match between Piper and Adonis was already slated to be hair vs. hair. During the match, Beefcake had Martel backed against his team's corner and Adonis took out a pair of scissors, planning on cutting Martel's hair to show what he'd do to Piper. Martel switched places and put Beefcake in the corner, causing Adonis to cut his hair by accident.

This show, co-produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, was the first mainstream American exposure to the Mexican lucha libre style. The mask vs. hair match was also Barr's last appearance, as he would die later that month, and Eddie's first real exposure to an English-speaking audience during his pro wrestling career.

After being defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Victoria</a>, she was strapped into a barber's chair and had her head shaved, prompting her to wear wigs with a chin strap attached because she was so embarrassed. In reality, the whole thing was her idea, because she noticed there wasn't going to be a women's match at all on the roster and decided to take drastic measures. She considers it to be her single-favorite moment of her career, and kind of wished that it was more culturally acceptable for a woman to be bald, because she loved it. Hers was traumatic for another reason. During the head shaving, the plastic guard on the clippers came off and, combined with Victoria's inexperience with using hair clippers, chewed up Molly's scalp. She wasn't acting. She was in real life pain!
<ul><li> In 2013, at the opening of Victoria's wrestling-themed restaurant in Chicago, Molly showed up for revenge to give Victoria a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">Traumatic Haircut</a> of her own - with a kitchen knife!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> was shot with a tranquilizer dart and had his head shaved in the ring by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>. Most disturbing was that Angle was making noises like he was getting off on it, though nothing explicitly sexual, while announcer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Michael Cole</a> went on and on about how Angle was "raping Big Show of his dignity". Repeatedly. For several weeks afterwards when referencing the event. Kurt Angle himself is a victim of this, having lost a Hair vs. Hair match to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>. However, after a few weeks of embarrassing toupees, Angle has kept the look since. Supposedly, the whole reason they did that was because Angle was losing his hair anyway.
</li><li> At WrestleMania 23, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley">Bobby Lashley</a> beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> up and shaved his head after Lashley had defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga">Umaga</a>. Vince was humiliated and constantly covered his head with anything he could find, which led to a hilarious moment when he stuck his head up Lilian Garcia's skirt. Vince then vowed revenge and made Bobby Lashley's life a living hell for several months. Vince eventually grew his hair back.
</li><li> A few weeks before the WrestleMania 23 match, Vince and Umaga beat the crap out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NickDinsmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NickDinsmore">Eugene</a> and shaved his head, while boasting that the same thing would happen to Trump. Obviously, that didn't go as planned.
</li><li> At Sacrifice 2008, Roxxi Laveaux lost a hair vs hair match and got her head shaved. Similar to Molly Holly, it was necessary because her hair had been ruined from constant dyeing. She kept her bald look for several months before growing it back. Of note it was not the hair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">her opponent</a> on the line but that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AngelinaLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AngelinaLove">Angelina Love</a>, who with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBeautifulPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBeautifulPeople">The Beautiful People</a> stable (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky">Velvet Sky</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MadisonRayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MadisonRayne">Madison Rayne</a>) would often assault people and cut out chunks of their hair with scissors and sabotaged the match to ensure Laveaux lost. They had also been involved in an angle where "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaffneyUnger">The Governor</a>" fooled them into thinking she was Sarah Palin. Once Laveaux and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaylorWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaylorWilde">Taylor Wilde</a> revealed to them she wasn't, The Beautiful People were furious at being humiliated, triple teaming not Palin and cutting chunks off her hair.

After Tanahashi and Yano had it out for another four months, Tanahashi beat Yano in a hair versus hair match only for Takashi Iizuka of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CHAOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CHAOS">CHAOS</a> to attack him to prevent Yano from being shaved. When they instead tried to shave Tanahashi though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshihiroTajiri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshihiroTajiri">Yoshihiro Tajiri</a> made his official return to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> to save his former rival and ensure Yano was shaved.

Or if you want to be cynical, such women were easy targets compared to those in authority, who often kept their positions even after the war. Others were simply shot.
</li><li> The Nazis were fond of doing this to those consigned to concentration and death camps during the Holocaust, though that was mostly a matter of lice control, or, in some cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">to make stuffing, woven fabrics or boot lining</a>.

</li><li> There was the generally antisemitic practice of cutting off the <em>peyes</em>, or religiously significant side-curls and beards of Orthodox Jewish men.
</li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shaving">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, forced/required head shaving is used on prisoners and U.S. Marine Corps recruits, though for the latter it's probably more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a> variant is common to all branches. Army recruits have the "barely there" shave until the end of Basic. Also called 'peeling your scalp'. Drill sergeants intentionally invoke this trope as part of your introductory hazing. The more hair you arrive with, the more malicious glee they, and the barber, take in rubbing your nose in it. Female Officer Candidates in Navy OCS get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a> upon enrollment. They have their hair shorn down to less than two inches; this is singular in the US military, where most of the time women are required only to wear their hair off their collar and out of their face. Male OCs get the typical "high and tight" described by the Marine above. Females entering the U.S. Naval Academy also receive this haircut.
</li><li> In countries with conscription, like Russia (where it is especially hated) army hair cuts are truly traumatic haircuts.
</li><li> As back as late 40s there existed a non-conformist sub-culture, known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilyagi">"stilyagi"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which consisted mostly of youth intrigued by Western fashion and popular culture. Since having long hair (for men) was an iconic part of that subculture, it naturally led to this trope being employed as (mostly unofficial) "corrective measures".
</li><li> The Qing Dynasty was ruled by the Manchurians, who forced the Chinese to shave their foreheads and have a ponytail, called a queue, which became the stereotypical hairstyle of the Orient back in those days. Losing the ponytail was not only a loss of honor, but also punishable by death. As such, you can imagine why people were frightened when they heard stories about sorcerers or secret societies traveling about stealing queues. Given that Han Chinese hated the queue requirement across the board it would probably be better to say that having the hair cut (and shaved forehead that went with it) was the real dishonor. Cutting it off became the definitive method of declaring oneself a rebel against the Qing. And again, a declaration that others could make for one. When Han Chinese came to the U.S., they were often worried about cutting off their queues because once they did so, it would be impossible to return to their homeland. Cutting off the hair of a railroad worker often meant they could never escape their lot in life. The richer, western-educated Chinese would often have a wig made with queue, for ease of travel within China.
</li><li> Back in the day when the Rastafari were persecuted in Jamaica, cutting off their dreadlocks was a common nasty trick the police would do to them.
</li><li> In ancient Japan, a woman's hair <a class="urllink" href="http://www.h.ehime-u.ac.jp/~marx/courses/2004/fall/Hearn/Hearn-Hair.htm">was considered one of her greatest treasures<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Cutting her hair off against her will was considered to be on a level with raping her. So when it happens in anime it is significant by Japanese cultural standards (example: early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, when Keiko enters Yusuke's burning house to save his still dead body. While she succeeds, Koenma states that, in return for saving her life, he had to take something away from her body. That, as it turns out, was her then-long hair - handwaved in which the fire had burned the hair at its tips, so they had to be cut off already. Yusuke gets pretty mad at Koenma when he sees this).
</li><li> If a samurai lost his topknot in a fight it was considered far worse than losing his head, and he'd have to commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">seppuku</a> to regain his honor. The movie "Hara Kiri" explores this and other samurai rules of honor in depth (and the hypocrisy in which the rules were often applied).
<ul><li> During the Meiji Restoration, there was a concerted (and, eventually, successful) push to abolish the samurai class. One of the reforms implemented was banning topknots. Those born to the <em>shizoku</em> (privileged) class mostly opposed this move and many of them continued to wear topknots in defiance of the ban. As one of the responses from the Japanese government, schoolteachers were instructed to cut topknots off of any students that still wore the style (occasionally complicated in the more remote areas of Japan where the "schoolchildren" had delayed their education by a few years and weren't so much children as young men, fully capable of fighting off an overzealous teacher coming for their topknot). Gichin Funokoshi, one of the founding fathers of modern karate and a former schoolteacher himself, wrote in his memoirs about having to subdue unruly students for their government-mandated haircut and about the tears and frustration that often accompanied such actions.
</li></ul></li><li> When a rikishi (sumo wrestler) retires, part of the ceremony involves cutting off their top knot. Crying is not unheard of.
</li><li> Wearing one's hair in intricate braids was required among European women of standing, with only children wearing their hair simply. As having all those braids required long hair, cutting a woman's hair functioned to force her into an immature appearance.
</li><li> Chinese general <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao">Cao Cao<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> once violated his own orders when he carelessly allowed his horse to trample some crops; legend claims that he actually ordered himself beheaded, but his officers protested the order and he merely had his head shaved as a symbolic "beheading."
</li><li> Cutting the hair of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sikhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sikhism">Sikh</a>, who for religious reasons do not cut their hair or shave (although they wear turbans, so people in public never actually see their hair), can be considered a hate crime, because of the significance of it. If a Sikh needs to be shaved (anywhere on his body) — for surgery, usually — he may have to perform menial duties around the temple for a while as penance.
</li><li> It can happen that people who sport real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a>, which naturally requires a great deal of upkeep, may enter a period where they can no longer care for it — for example, falling into a deep depression with accompanying self-neglect that includes the hair — and as a result, the hair becomes unsalvageable and <em>must</em> be cut, sometimes only short, sometimes almost shaved off. Being that someone who puts in the effort to care for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> is probably very attached to it, no matter how necessary the shearing can be, it is <em>agonizing</em>.
</li><li> A law in Wisconsin makes it illegal to cut a woman's hair without her express consent.
</li><li> The kings of the Merovingian Dynasty that ruled the medieval Frankish Empire traditionally had long hair. When the last Merovingian king, Childeric III was dethroned by his mayor of the palace, Pepin the Short, he was sent to a monastery and tonsured (having his head shaved save for a strip of hair) like all the monks there, thus symbolically deprived of his royal powers.
</li><li> Patients about to go through chemotherapy for cancer will often shave their hair before hand, as the treatment is notorious for losing hair. This is often (and understandably) traumatic for the patient (ESPECIALLY if the patient is a woman) and for the family and friends, because it really confirms the patient's illness. It's not uncommon for family and friends to also shave their heads in solidarity with the patient.
</li><li> While not an actual hair <em>cut</em>, there was an incident a few years ago when some high school kids held down a girl (who was popular because of her long hair) and spread Nair (hair remover) on her head.
</li><li> It was once a vital stage of nuclear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecontaminationChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecontaminationChamber">decontamination</a> to shave off all the hair on one's body. However, because shaving can create tiny microscopic holes in the skin that allow radioactive particles to get through more easily, this is no longer done. Modern decontamination procedures just include removing clothing and showering, and preferably washing your hair with shampoo if possible. This ultimately averts this trope.
</li><li> Peter the Great of Russia, as one step of modernizing his empire made all state officials shave their beards off. For those who especially resisted, he would pay a personal visit to them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">cut their beards off with an axe</a>.
</li><li> In Chile, a 14-year-old schoolgirl wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">two very long</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">and noticeable braids</a> is questioned about it by her teacher. She doesn't pay attention, so the teacher forcibly takes her to the teacher's room and cuts them off. The poor girl is traumatised, the parents are understandably <strong>pissed off</strong>, and the case reaches public attention.
</li><li> A 15-year-old boy with hair past his shoulders <a class="urllink" href="http://www.elpinguino.com/noticias/107451/Apoderada_denuncia_al_Liceo_Sara_Braun_por_cortarle_el_pelo_a_su_hijo">went through the experience.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In the 19th century, the American government was dead-set on assimilating Native Americans into white society. One of these steps was sending thousands of American Indian children to boarding schools where they were "assimilated" through a variety of steps that directly interfered with their religious and cultural practices, a common one of which was only cutting one's hair in the event of grief or shame. When the children were subjected to forcible cutting of their braids, they were very traumatized indeed. This continued well into the twentieth century in Canada.
</li><li> In the book <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em>, the authors recount an incident of this that happened to one of the members of their support group for parents trying to improve their parenting techniques. The parent in question had curly hair that she was proud of, but her sister was jealous of. As a result, the parent's mother took her to the barber and had all her hair cut off.
</li><li> In 2010, in <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2010/01/the_trimet_barber.html">Portland, Oregon,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> there was a guy who sat behind women on the bus and cut off their hair or put glue in it.
</li><li> In Aceh, Indonesia (the only Indonesian state run by Sharia law) religious police arrested dozens of punks and (among other things) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16176410">forced them to shave their heads<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff">Katee Sackhoff</a> cut off her own hair <em>with a knife</em> on-camera in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>. Even though the haircut in the story was a way for her character to return to her old self (in-universe it was a trope inversion - the character had had short hair before, and the long hair was the symbol of trauma and misery for her, therefore the need to cut it), Katee cried afterward, especially since she'd been forced to keep her hair short earlier to play Starbuck - by the time the fourth season came around, she flatly refused to cut her hair any shorter for the role and her character stayed long-haired.
</li><li> Female murder victims (for example, Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, teenagers murdered by Canadian serial rapist and murderer Paul Bernardo and his wife Karla Homolka) are sometimes found with their hair cut, as a means of further humiliating them.
</li><li> In Utah, there was a case in which a thirteen-year-old and her friend befriended a three-year-old at McDonald's and cut off her long beautiful hair. The judge agreed to reduce the girls' sentence on the condition that the girls have their hair cut—even ordering the mother of the thirteen-year-old to cut off her daughter's ponytail in front of everybody in the courtroom.
</li><li> In Sweden, cutting someone's hair without consent is considered such a huge violation of human dignity it is classified as felony assault and battery.
</li><li> A pushy or inexpert hairdresser might sorta give you one of these <em>by accident</em> if you go for a haircut and they end up cutting it much shorter than you tell them. Many a person have been rather... upset after the stylist goes gung-ho on their hair like this. Rather worryingly, many hairdressers are noted to follow <em>extremely</em> outdated and conformist rules, especially regarding hair length. They're often trained to consider anything considerably past shoulder-length (on <em>women</em>, not men!) as "too long, time to chop." They will then do so <em>without telling the client,</em> and they often wonder why the now-upset person refuses to pay for something they didn't want and often didn't agree to.
</li><li> Minami Minegishi of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48">AKB48</a> was demoted to trainee and had her head shaved after she broke her band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">"no dating" rule</a>. The demotion was the band's idea but the head-shaving was Minegishi's.
</li><li> In 2011, members of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amish">Amish</a> splinter group forcibly cut the hair of mainstream Amish men and women and were charged with hate crimes. Hilariously, their leader's name is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2206288/Amish-hair-beard-cutting-ringleader-Sam-Mullet-GUILTY-hate-crimes.html">Sam Mullet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In Northern Ireland during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, British soldiers would frequently like to flirt with local girls. If the girl was Catholic, she had to rebuff their advances. Punishment for becoming involved with a British soldier (especially if he was Protestant) was to have the girl's hair publicly cut off before being tarred and feathered.
</li><li> Alex Pettyfer had to shave his head for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beastly">Beastly</a></em>. He claimed in an interview that it was especially traumatic for him as his hair had been a security blanket all his life.
</li><li> Anne Hathaway was not acting filming the above mentioned haircut scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables2012">Les Misérables (2012)</a></em>, as she sacrificed her own hair on screen. West End actress Nicola Sloane recalls them doing one take, where she chopped the front part of the hair off and Anne called for cut - soon bursting into tears when she felt how short the hair already was. They had to swap Nicola out for her hairdresser for the remainder of the scene. According to the actress, she was especially distraught because her wedding was coming up soon.
</li><li> Gwendoline Christie who plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda">Brawn Hilda</a> Brienne on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> said she cried after having to cut her long hair short for the role. As soon as the final season wrapped, she grew it out again.
</li><li> One <a class="urllink" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/07/world/americas/venezuela-hair-theft/index.html">delinquent "trend" in the early 2010s in Venezuela<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was attacking long-haired women, forcibly pulling their hair up in a ponytail, and cutting it with garden shears to sell it for hair extensions.
</li><li> Hair can easily break off due to chemical damage from perms/colors or even exposure to extreme cold, which can be just as traumatic. Not to mention the need to cut off hair if it becomes too damaged from this kind of elements.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> endured one of these in her tween years. Bedridden with typhoid fever, she had to have her long chestnut hair cut extremely short, as medical advice at the time believed it would ease the temperature in her head. Biographer Carolly Erickson notes that the princess was not fond of her own appearance, but her hair was considered lovely, and the loss of it was painful to her (once she was no longer dying and could think about it).
</li><li> Similar to Chemotherapy, Alopecia can cause hair to fall out and it often occurs without any warning and to people who are otherwise perfectly healthy. In some extreme cases of Alopecia Universalis, people can lose every single hair on their body in as little as a few weeks. Needless to say, such an experience can be very psychologically damaging, especially to women.
</li><li> In 2018 a teenage girl was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/teen-allegedly-forced-to-cut-hair-after-getting-highlights">allegedly forced to cut her hair as a punishment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after her mother got her highlights as a birthday present, by her own father and stepmother.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> among many cultures: Cutting one's hair is a very common sign of mourning in cultures that value long hair, so the haircut happens BECAUSE of trauma instead of resulting in it. Of course, this naturally leads people in those cultures to associate <em>all</em> haircuts with emotional distress, as mentioned above for North America; Many Native American/First Nations children who were shipped off to assimilation schools received forced haircuts to "civilize" them, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">the standard trope happened anyway.</a>
</li><li> Every so often, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow">Talk Show</a> will do an episode about makeovers. Almost inevitably, there is a long-haired woman who's been badgered into going by her "friends", is visibly unhappy about it, and comes away with a shoulder-length bob that leaves her fighting (or in) tears. This ends in praise from the host and her so-called friends.
</li><li> A sixteen-year-old high school wrestler called Andrew Johnson was subject to an impromptu one before a match. The referee claimed his dreadlocks didn't match regulations, and he'd either have to forfeit the match or cut them off. His dreadlocks were then haphazardly cut off, though he still won the match.
</li><li> A hairdresser on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricepeck/hairstylists-dont-deserve-this">Buzzfeed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> recalls a client being a teenage girl with beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a>. Her mother had caught her drinking beer with friends and as punishment was making her cut and donate the hair. When the hairdresser tried to leave it as long as she could, the mother screeched and made a scene about cutting it to shoulder length.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristoferHivju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristoferHivju">Kristofer Hivju</a> (best known as Tormund from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>) was pressured into cutting his famous hair and beard drastically shorter for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth">After Earth</a></em>. He didn't want to do it, and Jaden Smith tried to argue on his behalf, but the studio insisted. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedRole">most of his scenes were deleted</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>'s famous 'the Rachel' haircut was actually one of these. The story is either that the hairdresser made a mistake that he had to fix, was drunk at the time or else just felt like being elaborate. Jennifer hated the cut that resulted and grew it back as quickly as she could. This was parodied in a sketch on Jimmy Kimmel, where they recreated a scene from <em>Friends</em> and she refused to wear a wig of the haircut.
</li><li> In the Magdalene laundries in Ireland (as depicted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagdaleneSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagdaleneSisters">The Magdalene Sisters</a></em> above), nuns would often cut girls' hair if it was too long and pretty out of 'fear' it would tempt boys too much.
</li><li> Persis Khambatta, for her role as Illia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em>, had to have her hair shaved off for the role. She was distraught over having to shave it off (as Roddenberry refused to let her wear a bald cap), that she demanded insurance to be put on her hair should it not grow back.
