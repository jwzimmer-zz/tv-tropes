</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusume">Penguin Musume</a></em>, Kujira learns that she confessed her love to Sakura when they were both young girls (Kujira was raised as a boy.) Embarrassed into action, Kujira takes the Time-Penguin-X1 (yeah, you heard me) back to prevent herself from confessing.

Though Makoto never tries to change anything particularly big (she uses it for stuff like repeating a karaoke session over and over for several hours), once or twice she changes something small that has massive and unexpected repercussions. After several failed attempts at matching a friend with a girl who who likes him by leaping back in time, she finally gets it right. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He borrows Makoto's bike, the brakes snap and both he and the girl die in a train accident that Makoto herself only narrowly avoided earlier.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, this is the Defense Minister's argument against using the Eclipse Gate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to travel back in time to kill Zeref.</span> Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeref</span> is such a huge part of their history, killing him in the past could have drastic consequences. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it was revealed to the readers later on that Zeref is the one who proposed the concept of the Eclipse Gate, meaning the plan was doomed to failure from the start and wouldn't have ended well at all</span>.

</li><li> The entire Future Trunks Saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> is one big butterfly effect that messes up two timelines. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As Goku Black and Future Zamasu points out, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Future Trunks' time traveling</a> that allowed their rise since he created a timeline where Goku didn't die from the heart virus. If Goku had died, Present Zamasu would have never become interested in Goku and take his body using the Super Dragon Balls, which leads to Future Zamasu joining his past counterpart, killing the gods in every universe, and them eventually attacking Earth to punished the Earthlings for Trunks' crime</span>. Even more, Goku would have never even met Zamasu if Trunks didn't return to the past again to get help fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black</span>, since Goku only went to U10 to see if Zamasu was Black, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.

Wolverine goes back in time in order to kill Ultron's creator, Hank Pym, only to discover that in the new timeline, the murder of Hank Pym caused the Avengers to disband, which somehow caused Asgard to lose the Asgardian/Latverian War, which led to a present in which sorceress Morgan le Fay conquered most of Earth, and Iron Man leads a resistance of broken heroes trying to keep New York from falling into Morgan's hands. Apparently, this is worse than a universe in which humankind was completely annihilated by a sentient evil robot, as stated by the characters in the book.

That said, they <em>did</em> try and alter the timeline in three occasions... And every time it was somewhat 'strange':
<ul><li> the first time the Raider came in the present to assemble and activate a device <em>made purposefully to change the timeline without risking that the alteration would backfire</em>;

This later developed into a full-on ability to travel through time. What makes her notable is that her power breaks one of the fundamental laws of time travel in the Marvel Universe: That one is unable to change their own universe's past, and that any changes will result in the creation of a new universe. Tempus's power allows her to travel through her <em>own timeline</em> at will, sometimes with catastrophic changes to the future she's unable to anticipate (such as a small change in the past wiping out the family she had in the future).

Shadow ends up being a cruel ruler, leading to Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Knuckles' daughter Lara-Su to overthrow Shadow and set things right.

<ul><li> Roberts is kind enough to show us the appalling potential consequences of a <em>lack</em> of the war too, though. Cybertron's corrupt government is not overthrown because the Decepticons never rose up against it and in time was hijacked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Functionalists</a>, religious fundamentalists who enforce an increasingly strict social hierarchy with themselves firmly at the top. As time goes on they become powerful enough to bring into force 'obsolescence chips' which can insta-kill any Cybertronian not deemed useful enough - or who proves too rebellious. By the present day, Cybertron is a totalitarian police-state where constant surveillance, casual racism, and punitive mutilations are the norm. Then Rewind, whose memories were altered due to all the time travel, tried to kill Megatron's protoform in order to cause this future to come to pass. Because while it was absolutely horrific for Cybertron, it was a huge positive for the rest of the galaxy, which wasn't subjected to the horrors of 4 million years worth of Cybertron civil war. Rewind wasn't quite right in the head at the time.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> The majority of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> movie is Marty trying to reverse the effect of his having saved his father from being hit by a car.
</li><li> Over the course of the trilogy, changing the past has nothing but positive effects for most of the characters. But <em>not intentionally</em>. In fact, almost all of Marty's <em>intended</em> timeline changes end up nearly erasing him from existence. All the positive changes came from <em>unintentional</em> changes â€” most notably his "Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan" schtick, intended to spook George into asking Lorraine out to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance, instead gave him confidence to become a professional science-fiction author.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlindChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlindChance">Blind Chance</a></em> Witek is trying to catch a train. Depending on him making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissedTheBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissedTheBus">or not</a> (and failing or not a spot check), <em>his entire life</em> is going to go in completely different direction. But it's not the train itself that is the catalyst. The events in the train station are just the aftermath of a much more important event. After his father's death, Witek asks the dean for a few days to think things over. The rest of the story, including catching (or not) the fated train, follows from the choice that he made during this quiet downtime.
</li><li> "Timewaves" are the result of the change in history in the very loose film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoundOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoundOfThunder">A Sound of Thunder</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheButterflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheButterflyEffect">The Butterfly Effect</a></em>, named for the effect that names this trope. It's also notable for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the protagonist not only learning that messing with time can have disastrous consequences, but also realizing that he himself is the product of someone tinkering with fate. The world cannot be righted unless he does not exist</span>. Only in the director's cut, however, not the original theatrical release ending.
</li><li> This is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em>; the setup is the same, and the plague of strange events that follow lead him to return in time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and allow himself to be in bed when an airplane engine crashes into his house, thus saving his girlfriend's life in a roundabout way. A subversion: in the original timeline <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19898_5-heroic-movie-deaths-that-didnE28099t-actually-help-anyone.html">bad things happened ''without'' Donnie around to stop them.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span> More than that, the DVD commentary says that Donnie's purpose was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to give the plane engine a reason for existing, preventing the collapse of the universe.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTimeMachine2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTimeMachine2002">The Time Machine (2002)</a></em>, wherein Alexander Hartdegen's repeated attempts to go back in time to save his fiancÃ©e Emma inevitably go wrong. Later, the Uber-Morlock explains that the reason he cannot save Emma is that her death was his prime motivation for building the time machine.
</li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em>, a shortwave radio and the Northern Lights allow the main character to communicate with his father thirty years back in time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their conversations accidentally lead to the protagonist's mother (a nurse) saving the life of a serial killer who, in the original timeline, received a fatal overdose of medicine in the hospital. Since the murderer already had an obsession with nurses, and realizes she saved his life, this has worrisome consequences.</span>
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors">Sliding Doors</a></em> had a non-time travel variation. The movie recounts two chains of events, which follow the protagonist either missing the subway or getting on just in time.
</li><li> The film <em>Mr. Destiny</em> starring Jim Belushi as Larry Burrows, an unhappy middle aged office employed loser. He blames the state of his life on the moment he struck out in a high school baseball game. A guardian angel-like figure named Mike (played by Michael Caine) changes the past so that he hit the ball. Larry is now the president of the sporting goods company he worked and married to the owner's daughter. However, he soon learns that his alternate self's other decisions have a number of problems: his father is now divorced (on "his" advice, no less), he's having an affair with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> co-worker, his best friend is now afraid of him, he's been involved in some shady schemes with the other executives who are now plotting to get rid of him after noting his "change of heart" and his wife from the original timeline is now married to someone else.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum">Stargate Continuum</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ba'al</span> has gone back in time and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stopped the Stargate from reaching the United States in WWII, also killing Mitchell's great-grandfather, who was also transporting the Stargate to the US</span>. This is made more interesting when the main characters, who know about the normal timeline, ask to be allowed to fix things, only to be told by General Landry that the people in this timeline don't <em>want</em> to be involved in big intergalactic wars. They like things just fine the way they are.
</li><li> Perhaps the Aesop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LolaRennt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LolaRennt">Lola Rennt</a></em> is that it's all just a crapshoot. Any given ripple of influence from a chance event could be a Butterfly Of Doom â€” or a miraculous windfall â€” for Lola or anyone she brushes with. The opener alone establishes that fighting fate is just a game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FishStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FishStory">Fish Story</a></em> is one big butterfly effect, tracing from the initial recording of a before-its-time and rapidly forgotten musical number to how that particular bit of music sets in motion a chain of events that saves the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em>:
<ul><li> Invoked in the series â€” in that it is the machines' plan to alter their present by meddling with the past. Yet curiously averted in that they kill a whole bunch of people other than Sarah or John seemingly without affecting anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys">Terminator Genisys</a></em> brings this even further even by establishing the "crushed butterfly" that creates an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once John Connor undergoes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Unwilling Roboticisation</a> in the future, the history up to that point is altered.</span>

His teacher warns him about the possibility that something worse may happen in their place.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeChasers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeChasers">Time Chasers</a></em>, where a nerdy scientist invents a time machine, and then has to go back in time and prevent an earlier version of himself from giving it to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>.

<ul><li> The archetypal example â€” from which the trope name descends â€” would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s 1952 short story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASoundOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASoundOfThunder">A Sound of Thunder</a></em>. There is a "Time Safari" where you can go back in time and hunt any animal. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied Trope</a> here because they specifically look for animals who are going to die and go back in time to just before they do, and have an anti-gravity path to shoot the animal from. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naturally, something goes wrong: the cocky Eckels is scared as heck when he sees his T-Rex, and runs off the path. When they go back to the present, the Hitler-esque Deutscher wins the Presidential election instead of Keith. There is also a different alphabet. And all because, you guessed it, Eckels accidentally stepped on and killed a butterfly.</span> This is a Trope Namer; the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namers</a> drew inspiration from this one.
</li><li> Similarly, the science-fiction story "Aristotle and the Gun" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> has an arrogant time traveler trying to change history, and achieving the exact opposite of what he intends.
</li><li> Both the novel and the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Millennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Millennium">Millennium</a></em> conclude with a runway "timequake" obliterating the future, because of an accidental change made to the timeline in the present.
</li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> Super Special dealt with a villain changing time.

Much of the conflict of the book is over whether to restore the world or keep it the new way (in which Hitler was just a driver but the world appears to be a fascist nightmare with the Yeerks much closer to winning), and what justifies preserving bad pieces of history.
<ul><li> There was also another storyline where we find out what would have happened if the main characters hadn't run into the alien who gave them superpowers and warned them about an alien invasion.

In the end, only the destruction of the time agency itself allowed the restoration of mankind's original timeline: a life full of risks in search of the Unknown, but also with the potential to colonize the galaxy and survive into the distant future after the Earth's sun had gone nova.

</li></ul></li><li> This was subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>. When the faculty of the Unseen University find themselves trapped centuries or even millennia before they were born, Ponder Stibbons invokes the ever-popular "kill your own grandfather" example of why you shouldn't muck around with the past. Arch-chancellor Ridcully dismisses Ponder's concerns with a logical "whatever happens stays happened" attitude. He points out that having killed one's own grandfather and ceased to exist, no-one would exist to step on the ant, meaning your grandfather was never killed. This creates a circular paradox; doing something makes you unable to do it. He also observes that he is unlikely to kill his own grandfather, as he "rather liked the chap." Therefore, since they are in the past, they were clearly there once already (i.e. now), and therefore any ants that are stepped on, are vitally important in their capacity for being stepped on. The Bursar later attempts to take this to heart by jumping around on ants in between walking into trees.
<ul><li> This subversion of the Butterfly of Doom theory is itself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">well-respected alternate theory</a> of how time travel might work; in a real sense Ridcully is simply the Discworld inventor of an idea that many writers of time travel stories already accept in our world.
</li><li> Directly parodied with the Quantum Weather Butterfly, flocks of which played a big part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>. The Quantum Weather Butterfly uses its ability to affect localized weather phenomenon as a form of self-defense, and possibly a way of attracting mates. "Hey baby, look at this thunderstorm!" (And of course, Pratchett <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shows His Work</a> by pointing out that the fractal nature of the edge of the Quantum Weather Butterfly's wing makes it quite finite in area, but nearly infinite in perimeter, which is one of the seeming paradoxes of fractal surfaces in real life.)
<ul><li> Alas, no. While probably a deliberate 'error' attributed to Discworld logicians, the statement in the book is actually less mathematically sound:
<div class="indent">And therefore, if their edges are infinitely long, the wings must logically be infinitely big. <br/><br/>They may look about the right size for a butterfly's wings, but that's only because human beings have always preferred common sense to logic.

Lu-Tze, the history monk, muses on the nature of time:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lu-Tze:</strong> We're learning a lot, though! For a perfectly logical chain of reasons Vimes ended up back in time even <em>looking</em> rather like Keel!

After a rather huge misunderstanding because one character didn't get that last bit of info, they manage to let time go on its proper course.
<ul><li> And then, in the later books, Mark brings incredibly advanced technology into the past, jump-starting the computer industry and advancing technology's development. Of course, also thanks to Mark, we also get the future dystopia seen in <em>Raven Rise</em> because of a stupid decision he made in 1939.

</li><li> Alfred Bester's <em>The Men Who Murdered Mohammed</em> plays around with this. A scientist attempts to erase his wife's existence after he finds her cheating on him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear">The Wise Man's Fear</a></em> the Cthaeh, an entity unable to leave a single tree, has perfect knowledge of all possible futures, and whenever it speaks to someone, it manipulates them into causing the greatest possible harm with just a few words. Policy on handling those who speak to it is to shoot them dead from half a mile away, leave the body to decompose, and if a crow descends to eat the body, shoot the crow. And perhaps as a reference to the trope name, it spends its time setting up whatever little details it can so as to kill very specific butterflies that've come anywhere nearby.
</li><li> The historians in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis">Connie Willis</a>'s time-travel novels are afraid of this happening, because although for many years they've believed that the laws of time-travel physics don't allow anyone to travel if their presence will change history, this isn't borne out by their own experiences â€” while they can't visit "divergence points" (for example, the battle of Waterloo, or anywhere near Hitler) they <em>can</em> alter minor events, and then have no way of knowing whether this has had a significant effect. The plot of <em>To Say Nothing of the Dog</em> balances on whether two individuals will marry each other instead of the people that they're required to marry so that their descendants exist in the future in order to play historical roles. In <em>Blackout</em> it's posited that a novice time-traveler bumping into a woman and making her drop her handbag may cause the Allies to lose WWII. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, in both novels, the continuum appears either to self-correct, or to have "required" the presence of the time-travelers â€” in other words, the things they do have always happened and don't change the overall outcome of events.</span>
</li><li> In the short story "You're Another" a hapless man finds that all of his troubles are caused by people from the future who alter the past, over and over again, and then film it as entertainment. When asked if changing the past doesn't change their time in the future, they explain that it doesn't, saying "What happens to a dog when you cut off its mother's tail?" He is not happy when he finds out his part in all this, and why he's constantly falling into holes, having paint drop on him and being cheated on by his girlfriend. Their explanation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "comic relief"</span>.

While changing the past does have major negative effects, some of them are the result of the timestream shattering. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> For example, saving Kennedy leads to a massive Los Angeles earthquake <em>the same week</em>, which could not possibly have been a direct result.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeRiders">TimeRiders</a></em> is centred around stopping people from a seemingly hopeless future from changing the past. Only the odd book has no massive effect on the future due to something being changed in the past as its main plot.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> Back and Forth</em> is a brilliant example of this trope. In the story, Baldrick (accidentally, Blackadder meaning it as a scam to win a bet with his guests) invents a working time machine. They're sent on a dare to use it and to bring back a catalogue of different items including a centurion's helmet and the Duke of Wellington's boots. After Blackadder succeeds, it emerges that he has changed the course of history as a result: After finally arriving at the battle of Waterloo, he squashes the Duke of Wellington with his time machine just before the battle begins, steals his famous boots and causes the French to win the fight. As a result, Blackadder returns to an alternate-reality Britain which has been ruled by the French for 200 years â€” as a result of his tampering â€” following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory at Waterloo, and just in time for garlic pudding. He becomes especially disconcerted when he sees Archdeacon Darling wearing a tutu and exclaims "We've got to save Britain!" before going back in time to try and rectify everything. He also has a run-in with William Shakespeare, earlier on in the story, whom he attacks for the interminable suffering of school pupils that would happen for the next 400 years as a result of having to study his plays at length, leaving William completely discouraged as a playwright but dropping his ballpoint pen in the process. Later on, in the alternate reality, William Shakespeare is revealed to have been known only for "inventing the ballpoint pen." Eventually he learns to manipulate history consciously so he becomes the king in the present and marries Maid Marian.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> episode "Remedial Chaos Theory" is all about this. It's decided that a roll of the dice will dictate who has to leave and pick up a pizza, so the one rolling the dice will be creating six different universes, all based around what the characters would or (or in some cases, wouldn't) be doing in the two or three minutes that the pizza is getting picked up. All outcomes except for one involve the group somehow creating a conflict in these few minutes. In the real (best) outcome, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abed stops the dice from falling, Jeff goes to get the pizza, and the group gets along fine while he's gone.</span> In the "Dark" outcome <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Troy leaves to pick up the pizza, Pierce dies, Annie goes insane and Shirley becomes an alcoholic because of Pierce's death, Jeff loses an arm, and Troy loses his larynx.</span> Abed acknowledges that it's the darkest timeline, and makes everyone felt goatees so they can all be "evil" versions of themselves.

</li><li> The short-lived anthology series <em>Darkroom</em> had the story "Stay Tuned, We'll Be Right Back". A man discovers his old crystal radio can connect to World War II. He decides to save the life of his father who died in the war by sending a message into the past to cause the German U-Boat to avoid torpedoing that ship. He finds his father now alive and running a local store but the man is no longer married with a child. His dad then hands him an ID card with an eagle insignia. At that moment, a man in an SS uniform enters for an order. Looking on the street, the man sees figures in Nazi uniforms about and the newspaper talking of the future of the American Reich. The episode ends with him realizing his actions have somehow allowed the Axis to win World War II.

Donna asks the Doctor why he can't warn the city of the impending volcanic eruption, only for him to say that it's a fixed point in time that must not be tampered with. At the end, as the volcano is erupting, Donna pleads with the Doctor to help, so he rescues one family (the one they've gotten to know throughout the episode) and puts them outside of the city with what appears to be no consequences.
</li><li> While the show is mostly immune to this trope, with characters messing through time willy-nilly, it is used occasionally. The episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft">"Turn Left"</a> is probably the most striking example, with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a> twist.

To fix it, the Doctor has to take the Pandorica to the TARDIS and have it explode, sending all the atoms of the old universe everywhere in every point of time, effectively Big Bang 2, but he will be stuck on the other side of rip.

</li></ul></li><li> Comes up in several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season three's "...Different Destinations", the crew find themselves sent back in time by a freaking out Stark while visiting a monastery saved from destruction by Peacekeepers. In addition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a> for Aeryn when she learns the great hero of the battle turned out to merely be the company cook, the crew has to deal with an escalating series of alterations to the timeline with <em>catastrophic</em> implications for the future (including, at one point, the planet <em>ceasing to exist</em>) as they attempt to keep events on their historical course (Harvey having told John of the theory of time's elasticity, and that events steered near-enough to course will lead to time self-repairing). Eventually they set things more or less right and return home, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but the women and children who originally survived instead ended up being slaughtered in the "fixed" timeline, and the crew is unable to go back again to save them</span>.
</li><li> The danger of this is further highlighted by the Einstein in season four's "Terra Firma," warning that using a wormhole to travel to a point in time in one's universe <em>before</em> the time one departs can have disastrous consequences. The following episode, "Kansas", follows up on this when John accidentally travels to his own past and his arrival somehow changes time so his father is fated to fly the doomed <em>Challenger</em> mission. The crew manages to avoid making any major ripples as they trigger a series of events which Crichton recalls led to his father withdrawing from the mission (specifically shacking up as a teenager with Karen Shaw in the back of his dad's four-by<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oaix');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oaix" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oaix');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">actually Chiana in the back of John's truck, with Noranti using a bit of mind control to alter the exact memory</span> at an abandoned house, which caught fire and nearly killed him, only for his dad to rescue him and beg off the mission until he recovered).

But doing so creates a ripple effect so the long-missing Nightingale serial killer survives for another 20 years...and his new victims include Raimy's mother.
<ul><li> Raimy is thrown that her boyfriend Daniel no longer knows her. She realizes that in the original timeline, Daniel was a patient of Raimy's mother, Jules, when Raimy came by for a visit and they hit it off. In the new timeline, with Jules long missing, there was no reason for Raimy to go to the hospital that night and so she and Daniel never met.

<ul><li> A big part of the show, with time travel (mainly by Hiro Nakamura, and later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peter Petrelli</span>) and precognition being used to fix, worsen, and then repair the future many times.

It's stated that simply backstepping (going back in time one week) already changes the timeline because the Sphere materializes and changes air currents, causing airplanes to land a bit sooner/later and the like.

Things are spiraling out of control, precisely because the timeship is based on the idea of <em>Laplace's Demon</em> which is contradicted by both Quantum Mechanics and Chaos Theory. He keeps erasing <em>entire species</em> from existence to restore his species to their former glory, only for unanticipated consequences (one species introduced antibodies that saved his from being decimated by a plague, another prevented some other species from conquering them, etc.) to leave his species still weak or actually worse off. In the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the original timeline can only be restored by destruction of the timeship (which had existed "outside time" while aboard centuries of subjective time passed), which Captain Janeway brings about by ramming it with the <em>Voyager</em>, destroying both ships in the process and "resetting" the timeline back one year.</span>

They stop two Godzilla-esque monsters from attacking each other and cause the Vietnam War. After preventing 9/11, one of the character's sister starts to disappear from a picture (a parody of <em>Back to the Future</em>). In response, they scream "We have go back and save 9/11!"

<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em>, where the universe actively <em>resists</em> attempts to change it. To illustrate it, the sourcebook gives the classic example of a man going back in time to kill his own grandfather. If Johnny Fong goes back in time and kills his grandfather, he returns to the present to find that his name is Johnny <em>Wong</em> now, but nothing else has changed. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em>, world history bows to the whims of the people in control of the world's feng shui sites, and anything done by insignificant time travelers just gets corrected.
</li><li> One particular incident which was a footnote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, Ork warlord Grizgutz lead his Waaagh! off to war the course of it brings him back home. Because FTL travel for most relies on going into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a>, which has at best an orthogonal relationship to physics in realspace, he arrives home before he left to go to war. He then did what he felt was reasonable (for an Ork), he decided to kill his doppleganger to have a spare of his favorite gun. The resulting confusion made the Waaagh! stop in its tracks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum">Continuum</a></em> averts this in a weird way. Time travelers come in two factions; Narcissists who want to use time travel to change history, and the Continuum which wants to keep things just as they are. The war between the two has a known ending; the Continuum wins. The Continuum must win, because if the Narcissists keep changing the past, existence vanishes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">Puff of Logic</a>. All existence. Thus, for the good of everyone ever born, there are no butterlies of doom. Not "the Continuum must stop them or existence will blink out." Rather, the butterflies at no point in the time stream happen, and this is known because existence still exists. That doesn't mean Narcissists won't try to change things (they believe existence can change) or that things happened the way you think they did.
<ul><li> If a Narcissist has a plan to insert a butterfly of doom, it fails. Of course, since you might not know what that plan is, you don't know exactly how history unfolded. For example, if a Narcissist tries to go back in time to stop Lincoln's assassination, it's entirely possible the narcissist killed John Wilkes Boothe - and a member of the Continuum replaced him.
<ul><li> The Continuum operates by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>; since everyone, everywhere, at all times winks out if the timeline is damaged, ensuring even the most horrible events in history play out as recorded is paramount. Put another way, the Continuum would defend Pol Pot because letting Pol Pot be stopped - contradictory to the historical record - causes <em>all existence</em> to stop, ending <em>countless</em> lives.

For example, by sending units back in time to fight alongside themselves, if the original units are damaged in the ensuing battle, the future versions will be also damaged when the next timewave comes by. Eventually, this can resolve into a much weaker army than was originally used. Also, these sorts of time-manipulation tricks can allow for armies to go back to attack economic or production structures to disrupt opponents. For example, killing <em>that one marine</em> who built all the resource processors that made the construction of the army that's harassing you in the future even possible.

In a nutshell, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Crono and friends defeat Lavos and create a good future, Lavos in the past - in an attempt to avert its own destruction - pulls a supercomputer called FATE from the newly created future back in time, to fight with an organic computer that the planet has called in from an alternate future where Lavos never landed on the planet. FATE wins and, in an attempt to make sure that its current existence doesn't prevent its future creation and, thus, create a time paradox, it starts guiding human events to make sure everything happens according to plan. The Lavos that was defeated by Crono, meanwhile, has merged with Schala and formed into a being that is attempting to devour all of spacetime. Schala, for reasons that aren't really clear, winds up altering spacetime herself in order to save an infant Serge from a panther demon, causing Serge to mess up FATE's plan and suddenly become the centrepiece to approximately two dozen people's schemes for saving, destroying, or conquering the world.</span> Basically, Crono altering the future by killing Lavos causes a dozen or so beings with the ability to manipulate time to immediately launch into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">an elaborate web of overlapping gambit schemes</a> to try and ensure that the new future does or does not come to pass. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">And that's the ''short'' version!</a>

<ul><li> Universes 1 and 10 had the Kaioshin eradicate every threat they found. Freeza being dead, the Saiyans never had a technology or power boost and never became space pirates.
</li><li> Universe 3 diverged when Bardock put to good use his prophetic visions and managed to take Freeza down, with Saiyans taking over the galaxy, Kakarot never being sent to Earth, and then Raichi taking revenge on the Saiyans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Piccolo Daimao also fused with Kami, through yet unknown circumstances, with an evil Piccolo being the dominant personality.</span>
</li><li> Universe 4 diverged when Majin Buu opted to quickly absorb Vegeta when he threatened to remove Fat Buu from his cocoon rather than plead with him. Goku is then forced to fight on his own, where he is horribly outclassed; even his Hail-Mary of expending his full power to blow Buu up failed miserably and Buu simply absorbed him as well.
</li><li> Universe 6 diverged when Goku did not warp back to Earth to save Gohan against Bojack and give him a pep talk.
</li><li> Universe 7 diverged when all the Nameks decided to fuse into one being to take down Freeza, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> losing forever the ability to create Dragonballs in the process</span>.
</li><li> Universe 8, where Freeza and his family won, came about because Krilin killed Vegeta on Earth before Goku could stop him. Since Vegeta doesn't show up on Namek, he's not around to provide an extra distraction to Freeza or his henchmen, which eventually culminates in Freeza killing everyone on Namek (except Goku, which remained alive to destroy Freeza's capital).
</li><li> Universe 13, where Kakarot never hit his head and thus never lost his Saiyan mentality. So, instead of him becoming the cheerful and kindhearted man in canon, he becomes a ruthless killer who is more than a little mentally unbalanced. It goes without saying that humanity isn't around in U13 anymore.
</li><li> Universe 14 diverged when Trunks never came back to the future after his U17 counterpart got killed by Cell, thus ensuring the cyborgs could have free reign.
</li><li> Universe 16 diverged when Vegito made the choice to not remove his shield aura effect when inside Boo, and remained fused forever, freeing everyone and destroying Kid Boo before he could destroy the Earth. Also, Enma did not listen to his request to reincarnate him into Oob, so in this universe there is no Boo.
</li><li> Universe 17 diverged when Vegeta did not strike Cell in the back and distract him. This allowed Cell to overpower SSJ2 Gohan.
</li><li> Universe 19 diverged when Raditz killed Goku on Earth, according to the french novelization. This led to them attacking Helior with reduced numbers, and Helior probably weathered the assault, and stepped up their game.

Bush to lose his reelection for U.S. President in 2004, which motivates him to have all the southern states secede from the rest of the country and declare a second civil war, but with nukes being used and causing the death of over a <em>million</em> people. Whoops. The duo go back in time again to fix the mess, only for Brian to do more dumb things like giving his past self the idea to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>. Stewie eventually decides to go back to the very point where their past selves first time traveled and he shoots Brian in the kneecaps while screaming at him and his past self to go back home. Current Brian realizes that doing this will erase their existence since the time traveling shenanigans would have never happened. Naturally, the two of them disappear while the original Stewie and Brian are back in their own time with Peter and his drinking buddies from the pilot episode showing up in the same crudely drawn animations.

When Professor Farnsworth finds out that Fry's grandfather is there, he gives him the classic advice for people going back in time: "Don't do anything that will change history. Unless you're <em>supposed</em> to do it, in which case, for the love of God, don't <em>not</em> do it." Of course he does by killing his grandfather but the effects are minimal because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he realizes that he is not vanishing, so his grandfather can't really be his ancestor. However, he takes the extra step of thinking this disqualifies his grandmother from being his grandmother and sleeps with her, inadvertently <em>becoming</em> his own grandfather</span>. Farnsworth gets fed up after this incident and decides to just attack Roswell and steal their ship back. "Screw history! Let's just get the hell out of here!" When that plan actually <em>works</em>, the Professor triumphantly shouts "Choke on THAT, causality!"

There's even mention of a failsafe in the universe itself that erases impossibilities created by time travel, like the same person meeting themselves, that prevents the butterfly effect from having a dangerous effect. It comes up again in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS6E7TheLatePhillipJFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS6E7TheLatePhillipJFry">The Late Phillip J.

Zim, of course, plans to do just that to get rid of Dib, but his attempts to destroy Dib's younger self eventually go from 'make him more decrepit' to 'gives him more super weapons from the professor.'

While there, she constantly tells Happy not to touch anything. When she ends up angering a trio of dinosaurs, Bessie is forced to return to the present without Happy (but ends up taking the dinosaurs with her). While she's gone, Happy decides to indulge himself until she gets back. Upon returning to the present, they find that dogs have become the dominate species on the planet.

Twilight constantly goes back to stop her, but each time she does so, it just creates a worse and worse future - One where King Sombra conquers Equestria, one with the Changelings in charge, then Nightmare Moon, Tirek, Discord, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the Flim Flam Brothers</a></em>, then ultimately nothing but a barren wasteland.

This allowed Doofenshmirtz to ride the wave of hysteria and take over the Tri-State Area, turning it into a ruined industrial dystopia where fun and creativity are outlawed, kids are kept in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars">People Jars</a> until they reach adulthood, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">everyone is forced to change their name to "Joe"</a>.
