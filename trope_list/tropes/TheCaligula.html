Worse, every so often the throne is inherited by someone completely out of their gourd. Maybe it's the fault of that lead-lined plumbing, or those mercury-laced medicinal elixirs, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">maybe it's genetic</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">in which case you're in some deep trouble</a>). Whatever the cause, the sovereign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IControlMyMinionsThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IControlMyMinionsThrough">is still given the full power and support of the state</a> despite their obvious insanity, with inevitably disastrous consequences.
</p><p>The Caligula will be wildly irrational, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">violently moody</a>, extremely debauched, will never tolerate being told anything they dont want to hear, and are probably afflicted with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god complex</a>. In short, they will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> with the power of life or death over everyone whom they can reach. They may be a sexual deviant, or they might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">take pleasure in the pain and suffering they cause</a>. They may indulge in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">renaming cities or even the entire country after themself</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyLaws">throwing out increasingly ridiculous decrees</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">with brutal punishments in store for anyone who breaks them</a>. Whatever form the madness takes, one thing is certain: to do anything the Caligula finds displeasing is to inevitably be dragged off to a grisly death or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">worse</a>. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">any number of things might trigger their rage</a>, and they might even decide on a whim to punish those who have not done anything at all. And while all of this is going on, the land over which the Caligula rules is rapidly going down the drain due to their neglect. Here, in particular, they have a decided advantage over most other crackpots when it comes to messing things up: they can start wars. Be it for the perceived personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">glory</a> or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">obsession with perceived enemies</a>, the Caligula's country will probably be in a constant state of war.

Nobody within reach is safe from them, whether they be nobles, servants, bureaucrats, foreign ambassadors, or even members of their own family. The Caligula is very definitely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>. With any luck, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, a conspiracy will eventually develop to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">remove the crazy sovereign from his post... permanently</a>.
</p><p>This is not limited to sovereign heads of state. The Caligula can be anyone wielding great power within an organization while being completely nuts. Modern psychology has shown that the corporate business structure, if emphasizing financial profit to the detriment of anything else, can be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Snakes-Suits-When-Psychopaths-ebook/dp/B000QUCOAS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1282609408&amp;sr=8-3">especially prone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the appearances of individuals displaying at least a majority if not all of The Caligula's traits (so long as the person seeking profits is a psychopath, which is what the book seems to be saying.)

His first scenes involve strangling his cat when it upsets him, and then having the child protagonist tortured for hours and hours on end.
</li><li> The World Government of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> appears to fall into this, although not the Marines protecting it. The World Government itself is incredibly corrupt and brutal, being major patrons of the mostly pirate-run slave trade and using the Marines for acts of mass butchery to silence those that found out their dirty secrets or could threaten them. The "nobility" of this world is even worse, as the upper-middle class will cheerfully burn an occupied city to the ground to make things look neater for a World Noble's visit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">claim it's the poor people's fault</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">for being too stupid to be born nobles</a>.

<ul><li> For reference, when the Straw Hats went to rescue Hachi's mermaid friend from being sold into slavery, one of the "nobles" decided to shoot random people for no reason other than the thought occurred to him. And everyone — meaning everyone, including the people who normally wouldn't stand for such insanity — were shocked beyond words when Luffy punched the bastard in the face.
</li><li> Villains who actually <em>work</em> for them is a case-by-case basis. For example, most of the antagonists in the Impel Down arc are just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> and sadistic as any noble, with the notable exception of Magellan, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc; he was the closest anyone in the prison came to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>, despite being loyal to his employers.
</li><li> Spandam is certainly this to the CP9 and everyone at Enies Lobby. Despite being weaker than Coby when Luffy first met him, he somehow got to be the leader of a major Marines stronghold and treats everyone, subordinate and pirate alike, like they were gum on the bottom of his shoe in addition to reveling in his power to make the Buster Call, even after accidentally making it. What really sealed it, though, was telling everyone over the loudspeaker his plan to leave them all to be destroyed by the Buster Call while he hightailed it to a safe distance.
</li><li> Were he to achieve his goal of taking over Fishman Island, Hody Jones would easily be this - his immediate plans would be to slaughter anyone on the island who wants to live in peace with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">humans</a>, followed by going to a council of kings with the intended purpose of murdering them all.

She has everyone who lives in her kingdom pay pieces of their SOULS (effectively reducing their lifespan) so she can put them into inanimate objects and bring them to life as her homies, threatens people by saying she'll chop off a loved one's head and send it to them in a box, holds extravagant tea parties where she plans to kill certain guests and have everybody dance on their corpses and eat cake.

<ul><li> The 1994 story "The Great Pretender" (the first in a miniseries of <em>Showcase</em> issues each featuring a different <em>Batman</em> villain) shows us an alternate Gotham City in which the Joker has apparently taken over everything and crowned himself "King." In addition to his usual cold-blooded murders, King Joker makes his subjects take baths in custard, has all government employees dress in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedOutfit">Elizabethan-era costumes</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">broadcasts his decrees via giant video screens towering over the streets of Gotham</a>. And as if all that wasn't wild enough, there are numerous crazed men running around in white makeup and green hair dye who seek to overthrow King Joker, including an amnesiac who believes he <em>is</em> the Joker. Plus, various Batman impostors are also roaming the streets to do battle with all these faux Jokers. Yeah, it gets pretty crazy.

Numedides regularly had men and women flayed alive for minor transgressions; indeed, when Conan was imprisoned in his tower, Numedides executed a dancer who Conan liked and ordered a scrap of her flesh tossed in Conan's cell. Conan immediately recognized who it belonged to because of the dancer's many tattoos.

In a slight variation, his father tried to avert it by naming one of his more level-headed brothers the next king, but Long kills his brother and takes the throne anyway.

The Animorphs often conspire to keep him in charge of the invasion, as his leadership makes the Yeerks less effective.

</li><li> King Joffrey Baratheon's reckless, childish cruelty and love of ordering executions result in a continent-wide civil war.

Thankfully, his siblings Tommen and Myrcella have shown no signs of following his path despite identical lineage.
</li><li> Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">the whole Targaryen dynasty</a> had this trope going on multiple times along the way, to the point that a saying went that when Targaryens were born the gods flipped a coin: half of them were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">good or competent rulers</a> and the other half were Caligulas, with Aerys merely being the one who took it too far. Of Aerys' children, his son Rhaegar and daughter Daenerys are of questionable sanity, while his other son Viserys was the next Caligula-to-be. The dynastic tradition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> might have had something to do with this, to the point that Daenerys' great-grandfather (who married a non-Targaryen) intended to end this practice and was quite displeased when his children copied his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a> decision but married <em>each other</em> and then forced their own children, the aforementioned Aerys and Rhaella, into this themselves.

Not <em>quite</em> as bad as her son when it comes to the pointlessly petty bonkers though (not like that's particularly hard). Although... she is currently being far more effective at ruling spectacularly badly, mainly thanks to being a drunk, spoiled and narcissistic <em>adult</em> on the throne.
</li><li> He's not the king, but Robert Arryn, a six-year-old who still literally suckles his mother's teat and likes to watch "<em>bad men fly</em>" (people he doesn't like being thrown from the top of his mountain keep), is the hereditary heir to the title of Lord of the Vale and Warden of the East, essentially putting the keeping of one fourth of the kingdom in his care. And now he's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Littlefinger</a> as his chief counselor...although it seems that Littlefinger has made him <em>less</em> of a brat, teaching him to respect his inferiors at least a <em>little</em> bit.

How decadent? He made Sanguine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Debauchery</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">Hedonism</a>, so uncomfortable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">that he left Reman</a></em>. However, unlike many examples of the trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Reman was also an incredibly skilled and successful leader</a>. Starting as something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a>, Reman first reunited the two halves of Cyrodiil (Colovia and Nibenay), and then the other kingdoms of Men (High Rock and Skyrim). Later, he successfully defeated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Akaviri</a> invaders and absorbed the survivors into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">fledgling proto-empire</a>, where they would serve him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CadreOfForeignBodyguards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CadreOfForeignBodyguards">a foreign</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>. Though Imperial dogma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade">typically leaves out or whitewashes his negative traits</a>, he is (justifiably) remembered as one of the greatest rulers in Cyrodiilic history.
</li><li> Another backstory example is Emperor Pelagius the Mad. Born Thoriz Pelagius Septim, he briefly ruled the Third Tamriellic Empire from 3E 145 to 3E 153. Infamous for his eccentricities, he certainly lived up to his nickname. He suffered from extreme weight and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">mood</a> fluctuations, and tried to hang himself at the end of a royal ball. He insisted on his palace always being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak">kept clean</a> and (perhaps apocryphally) was said to defecate on the floors to keep his servants busy. He would only communicate with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonian</a> ambassador in grunts and squeaks, believing it to be the Argonian language. He'd frequently strip naked in public and, toward the end of his life, would attack and bite visitors. After his madness became too publicly apparent, he was declared unfit to rule and his wife by arranged marriage, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Dunmeri</a> former Duchess of Vvardenfell, Katariah, took over as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Empress Regent</a>, as the only non-human to rule the Third Empire (the plan when the marriage was arranged was for Katariah to act as a stable, competent power behind the throne to keep things running, but after Pelagius inherited the throne his madness soon grew out of control). Pelagius was institutionalized and died only a few years later, but his legacy as the Mad Emperor lives on.
</li><li> This also applies to Sheogorath, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Madness</a>.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prince Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, heir to the Kingdom of Faerghus, while not King yet, is a rare example of a protagonist Caligula in the making. For most of the Academy phase, Dimitri starts off with personality traits similar to classic <em>Fire Emblem</em> lords like Marth, being a compassionate young man with an aversion to violence that wants to reform Fodlan through acceptance. However, he is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of a royal massacre that included his father and stepmother, which was later followed up by a genocide against the people of Duscur, who were wrongly accused of said massacre. As a result, Dimitri suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a> and frequently has hallucinations of the Tragedy's victims, whom he perceives are demanding the heads of those truly responsible, and has episodes of sadism when confronting those he believes were involved. When he learns that his stepsister Edelgard (and one of his only remaining family) is the Flame Emperor (whom he erroneously thinks was involved in the Tragedy of Duscur), he completely snaps and becomes obsessed with taking her head. Five years later on story routes outside Crimson Flower and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">spending those five years in isolation as a fugitive</a>, he's still violently unhinged and murdering Imperial soldiers left and right, with people comparing him to a beast. What little resistance against the Adrestian Empire there is in the Kingdom tries to rally behind Dimitri, but he neglects morale among his own troops and the people suffering in the Kingdom in favor of trying to appease the dead, even making death threats towards those questioning his goals. On Azure Moon (his own story route), his own allies are questioning if he's mentally competent enough to be leading the fight against the Empire, let alone be the next king, and only follow him because they're fighting for the Kingdom or have mutual enmity towards the Empire (some of those in the latter category try to distance themselves from Dimitri). Dimitri only steers away from this dark path and goes on to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good King</a> when he realizes that he's only perpetuating an endless cycle of revenge, and only after one of his closest allies dies from a revenge-driven assassination attempt meant for him.

However, Archbishop Rhea (who is actually Saint Seiros going by another name to hide that she's long-lived and not human, and otherwise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> at the start of the game and on other story routes, albeit one with questionable methods and motives and not entirely trusting humans) goes through it instead after Byleth — whom she had been treating as a vessel for her mother, Sothis — chooses Edelgard over her, perceiving it as a betrayal and declares them both heretics against the Church of Seiros. While the Church isn't an official nation in Fodlan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">it still has its own army and a lot of political influence throughout Fodlan's culture</a>, and is a recognized authority in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Faerghus</a>. As the story progresses, former Church clergy and even her closest advisor Seteth become increasingly worried about her declining sanity and her obsession with reuniting with her mother, to the point that Seteth and his daughter Flayn flee from Fodlan if the Black Eagle Strike Force spares them in battle. After Dimitri is killed on the Tailtean Plains and the Empire makes their advance on the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad, she becomes the Kingdom's regent and leads its remaining soldiers. Shortly after taking command, Rhea orders the capital to be set aflame in an unhinged attempt to take out all of her enemies (who actually offered for her to surrender) despite the Kingdom's loyalty to the Church since its founding, and during the final battle, rants about how untrustworthy humans are. However, Verdant Wind reveals that her mother and siblings were massacred by Nemesis and the Ten Elites, and their remains were used to create the Crest Stones and Heroes' Relics. The attack on the Holy Tomb was seen as a mass grave defilement against her family, and Byleth (who was chosen to not only to be a vessel for Sothis, but also bear her respective Crest Stone and Hero's Relic) joining with Edelgard was pouring salt on the wound.</span>

As the second-born, he was not expected to inherit but did so anyway by murdering first his brother and then his father. Drought and high taxes left the people impoverished and on the verge of starvation while Thorn hosted sumptuous feasts for his courtiers. He fed people to animals for his own amusement, chopped off both hands of anyone suspected of theft, executed anyone who spoke against him, and on at least one occasion had an entire village's population skinned alive. Of his eight wives, he killed at least four personally. Thorn's reign came to an abrupt end when an enraged mob stormed the castle and murdered him. After being very "creative" with his body, it was dismembered and sealed in several boxes which were hidden through Kryta for fear he might one day return.

Oswald found out and had his son sealed in a sarcophagus with the intention of releasing him once he'd learned his lesson, only for the mob riled up by Edrick to storm the castle. Oswald left Edrick sealed away and had all references to his name erased from the library as a final insult.

</li><li> The Prophet of Regret is hot-headed, stubborn, and impetuous; the only thing he <em>ever</em> regrets is being blackmailed by the Prophet of Truth.
</li><li> The Prophet of Mercy is a merciless fanatic who himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up being shown no mercy by Truth</span>.

Once he succeeded the Neo Arcadia throne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after sabotaging Copy X Mk.

It got so bad that in Zero 4, some human refugees (who were brave enough) fled from Neo Arcadia to get away from him, and Weil retaliated by attempting to destroy Area Zero, - the only other habitable place left on Earth - forcing all humans to live under his oppression. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, Craft, realized how insane he was that he fired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Ragnarok</a> on Neo Arcadia in a (failed) attempt to kill Weil.</span>

He cares about nothing but holding absolute power, driven by an ambition based solely on ego and a lust for conquest and power. He even promoted infighting and competition amongst his minions in a "divide and rule" policy to the point where the Centaur and Shokan races went to war with one another to curry his favor (and thus gain more power), and as long as he holds absolute power he doesn't really care about laws beyond "what Shao Kahn feels like" and how his people live their day to day lives, though it tends to be pretty miserable, desperate and violent thanks to how sadistic and brutish he is.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhNoItsAnAlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhNoItsAnAlienInvasion">Oh No! It's An Alien Invasion</a></em>: Emperor Brainlius III is a big fat childish guy more interested in playing around than leading.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero">Nero</a> himself appeared on Peabody and Sherman's segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>, but this was a subversion, where he was portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood">Not Evil, Just Misunderstood</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In this reality, it was actually Nero's <em>music teacher</em> who started the fire</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero">Nero</a> appears in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, where Garfield tells the story of the cat who invented lasagna. In the story, Nero is depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton">Villainous Glutton</a> who imprisons (or in some cases, executes) bad chefs. When the cat's owner (the cat and the owner being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expys</a> of Garfield and Jon) is thrown in prison, the cat appeals to the Emperor's appetite, claiming Jon is an excellent chef (even though he isn't) which persuades the Emperor to give him a chance. The cat's idea is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">cats and emperors are very much alike</a>, lazy, greedy people who like to be waited on, so he figured the Emperor would like what <em>he</em> likes, and directs his owner to make what is eventually called lasagna. It works; the Emperor loves it and pardons the man.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> special "Whatever Happened to SpongeBob?" has an amnesiac SpongeBob finding himself in a city under the tyranny of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaserDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaserDelinquents">greaser gang</a> who outlawed bubbles just because they have the potential to cause harm. In the end, they turn out to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> when the city (somehow) collapses into chaos only a few hours after SpongeBob's bubble laws were put into practice.
</li><li> Galvatron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>. Spending the time between the movie and season three in a lava pit turned him from the Megatron-but-competent of the movie to... uh... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">the way we all remember him being</a>. He blasted more of his own troops in his rages than Autobots in battle, and at one point, some other Decepticons told his right-hand bot Cyclonus that if something didn't change, they were going to deal with <em>both</em> of them. Too bad no Decepticon civil war ever materialized.
<ul><li> Straxus from the comics is even worse. His Animated counterpart, however, is played for laughs on a fan-run <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog">formspring</a> page.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingRollo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingRollo">King Rollo</a></em> is a benign, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example. He never does anything malicious — in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">he never does anything at all</a> besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">play with his toys</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyWalk">move from place to place in a silly manner</a>. The show's very young target audience doesn't need to concern itself with the effect Rollo's reign has on his kingdom, but older viewers are free to infer what they will.
</li><li> The Czar of Balzac from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> episode "The Emperor's New Joe" was obsessed with making his tiny nation trendy, no matter how ridiculous this made his citizens.
</li><li> Princess Boo-Boo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freaktown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freaktown">Freaktown</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">bratty</a>, bossy ruler of Sweetlandia who wants to make Freaktown as cutesy and saccharine as the rest of her domain.

In reality, she was a total lunatic whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">hatred of monsters</a> reached psychotic levels. She created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">an army of horrific mutants</a> to aid in her crusades and tried to create a spell called Annihilation, which wouldve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">killed every single monster in existence</a>. Fortunately, she died before she could complete it, and her daughter Eclipsa was sane enough to make sure it <em>stayed</em> incomplete.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>: Catra's rank in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Horde</a> seems to be inversely proportional with her sanity and ability to be at all reasonable. By Season 4, she's an equal partner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Hordak himself</a>... and has also developed a nasty habit of lashing out and verbally abusing people for disagreeing with her, forcing her underlings to work three shifts back-to-back without a chance to sleep, keeping everyone in the dark about her plans, and making some <em>very</em> damaging decisions in her effort to finally outdo Adora, up to and including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearly ending the world, and exiling Entrapta — <em>Hordak's almost-girlfriend</em> — to Beast Island when she tries to interfere. This all blows up in her face by the end of the season; thanks to her actions, many of her soldiers have lost all confidence in her, she causes at <em>least</em> five people defect from the Horde, two of whom were her most useful allies, and Hordak finds out what she did to Entrapta and goes <em>ballistic</em>.</span>
