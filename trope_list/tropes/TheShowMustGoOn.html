Sometimes, a catastrophe occurs during the production of a creative work that forces it to a halt - the writer quits, the union goes on strike, or an actor gets injured or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">suffers critical existence failure.</a> In recorded works intended for later consumption, this can be remedied relatively easily - scenes can be rewritten or reshot, actors can be replaced, shooting can be put on hiatus.
</p><p>However, in live entertainment, the show must go on at all costs - unlike with a movie or a TV show, a live performance has an audience of potentially <em>tens of thousands</em> of people, who have all <em>paid</em> to be there, and are rightfully expecting to get their money's worth. This forces the characters into crazy improvisations, costume changes, awkward stealth to avoid further disrupting the show and any number of desperate things to keep the show going.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It must also be remembered that for live entertainers, not only is it about making sure people get their money's worth or ensuring a production continues, <em>performing is something they've dedicated their lives to.</em> It's not something they do, it's who they are, and it's a point of professional pride that no matter what, the show must go on. Even for those who take a less high-minded view, they are <em>professionals</em> after all— meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">if the show doesn't go on, nobody gets their paycheck</a>.
</p><p>Note that the full phrase is something like "the show must go on tonight" (i.e. whatever personal tragedy happens during the day, everyone must be in place and ready to perform when the curtain rises).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> Minmay wanted to interrupt a concert due a sudden Zentraedi attack (that, unbeknownst to her, had actually boarded the ship), but Kaifun convinced her to continue to prevent the fans from panicking... And, she continued <em>even when a group of battlepods showed up and stopped to listen to her concert</em> (she <em>did</em> stop for a moment in shock when they appeared, but as soon as she saw they were just standing there she resumed singing). It wasn't until more combative Zentraedi endangered the public that she stopped her concert.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, the stunt extra aerobatic team messes up at Sheryl Nome's concert, causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Alto</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">knock Sheryl off her several story high stage</a>. Alto manages to recover and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAFallingStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAFallingStar">catch her</a>, saving her from a fatal fall. Her reaction? Annoyance, and she tells him to get flying and make it look good while she continues singing, because the show must go on.
<ul><li> Later in the same concert, an air raid siren sounds ushering everyone to the nearest shelter. Sheryl's reaction: "But I'm not finished singing yet!" The trope is subverted, as Cathy drags her off stage.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>, there was a play called "The Mermaid Princess", which is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>", took place in the school. Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Lucia's</a> clumsiness, and a (real) attack from the water demons, the show continued thanks to Rina's quick wit in ad libs. Since part of the ad lib involved the main trio transforming and making a performance (driving away the water demons), the rest of the play had to be improvised.
</li><li> Thanks to this trope, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> universe it is assumed that anything that occurs on stage while a play is being performed is part of the play. That includes spontaneous script rewrites, duels with real swords, and massive explosions. Lina and Co. got an award for their ad-libbed play (which, while completely nonsensical, was much more entertaining than the original story they intended to perform).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> manga, during Turnabout Showtime, after Flip Chambers, who plays Twinklestar in the Sparklestar show for Sparkle Land, is stabbed inside his costume, he comes out on stage as scheduled before collapsing and dying. Toward the end of the trial, Phoenix speculates that "Maybe he thought the show must go on. Or maybe he was asking for help."
</li><li> Similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em> had an incident early on. Urara is chosen to be the MC for a kid's play, but it turns out that the actress playing the rabbit fell ill. Nozomi, not wanting her friend's big day ruined, takes up the role of the rabbit... despite Rin pointing out that she was <em>banned</em> from the Drama Club after only 3 days in. Despite this, they go with it and things start out alright... only for Girinma to arrive and summon the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>. The girls are able to blind most everyone to transform and the audience is treated to a Pretty Cure fight... which is a big hit with the crowds. When Urara's manager approaches Urara once more and wants the same thing to happen, the poor girl's left in a bind, while her friends tell the audience their answer.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nozomi, Rin, Komachi and Karen:</strong> Not going to happen.
</div></li><li> It's SprouT's first live concert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheIdolmaster2TheWorldIsAllOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheIdolmaster2TheWorldIsAllOne">The iDOLM@STER 2: The World Is All One!!</a></em>, and halfway through the lights all go out. The girl's begin to panic but Azusa of fellow idol unit Ryuuguu Komachi immediately begins singing by herself to calm the audience down, followed by the rest of her unit putting on an improved show until everything can get fixed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce">SD Gundam Force</a></em>, this is the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Zako Zako Hour</a> is being held even though the <em>Gundamusai</em> is being pulled into a crack in the Minov Boundary Sea. The lead host even names this trope.
</li><li> This trope is pretty much Rise's motivational speech when preparing for the concert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4GoldenTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4GoldenTheAnimation">Persona 4 Golden: The Animation</a></em> when she says that a real pro will always arrive to perform, no matter what. And, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though she ends up arriving late to the show, Marie takes her words to heart and sings vocals until Rise makes it and they sing together</span>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders">Spider Riders</a></em>, Hunter Steele, Shadow and the Spider Riders end up staring in a play about a legendary hero. Due to a misunderstanding, the villain Grasshop assumed that Hunter and the others would only be observing the play. So he attempted to ambush the heroes, while they were right in the middle of preforming. Hunter decided to stay in character, so he improvised and the play continued.

Then the mob, who are after Krusty, throw a stick of dynamite through the window. Homer quickly covers the dynamite with a pot and <em>sits on it</em>.

The show went to series with Gordon Elliott as host, but he got fired over a salary dispute, so Lynn Swann moved from the celebrity panel to the host's seat. However, Swann often had schedule conflicts, so he quit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek">Alex Trebek</a> of <em>Jeopardy!</em> fame took over.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration">Concentration</a></em> was originally live on NBC, so whenever the board malfunctioned, the host had to do something to stall for time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Norm Blumenthal</a>, the producer even said that if a light blew, a tech would appear on camera with a ladder and repair it with no stoppage of tape (when the show went to tape) and he'd pop for the tech's appearance.

<ul><li> The February 16, 1998 episode had one contestant, Scott, accidentally trip while walking onstage. But after losing his pricing game, he jumped in disappointment only to sprain his knee and couldn't stand up.

</li><li> A later episode with Drew Carey had a contestant who injured her leg during the Showcase Showdown. During the Showcase, she was given a chair to sit in. She didn't win, but Drew not only stayed with her post-reveal, he also made sure a doctor was called to tend to her injury.
</li><li> On the original show with Bill Cullen, the tote screens in front of the contestants would go crazy sometimes, showing some weird displays. Sometimes the tote screens would be out of order altogether so the models would write the contestants' bids on giant sketch pads behind them. Frozen bids were circled.
</li></ul></li><li> In the sixth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a>'s</em> second season, Buck Henry and John Belushi were doing a sketch entitled "Samurai Stockbroker." Belushi's samurai sword was <em>not</em> a blunt prop but rather was an authentically sharp weapon. Henry was standing too close to Belushi when the latter was slashing at a wall, and Henry's forehead was opened up to the bone. Rather than stop the show, Henry stayed in character and finished the sketch, and later appeared in the show with a bandage over the wound.
<ul><li> In fact, the entire cast wore bandaids on their foreheads for the rest of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Australian series <em>Police Rescue</em>, a theatre group convinces the Police Rescue Squad to quietly retrieve an injured backstage crewmember on the lighting catwalk. The crewmember is also hiding the extent of his injuries. They have a reason for this, as a theatre critic is watching and they're worried if his review of their play is too harsh, the government will cancel their upcoming funding.
</li><li> Due to budget and time constraints, the Classic era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> is riddled with this, with individual mishaps ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a> flubbing his lines to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> breaking his shoulder to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a> burning his back while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnflinchingWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnflinchingWalk">walking away from an explosion</a>.
<ul><li> Re-takes in the 1960s were extremely rare. William Hartnell's advice to his co-stars was to swear if they wanted to force the director to start again. Which likely explains the existence of rather foul-mouthed bloopers involving some of his successors.
</li></ul></li><li> British television channel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a> Play went on with the premiere of its topical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInGameShows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInGameShows">phone-in quiz show</a> <em>The Debbie King Show</em>, even though it was announced earlier in the day that the channel would be "suspended" (in reality, it was shut down permanently) as part of an audit over the broadcaster's use of premium-rate phone lines. It ended up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneEpisodeWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneEpisodeWonder">One-Episode Wonder</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a></em>: In "Midnight at the Concord," Midge gets a gig booked at the Concord Resort Hotel. Midway through her gig, she's thrown off-guard by spotting her father in the audience. After a few moments of freezing up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeerInTheHeadlights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeerInTheHeadlights">Deer in the Headlights</a>, she pulls herself together enough to power through the rest of her set.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> had a minor example in an episode where they hold a telethon. (It's the one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHope">Bob Hope</a>.) One of the auditioning acts is a pair of Polish brothers who juggle. However, only one shows up and says that his brother is still in Poland. After some encouragement, he performs anyway. Unfortunately, part of his act involves throwing the pins to his brother and they hit the wall instead. By the time of the telethon, his brother still hasn't gotten out of Poland, but he tries to perform anyway. He gets booed off the stage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> has had a few examples over the years:
<ul><li> Politician Roy Hattersley pulled out of a 1993 episode at the last minute. There was no time to find a replacement, and as it was the third time he had cancelled on the show late in the day, they replaced him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">a tub of lard</a>, making jokes about how the tub shared many qualities with Hattersley and was "liable to give much the same performance".
</li><li> Regular team captain Ian Hislop was suffering from appendicitis during a 1994 episode, and checked himself out of hospital to film one episode because he was determined not to miss a recording. He is noticeably more short-tempered than usual throughout the episode in question, at one point launching into a long rant about how horrible everyone involved in a story about a politician having affairs with a married woman and both of her daughters was, which was only stopped when the host pointed out that nobody had actually given the answer yet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> was due to appear in a 2001 episode, but pulled out at the last minute. With the show having received quite a bit of publicity from the news of John's appearance, he was replaced by Ray Johnson, a taxi driver who had a side earning as an Elton John lookalike and was introduced to the audience as if he really was Elton John. Johnson remained silent for the entire episode, and the only time the deception was admitted to was in onscreen captions between rounds, which praised Johnson whilst repeatedly referring to the real Elton John as a "bastard".
</li><li> Following multiple scandals about his private life, host Angus Deayton was sacked midway through a series, the day before the next episode was due to be recorded. The other team captain, Paul Merton, hosted the first episode following his dismissal, with the series then switching to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost">Guest Hosts</a>. It was intended to be a temporary measure whilst they sought a permanent replacement, but it led to a boost in ratings and became a permanent element of the show.
</li><li> The Spring 2020 series still went ahead despite the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, by having all the panellists filmed from their homes and composited into a virtual set.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> lead singer Freddie Mercury contracted AIDS and was in increasingly poor health through the last few years of his career. He kept recording though, as, well you know. The band lampshaded it with an absolute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> of a song named, unsurprisingly, "The Show Must Go On".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> lead singer Dave Grohl broke his leg during a tour, but instead of stopping the concert, he just kept playing and singing, even while a paramedic was putting bandages on his broken leg, even if fans might have accepted if he stopped the song while his leg was being treated. The next several concerts, he played while sitting on Gibson's Guitar-Throne he had borrowed.
</li><li> Axl Rose recently did the same as the above-mentioned Dave Grohl when he broke a leg during a show. Instead of canceling the concert or the remainder of the tour, he just continued singing sitting down (Dave Grohl even lent him his throne for Guns N' Roses' 2016 Coachella performance).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> has a song by this name, where Pink, after having a long personal journey through is past is injected with drugs and forced onstage, despite not being sure if he would even remember the songs.

He got back up and finished the rest of the set list before going to the hospital, despite the fact that he would have been in severe pain.
</li><li> "The Show Must Go On", a song first written and performed by Leo Sayer, then covered by Three Dog Night, is all about this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> had a rather scary incident of this trope when a burning metal prop <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7WNfwiSh2Y">melted its riggings and fell into the crowd, severely injuring several people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The guitarists immediately stopped playing, though the keyboardist, drummer, and bass player continued with the song. Flake, the keyboardist, eventually ran forward and grabbed a guitar, prompting cheers from the crowd, and the concert resumed even as roadies frantically attempted to extinguish the burning prop and tend to the injured. This incident eventually resulted in Rammstein completely rewriting their policies around pyrotechnics.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Pro Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The WWF suffered this trope in 1999 during their <em>Over The Edge</em> pay-per-view event, due to the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> happening as he was making his ring entrance. Fortunately, the incident occurred while viewers were watching a pre-recorded segment, so they never saw it; when the live broadcast resumed, all they saw were the ring announcers discussing what had happened. After a brief delay, the broadcast continued, which garnered the organization some criticism later.
</li><li> This actually happens often in professional wrestling (though fortunately rarely to the same degree as Owen Hart). The most common causes are legit injuries and/or botched moves, or in rarer cases, botched use of props, weapons or equipment.
</li><li> We'll say that professional wrestling is like this in general. As a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-pro-wrestlers-are-best-actors-in-world/">article put it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a wrestler is supposed to stay in character no matter what happens. Your opponent is legitimately trying to injure you? Ignore it and stay in character. You tore your ACL? Broke your ribs? Don't break character. <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">One of the competitors died during the match</a></strong></em>, and you're being charged with manslaughter? You can't even let that break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>.
<ul><li> A specific example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> at the 2010 <em>Elimination Chamber</em> pay-per-view, who got <em>set on fire</em> during his entrance due to mistimed/misaligned pyrotechnics going off. Instead of going backstage to get the injury treated, he went down to the ring where he was in a pod for his cue, being handed bottles of water to douse himself with in the meantime.
</li></ul></li><li> This happened on Raw once with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a>, who, in the middle of a tag team match he was calling, suffered a heart attack.

The heart attack was later announced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Michael Cole</a>, who seemed visibly shaken up. The show continued, but there was no commentary throughout the rest of the show, other than Cole providing updates on his condition. The rest of the show felt so... cold after this.

</li><li> The WWE continued to create <em>WWE RAW</em> and <em>SmackDown</em> during the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, holding all their events at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, all without an audience.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 36 was initially scheduled to take place in the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.

The Leading Player apologizes to the audience that the promised finale cannot be presented, offers the part to anyone in the audience, and then orders everybody out, including the orchestra, leaving Pippin, Catherine and Theo to end the show on a denuded dark stage.

Steals a carton of OJ from the bar and two clementines from the florist's lunchbox, and gets back to work as if nothing happened. And manages to produce a good cake.

Bobby grows to hate this new attention, but mutters "the show must go on" when he realizes that being at the edge of the spotlight is better than not having attention at all.

Rather than stop the show, the band recruited an amateur drummer (the late <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scot_Halpin">Scott Halpin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) from the audience to replace him and finish the show.
</li><li> Similarly, a 2002 performance by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows">Counting Crows</a> in Los Angeles saw drummer Ben Mize fall ill mid-show, requiring his hospitalization. After a brief intermission, the band switched to acoustic instruments and performed several songs without a drummer, before drummers Randy Guss of Toad the Wet Sprocket (their opening band) and Todd Roper of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cake">CAKE</a> (who was in the audience) were persuaded to appear onstage to finish the show.
</li><li> Naturally, anybody who has appeared in live performances can testify to problems involved in cast members, problems with props or any number of unforeseen difficulties. The universal rallying cry is, in all circumstances, the Trope Title. This is why it is common practice for theatrical productions to hire stand-in actors who are available at a moment's notice to cover for a performer who is forced to miss a show due to illness or other reason.
</li><li> Comic <a class="urllink" href="http://red-skelton.info/biographies/red-skelton-biography/">Red Skelton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, on a live 1950s show, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeUNIp4vH7I">was doing a sketch with a cow,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals">which started defecating</a>, for a very long time.

Gleason filled time by improvising jokes and comedically tying his tie, while also taking a moment to explain to the viewers what happened.
</li><li> Live TV broadcasts in the 1950s were notorious for running under-time. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfJ6exSnIA">Here is an example<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanMartin">Dean Martin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis">Jerry Lewis</a> having to ad-lib material when one of their specials from the 1950s ran short by several minutes.
</li><li> Reportedly, when recording "The Show Must Go On" (mentioned above), Freddie Mercury was in seriously bad shape because of his battle with AIDS. One of the other band members approached him and asked him if he wanted to take a break. What Mercury did was down a glass of vodka and say "I'll fucking do it, darling!" before proceeding to nail the song in <em>one take</em> in what Brian May considers one of Freddie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">greatest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">performances</a>.
</li><li> Before opening night of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Rent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Rent">RENT</a></em>, composer Jonathan Larson collapsed and died. Needless to say, the cast moved on to perform the next night.
<ul><li> What's more, when the cast was told, they decided to pay their respects by just singing through it seated around a table. By the time they got to "La Vie Boheme", everyone simultaneously agreed that Jonathan would want to see the show as it was meant to be, got up, and did the entire rest of the show, sans costumes.
</li></ul></li><li> When a member of one of the Big Name Bands headlining at the Download musical festival fell ill on the night, members of several other bands performing at the festival stepped in to take his place for the set list, to prevent a possible riot if one of the bands that almost everyone wanted to see didn't perform as scheduled.

<ul><li> Another concert in Africa was disrupted when the police released tear gas to tame the increasingly wild crowd. While his backup singers and most of the musicians fled the stage, Bob kept singing, somehow able to shake off the effects of the gas.
</li><li> His final concert, where he performed flawlessly for several hours, including two encores, despite being riddled with cancer.

After several minutes spent sweeping glass off the stage, getting Yow to his feet, and making sure he was okay, they started the same song over again and continued with the show. Yow even tried to taunt his attacker into doing it again before moving on.
</li><li> During a 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> concert, lead vocalist Rob Halford collided with a drum riser while riding his motorcycle onto the stage, falling off his bike and breaking his nose. After regaining consciousness he returned to the stage and performed the remainder of the show despite the fact that he was in severe pain at the time. Halford didn't go to the hospital until after the concert was over.
</li><li> In 1986 James Hetfield of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> broke his wrist in a skateboarding accident, rendering him unable to play rythym guitar. Hetfield's guitar tech, John Marshall, filled in on rythym guitar until the injury healed (James still sang, being the band's lead vocalist in addition to the rythym guitarist). This incident prompted Hetfield's record company to include a clause in his contract forbidding him from riding a skateboard while the band was on tour.

Lou continued with the show anyways, saying "Wherever he is tonight, I want him to hear me." The stress of performing under those conditions was so great that he fainted as soon as the broadcast was over.
</li><li> During the filming of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode "The Devil in the Dark" in January, 1967, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> received the news that his father had died. Shatner insisted on finishing the day's work, and only flew home to Montréal after filming had wrapped.
</li><li> 75 minutes into the 1956 FA Cup Final, Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann was injured in a collision. There were no substitutes allowed in those days, so Trautmann played on, making crucial saves to ensure City's victory in spite of being in severe pain. He even attended the post match banquet in that state. Eventually, he sought medical help: it turned out that Trautmann had broken his <em>neck</em>.
</li><li> While on tour to promote the band's latest album, <em>Animals</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a> was suffering from what he though was stomach cramps (it later turned out to be hepatitis), so the band doctor injected him with a powerful muscle relaxant so he could go onstage. He said that he could have played through the pain, but whatever the doctor injected him with caused him to be barely able to lift his arm, causing him to go through "the longest two hours of my life" playing that concert. This experience inspired the classic song "Comfortably Numb."
</li><li> During the TV play <em>Underground</em>, broadcast live on the BBC in 1958, actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died backstage. Actors hurriedly improvised lines along the lines of, "I'm sure if X was here, he would say..." and the writer used an ad break to cobble together an ending to the play.
</li><li> After losing his wife, Bob Barker continued to host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a>, even though he had every reason to take a break.
</li><li> During a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden, in June 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> fell off the stage and broke one of his legs. He excused himself for a short period while the other Foo Fighters kept playing, then returned to the stage, carried by paramedics who put him in a chair. He kept playing for over two hours - even while the paramedics were putting his leg in a cast.
<ul><li> He then had a totally bitchin' throne made for him to sit in on stage so he could still play the rest of the tour dates. He loved the throne so much, he continued to use it even after his leg was healed enough to walk on.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1994, in spite of the severe injuries suffered by Ayrton Senna, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> decided to restart the San Marino Grand Prix after cleaning up his wreckage and taking him to the hospital.

The organizers let the race continue even after his death, and, at Allan's family's request, the Aston Martin team (which he raced for) stayed in the race.
</li><li> During a performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville">The Barber of Seville</a></em>, American mezzo-soprano Joyce Di Donato fell onstage and broke her fibula. Ignoring the pain, she finished the rest of the act hobbling around the stage and used crutches for the rest of the opera. And as if this wasn't enough, Di Donato refused to let her injury prevent her from singing in the rest of her scheduled performances and sang the role of Rosina from a wheelchair for the five remaining shows in her schedule. If one is familiar with the insane difficulty that is inherent to singing the works of Gioacchino Rossini, even while standing upright and in no pain whatever, the respect level for Di Donato's dedication can't help but go higher.
</li><li> The great French actor and playwright Moliere was in the middle of a performance when he collapsed in a fit of coughing and haemhorrhaging. He recovered, completed the show, and died a few hours later. Ironically, the play he was performing was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImaginaryInvalid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImaginaryInvalid">The Imaginary Invalid</a>,</em> in which he played a hypochondriac.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a> drummer Mike Portnoy performed an entire 3+ hour concert while suffering from a mixture of exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, and stress, collapsing once the show was over. Said concert was recorded and released as a live album, <em>Live Scenes from New York</em>.

According to the DVD commentary, Tea Leoni, who played Jane, dislocated her shoulder while shooting the part where she slides on the counter, but kept going anyway. You'll see that when the scene ends that she's struggling to hold the things they steal.

</li><li> After Robert Wickens' <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV0f5lZW96k">horrifying crash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at Pocono in 2018, The Indycar community said that they would finish out the season, even with heavy hearts, giving the trope name as the reason. They said they owed it to the fans and to Wickens, Dan Wheldon and Justin Wilson (the latter two dying in motorsports crashes in 2011 and 2015 respectively) to keep going.

</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckTick">Buck Tick</a> Parade Tour 2007, the lead singer, Atsushi Sakurai, suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a> where his pants ripped off from knee to groin. He removed his coat and put around his waist to cover the damage while singing. After the song, he informed the audiences about his ripped pants much to their laughter and amusingly apologized if they actually took a glimpse of whatever they saw in his pants.
</li><li> The day before a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball">Monday Night Football</a> game against the Oakland Raiders, Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre learned his father died from a heart attack. Even though he was offered the chance to sit the game out, Favre decided to play anyway, believing it was what his father would have wanted him to do. He went on to have one of the best performances of his career, throwing for 399 yards, 4 touchdowns, and achieving a passer rating of 153.9 enroute to a 41-7 victory.
</li><li> The 2019-20 Coronavirus outbreak caused several conferences, events, concerts and music festivals to be cancelled or postponed (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MonsterJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MonsterJam">Monster Jam</a> did some shows as scheduled but postponed others), however some events (for example the Philadelphia Flower Show) went on as scheduled.
