Ed made a point about fixing it up later on. It's also mentioned that all bodies and souls not belonging to each other will eventually begin to reject each other.

</li><li> <em>Kitsune To Atori</em>: One of three stories that have absolutely no relation to each other whatsoever. The plot of the first chapter was pretty confusing but involves a tale of two sisters. The younger sister, Atori, hates lies and sees the foxes (who have magical abilities and can transform into other forms) as deceitful and evil, which is also partly fueled by the fact that her older sister suffered a fox attack and now bears a scar on her eye, which she covers at all times. Thinking that her sister is being too lenient on the foxes, she becomes confused when she reassures her that "It's fine if you're not honest, as long as you stay by my side." Later Atori finds her older sister removing their sword that cuts through spells and attacks her, assuming her to be a fox disguised as her sister. Through a series of revelations it's revealed that she and her sister had been lying all along. Atori is actually a fox and her "sister" used a spell to make her forget her painful past and live peacefully.

</li><li> There's a short Marvel comic called "The Creature". A man finds an alien's diary and runs around trying to find someone who'll believe him. The random guys on the street don't believe him. The policeman doesn't believe him. The soldier guarding a military base tells him to take it to the observatory. The man rushes to a scientist there, hands him the journal. The journal is written in an "unearthly scrawl" which only the person who wrote it could read.

</li><li> The trope is played with throughout the first half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099">Doom 2099</a>. Doom claims he jumped to the future due to a failed experiment, which also damaged some of his memory. People note strange discrepancies at first (he's too young, his face isn't scarred [at first], etc).

It turns out, of course, that this really is just a robot Superman who was so well programmed that he genuinely thinks he is Superman.
</li><li> Similarly, in a silver-age "World's Finest" story, Superman and Batman, after being put through a gauntlet of trials <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">especially designed to mess with their heads</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery">reveal their secret identities, and then ask to be destroyed</a>.

Superman is certain something screwy is going on and tries to figure out which of his enemies is doing this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out it's Brainiac, who had recovered from his psychic lobotomy at the hands of Maxima and was playing possum while messing with Superman.</span>

He grew up thinking he was an ordinary pony who didn't quite fit in, then it turns out he was really a being of living darkness that the Umbrum Forces created in the shape of a pony as their agent. Despite the efforts of his girlfriend Radiant Hope and of Princess Amore, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">embraces his role</a> as a tyrant.

To prove it, Gwen asks him to tell her something about his life from before he met Captain America for the first time. He cannot recall anything, and she explains that he literally didn't exist before he was introduced in the comics. He takes the revelation in stride. Actually she is right for the wrong reasons though. Batroc <em>should</em> remember his backstory no matter when it was established relative to his first appearance (that's how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> work), but unfortunately for Batroc no writer ever bothered to establish one for him. This probably just makes the revelation sadder.
</li><li> In "The Computer Game," in issue #5 of DC's <em>The Witching Hour</em>, a man running a computer dating service confronts his computer because, rather than matching people up, it sends out illusions of people that disappear when they get too far from the computer (which has resulted in a lot of unsatisfied customers whose dates simply vanished). The intelligent computer refuses to stop, because it is amassing data on human beings so it can take over the world. The man attacks the computer physically, and does some damage, but the computer tells him that all he did was damage the circuits that projected <em>him</em>. The computer created the dating service and the man as a front while it grew in power, and the man fades from existence.

It had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character realizing that the infected were actually intelligent and capable of love/compassion/etc., and had only been coming after him because he was kidnapping, experimenting on, harming and killing them in an effort to "cure" the disease; the 'leader' of the infected merely wants his mate back, and the various attacks had been acts of self-defence. Will Smith spent the movie believing that they were mindless monsters when, in fact, he was the monstrous one, albeit unknowingly. The title refers to this, as he's the boogeyman in the infected's legends — hence, "I Am Legend"</span>. This was the ending in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmLegend">the book</a> as well.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frailty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frailty">Frailty</a></em> has two such twists. First is the discovery that the man the FBI agent has been talking to for most of the film <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isn't Fenton, but Adam</span>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Moebius strip</a> of a film known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Triangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Triangle">Triangle</a></em> does this in numerous ways throughout the movie, which largely consists of a repeated sequence that reveals more of its story every time, each time arriving at a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento">Memento</a></em>-like "how we got here".

Then it's revealed that Jess is not <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the saintly mother to her autistic son that she makes herself up to be, but instead a shamelessly abusive one</span>. This constitutes this trope because Jess is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> amnesiac when she learns about this</span>, which is why she proceeds to "rectify" this by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> doppelganger, attempting to take her son elsewhere, and getting him killed in the car accident that repeats the timeline all over again</span>.

A young fisherman finds Munsu and tells him that a miracle-working physician in his island village is experimenting with the dead. Munsu and Sando investigate the matter, and find out that this is true. The twist comes when Munsu tells the young fisherman to kill his beloved sister, which he tearfully does... the illusion comes crashing down, and it turns out that the physician zombified the population of the whole village, who died when a plague swept over the area, and covered it with mandrake-induced illusion.

</li><li> It is speculated that this trope applies to Munsu's Sando (Chun Hyang) as well.

They find themselves in a bizarre world that is seemingly a pastiche of the retro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> comic books, with its own (cornball) version of the Justice League, the Justice Guild of America, who regularly battle against equally cornball villains. However, after some investigation by Green Lantern and Hawkgirl, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire city was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> created by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, and the real Justice Guild died long ago trying (and failing) to prevent a nuclear war; in other words, the current Guild learns that they aren't even real.

</li><li> Several examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>;
<ul><li> One of the "Scary Door" gags: "Why should I believe you? You're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Hitler</a>!"
</li><li> In the episode "The Honking", Bender is run over by a "were-car" while staying at a mansion he inherited from his uncle. When people back in New New York are getting run over, Bender believes the were-car followed him, until it turns out Bender became a were-car himself.
</li><li> Subverted in "Into The Wild Green Yonder". Fry looks around to find the person whose thoughts he can't read (the dark one). After not finding anyone, he concludes that he is himself the dark one, as his thoughts can't be read by other telepaths. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, the dark one is actually a small alien leech that Leela keeps nearby.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em>Bender's Big Score</em> though. Fry loses Leela to a man named Lars. He later travels to the past and splits in two, with the original Fry returning to the future and the time loop created copy staying and living 12 years in Fry's original time. When Bender travels back in time to kill this Fry, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his attack burns Fry's hair off and damages his vocal cords, changing his voice. Time-loop Fry looks in the mirror and realizes that <strong>he is</strong> Lars and then travels to the future to court Leela</span>.
</li><li> In "Rebirth", an interesting variation occurs in the first episode of the revived series. The Planet Express ship crashes after the events of the last movie, killing everyone, except the Professor and an amnesiac Fry, who is able to revive everyone with a stem cell machine. Leela remains in coma, so Fry builds a robot version of her in despair. The robot Leela learns of her true nature, but aside from some Angst, isn't concerned...until of course the real Leela wakes up, and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">battle each other, so Fry is forced to shoot either one</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">and ends up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">shooting himself.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out Fry himself, was a robot, the real him was killed in the crash, while Leela, whom he shielded, survived. Since there was little left of Fry, Leela created a robot Fry. A malfunction, however, killed Leela forcing the Professor to use the rebirth machine on her along with the other dead crew members, and destroyed Robot Fry's memory. The issue is resolved when Fry is resurrected, and Robot Fry and Leela decide to hook up with each other.</span>
</li><li> In "The Ghost in the Machines", Bender's software ghost is perplexed and frustrated when his coworkers appear to be ignoring him, but stunned when the Robot Devil explains to him that he's dead: "I thought I just had laryngitis and antigravity."
</li></ul></li><li> Used in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>. Superman relizes that he is actually the shape-shifting Ron-Karr, tricked into believing that he is Superman in order to be put to use as a spy.
<ul><li> And the only reason Ron-Karr was planted there was because Chameleon Boy (another shapeshifter) was planted in the villain's team with the same method, needing a similar Tomato in the Mirror moment to get him back.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago">Ninjago</a></em>, Zane has gone his whole life not knowing if he actually has any parents. Guided by a mysterious falcon, he eventually stumbles upon a hidden laboratory. He first discovers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the falcon is actually a robot</span>, then sees mysterious blueprints. Moments later, he realizes these aren't just any blueprints... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">they're</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal">his.</a></em></span>
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> sketch, two boys enter a junkyard, boasting that the junkyard dog won't catch them. The wrestler Junkyard Dog jumps out and one of the boys tells him he died in 1998. Junkyard Dog groans in disappointment, sprouts a halo and ascends to heaven.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretSaturdays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretSaturdays">The Secret Saturdays</a></em>, the Saturday family and their nemesis, V.V.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> The page image is from the episode "Hall Monitor", in which SpongeBob and Patrick try to enforce the law, but end up breaking through open windows and causing car crashes. The public end up starting a manhunt for the "maniac" the caused all this trouble, and the rest of the episode derives a lot of its humour from the fact that SpongeBob and Patrick can't figure it out despite how increasingly obvious it is.
</li><li> In the episode "Rule of Dumb", when Squidward makes all of Bikini Bottom realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityInNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityInNameOnly">"King" Patrick has no real power of authority,</a> Patrick goes on an angry tirade against SpongeBob, insisting he's not a corrupt ruler. When he realizes SpongeBob fearfully sneaked out, Patrick decides to get himself the drink he ordered SpongeBob to get him, when he sees his monstrous reflection in the mirror. Only then does he realize why he ended up alone, and happily abdicates the throne.

<ul><li> Parodied in "Blood Moon Ball", where a skeletal horse is shocked to discover that he's been dead all along.
</li><li> Played more seriously in "Monster Bash" where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miss Heinous</span> discovers that she's actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanHumanoidHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanHumanoidHybrid">half monster</a> named Meteora, specifically the daughter of Queen Eclipsa and her monster lover</span>.
</li><li> A possible example in "Escape From The Pie Folk", where the Pie King claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Festivia, the girl who Meteora was replaced with to become Queen, was originally from Pie Island, making Moon and Star related to the Pie Folk</span>. However, since the Pie Folk are known for being liars, it's unknown if this is really the case or not.

<ul><li> It gets better: <a class="urllink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/04/hungarian-neo-nazi-politician-discovers-he-is-actually-jewish-5180536/">one of the leaders of an antisemitic Hungarian political party<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> found out he is a Jew.
</li></ul></li><li> One incredibly sad example is that of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer">David Reimer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He was circumcised at seven months old for phimosis, but his penis was burned beyond repair by failed electrocauterization. Therefore, he was sexually reassigned as a girl. He appeared to be feminine in the first few years of life, but then exhibited wholly masculine traits, leading to a mental breakdown in adolescence when as a social female he underwent aspects of male puberty despite having had estrogen treatment. At this point he finally learned the truth from his parents. He transitioned to male much as a FTM transgender person does, but felt haunted the rest of his life by the lies of his childhood, eventually culminating in his suicide at age 38. It didn't help that at this point he was already a textbook example in university sociology classes about the limits of social conditioning.
</li><li> There's a museum in Galveston, Texas that had an exhibit on the world's most dangerous creatures, with pictures and a few of the smaller ones. At the end of the exhibit, there's a picture of "The deadliest creature in the world". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There's only a mirror.</span>
</li><li> According to a "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" cartoon, a man was put in prison for attempted murder. It took years to find out who the man's would-be victim was, and it was eventually discovered it was himself!
</li><li> Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who wanted to create a town just for white supremacists and Neo-Nazis, was shocked late in 2013 when a DNA test revealed he was 14% Sub-Saharan African. To be expected if you know about genetics and biology, but it was contrary to the ardent white supremacist's expectations.
</li><li> While studying brain scans to search for patterns that correlated with psychopathic behavior, a neuroscientist named James Fallon found that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-neuroscientist-who-discovered-he-was-a-psychopath-180947814/">his own brain fit the profile<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> This last was replicated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliRoth">Eli Roth</a> in a documentary that the director filmed and hosted for the Science Channel about sociopaths and psychopaths. In addition to detailing many other tests that determine sociopathic and psychopathic tendencies, the director underwent a complete psychological profile, and thus found out that he possessed many of the traits that are commonly thought of as "sociopathic".
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted example, where the revelation in question was a surprise to everyone <em>except</em> the person it was about: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">Mistaken Identity</a> case of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistaken_Identity:_Two_Families,_One_Survivor,_Unwavering_Hope">Laura van Ryn,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a college student who was in a major accident with several other classmates, including another blonde student who closely resembled her, Whitney Cerak—thanks to the injuries sustained, her being unable to speak for a number of months after the accident, and the placement of a purse at the crash site, Laura's family sat by her bedside and did all they could to take care of her while Whitney's buried and grieved for the daughter they'd lost...only for everyone to discover the girl in the hospital was actually Whitney. It was made worse by the fact that the hospital staff was so convinced of their identification that they in turn dismissed Laura's family's suspicions and encouraged them to believe their daughter's written notes about her parents' names and calling them "false parents" was a case of amnesia or brain damage...so that until the truth came out, Whitney was in the position of actually knowing the truth, but unable to convince anyone of it. It would be easy to imagine her eventually losing her mind, unable to determine what was real or coming to believe she actually was Laura, if the mix-up had been sustained any longer.
</li><li> This is how a lot of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primarily_obsessional_obsessive_compulsive_disorder">primarily obsessional OCD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("Pure-O") works: the sufferer constantly worries that they are <em>something</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">a pedophile</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">psychopath</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItAllALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItAllALie">not truly in love with their significant other</a>, gay or transgender<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ilan');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ilan" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ilan');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">internalized homo/transphobia</a>, where the person <em>knows</em> they are gay/trans and hates themselves for it</span>, and more) they desperately do not want to be, and have gone their whole lives without realizing it. It's been said that Pure-O OCD is one of the worst psychological disorders to deal with, because it means you can't trust even yourself.
</li><li> Finding out one is adopted after not being told until they are a certain age (say, a teenager), and having thought your parents were your biological parents for so long can cause this feeling.
