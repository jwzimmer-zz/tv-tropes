They punch harder, take more hits, and aren't afraid of breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">certain laws of physics</a>. There's a problem with having giants as part of the main cast, though: they don't fit in small places. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> has to lead his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Base</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness">Evil Tower of Ominousness</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> can't really follow along if his hand can completely block off the entrance. It also becomes much more difficult to keep everyone on panel or camera if there are huge height discrepancies.
</p><p>Fortunately, animators have found the solution to this problem: completely disregard any sense of consistent scale! Sure, the giant is half the size of the building... on the <em>outside</em>! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">On the inside</a>, he's got a good 10 or so feet (3 m) of space between his head and the ceiling. This effect is particularly noticeable when size is compared to other characters; a regularly-sized human might stand about as tall as the giant's hip in a regular scenario, but the giant will easily catch that same character in the palm of one hand in a later action sequence.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The same lack of consistency holds true for tiny characters as well. Unless size is specified, characters who are simply stated to be "small" tend to bounce between the size of a housecat and a rat, or for even smaller characters, a rat and a roach. Don't be surprised if a fairy who fits in a character's shirt pocket later turns out to be as big as a baseball in a later fight.
</p><p>Note that this trope mostly applies to animation and special effects. It is rather... <em>difficult</em> to modify the size of an actor in a live-action series. Though in some cases there might be a size discrepancy due to the visual requirements of keeping two actors of wildly different heights in the same frame. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScullyBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScullyBox">Scully Box</a> for that. Perspective can also be a tricky thing, ane some angles might unintentionally give an odd size comparison even if the math is right. This trope does not cover creatures or characters that can change <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sizeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sizeshifter">size</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">shape</a> at will, though their giant or tiny forms may fall victim to this trope on their own (and see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterBaggage">Shapeshifter Baggage</a>).

<ul><li> Guts's signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, Dragon Slayer, tends to change size. Usually, it's about as tall as he is, but it's been known to gain or lose a few feet of length, especially when he starts swinging it around.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, especially noticeable with Rukia's height relative to Ichigo (and sometimes Renji). And with Yachiru's height compared to Kenpachi. Officially she's about half his height, not counting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a>. Yet frequently Yachiru is drawn as only slightly larger than Kenpachi's <em>head</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> A major offender is the Greymon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, who sometimes stands several stories tall, yet has frequently had fights within hallways of normal buildings.
</li><li> Metalgreymon's size relative to the Weregarurumon, where the latter can be small enough to ride on the former's missiles to standing approximately shoulder height next to him <em>1 minute later.</em>
</li><li> Birdramon also has issues, typically always being the largest of the Champions, carrying a couple of the kids on a single claw, but sometimes growing to the size of a large Mega like Machinedramon.
</li><li> Another is Greymon's counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>, Growlmon, who was the size of a large house in his introduction, but was later depicted as being much, much smaller.
</li><li> Ankylomon shrank after his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>.
</li><li> In the second <em>Digimon Adventure 02</em> movie, Angemon and Angewomon are shown to be stonking larger than they usually are.
</li><li> In <em>Adventure</em>, MegaSeadramon and Ikkakumon have a battle at relatively the same size during the Myotismon arc. By Episode 16 of <em>Adventure 02</em>, MegaSeadramon positively dwarves Ikkakumon.
</li><li> Possibly more egregious between seasons. Magnamon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> was adult-sized. The one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">a freakish goliath</a></em>.
</li><li> The greatest offenders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> is Korikakumon and MetalKabuterimon, who tower over human spirits and most of the other beast sprits by more than double and are absolutely massive compared to the human characters themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">Zephyrmon</a> and the human spirits have occasionally been scaled up to Korikakumon's size as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> An Oozaru's size seems to vary depending on what they're interacting with. When Goku is tearing apart the castle, he seems to be almost as big as the whole thing, but when interacting with his friends, he appears to be about as big as a chunk of the castle he had earlier picked up and threw. The anime adds a bunch of padding and changes the scene around so that he stays pretty consistently on the larger end of the size scale, but that still makes him seem smaller the second time he transforms. Z and GT are a bit better about this.
</li><li> Also Chi Chi's father the Ox King. In his first appearance he was a giant easily twice the size of a full-grown adult. About midway through the series he seems to get a bit smaller, but still a giant. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> he seems to be just barely taller than Goku.
</li><li> This could be said for most of the cast in DBZ. Goku, who is 5'9, is constantly shown as tall or taller than Yamcha and Tien, who are 6'0 and 6'2 respectively. Piccolo, despite being 7'6, has been shown to be only a head taller than Goku, but literally twice as tall as Krillin. Vegeta suffers from this the least, however. He is supposedly either as tall or shorter than Bulma (he's 5'4), but he is often shown to be only an inch shorter than Goku, while looking a full head taller than Krillin, who is officially listed as 5'0.
<ul><li> Vegeta also grows noticeably taller over the course of the series. In the Saiyan Saga, he's drawn in a way that emphasizes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuyLittleGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuyLittleGuy">Big Guy, Little Guy</a> dynamic with Nappa. Once Nappa's dead, he's drawn closer in height to the main characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Another odd example is Chiaotzu. He is supposedly 4'6.5", but usually doesn't even come halfway up the taller Z fighters, being even smaller than Gohan was as a child. Super seems to put him at the same size as Marron, Krillin and 18's five year old daughter, while other shots make him appear almost doll-sized compared to Tien.
</li><li> King Cold seems to range from 15 to 30 feet tall. Also, when he acquires Trunks' sword, it becomes big enough for him to wield properly.
</li><li> Hercule/Mr. Satan is officially 6'2 but randomly looks 10' tall in some scenes of the manga.
</li><li> Whenever Gohan and Krillin appear in the same panel, Krillin is usually drawn so he is a bit taller than Gohan. This means that he sometimes is barely taller than a 4-year-old during the Saiyan Saga, and sometimes looks taller than he should be in the Cell Saga when Gohan has grown a lot. In other panels, his height seems more consistent.
</li><li> All of the characters are given very low official weights for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">how they're drawn</a>. Goku, for instance, weighs 138 pounds at 5'9, which theoretically would give him a bantamweight MMA fighter's build like <a class="urllink" href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-6WL2JM3l_LzLo8MOw_HZy1DDks=/0x0:1820x1213/920x613/filters:focal(395x70:685x360):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66243078/204_Urijah_Faber_vs_Dominick_Cruz.0.0.0.jpg">Dominick Cruz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> or <a class="urllink" href="http://imgnews.naver.net/image/241/2015/05/02/2015050223315642100_99_20150502233402.jpg">Yoon Jun Lee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

A Valkyrie ought to be able to fit into the pilot's compartment of a Glaug or Regult. This is because the Zentradi themselves are at roughly the same height as a Valkyrie (the Battroid mode being explicitly created so that humans could fight on an equal footing with Zentradi soldiers). However, when a Valkyrie and a Regult or Glaug are shown on screen at the same time, they are shown as around the same size — the Zentradi mecha should tower over the Valkyrie, being at the very minimum half again as high.
</li><li> Later series got better about this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, macronized Klan Klan, when her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Quedluun</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Rau</a> was out of commission, donned a FAST pack and the applique armor of a VF-25 over her spacesuit as if it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>.

Sometimes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> were too big or too tiny, and the human beings and other objects too tiny. In episode 10, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beast</a> grabbed skyscrapers with one of his hands and moved them to elsewhere. Initially his hands seemed as big as the buildings they were carrying, but later on he was just as tall as Mazinger-Z (18 meters), so his hands were way tinier than they should have been.

Justified by the fact that shapeshifting has been established as one of her powers from the very beginning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">bigger</a> summons in can be subject to this.

A more noticeable example is Gamaken who's first appearance <a class="urllink" href="https://kissmanga.com/Manga/Naruto/Chapter-375?id=377524#7">shows him as about the size of a small house<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but on his second <a class="urllink" href="https://kissmanga.com/Manga/Naruto/Chapter-430?id=377579#2">he's as big as Gamabunta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaves</a> this with Gamakichi demonstrating a size-altering jutsu that allowed him (and presumably other large summons) to shrink to a more convenient size if needed.
</li><li> The Tailed Beasts also appear to vary in size. The most notable example is the Nine-Tailed Fox; his first appearance portrays him as towering around 300m over the forests on the outskirts of the Leaf Village (implying that the trees are only 50m tall), a human being only the size of his pupil. Throughout the series, he is portrayed as being about a third that size <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">— mainly because only half of his chakra is sealed inside Naruto. However, in the latest fight between Naruto/Kurama and five of the Tailed Beasts, the fox aura is just as big, if not a little smaller, than the other beasts. Later on, with Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Six Paths Sage Mode</a> then with both halves combined, Kurama is returned to his original size, making him almost twice as large as the other tailed beasts (by indirect comparison)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The EVA Units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> are somewhere between 40 and 200 meters tall. One piece of concept art says Unit 01 is a more realistic <em>ten</em>, but the creators were honest enough to admit never worrying about anything aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">what would make an interesting visual</a>, and as a result the Evas' size relative to buildings, known landmarks, people, etc., changed from episode to episode.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> seems to more consistently stick with 80m. Conversely, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> (where a mech's size determines its probability of getting hit and in some games damage taken) each unit is only <strong>15</strong> meters for gameplay purposes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a></em>, the EVAs are described in the mech database as being 40 meters tall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Often surprisingly good about this, despite having characters who vary in size between about 3' (90 cm) tall to 9'10" (301 cm), and that's just the main cast. Secondary characters and especially villains can get enormous. The group of pirates known as the <em>Seven Warlords of the Sea</em> (see Moria below) have an <em>average</em> height of around 15 feet (4.5 m), but change slightly to suit whoever they're talking to.
</li><li> Sometimes, though, particularly on the interior of a ship, the taller characters like Brooke will shrink ever so slightly to keep it from looking too silly that they're all able to fit under the same roof.
</li><li> In Gecko Moria's initial appearance, his foot was twice as big as a normal-sized man was tall. By the time he actually got involved in the action, he had shrunk to a more manageable 18 feet (5.5 m) or so. Though the characters that were up to his foot were themselves later shown to only be about a third of the height of an "average" <em>One Piece</em> character, so Moria's height is actually fairly consistent.
</li><li> San Juan Wolf, the biggest character in the series, and a giant larger than any other giant portrayed so far is about the most absurd example yet. He makes the second largest character (who <em>himself</em> makes giants look small) seem unnoticeable by comparison, by appearing <em>behind</em> an island that character was on. So huge he's bigger than the building he was until recently imprisoned in, which also houses every other great criminal and was large enough that dozens of people could go missing. Uhh... Lampshaded by having him break the raft that his crew (averaging about 15 feet or 4.5 m without him) used up until this point, necessitating the need of a battleship. Both of which <em>should</em> be about the size of his hand.
<ul><li> There's also the fact that Wolf was imprisoned in Impel Down, despite seemingly being larger than the prison. And he's been seen in the ocean with no ill effects, so it can't be a Devil Fruit that lets him alter his size (which would negate the need for a larger ship anyway).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent">Princess Shirahoshi</a> is, in theory, 11.87 m (~39 feet) tall; in practice, she is almost never drawn to that scale, even taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a> into account. Generally her on-panel/screen appearances depict her about two to three times that height. Shes especially oversized in her first appearance, big enough for Luffy to stand between her breasts with room to spare in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon">That's No Moon!</a> moment. A number of shots even draw her larger than Megalo, whose mouth she's supposed to (barely) fit inside.
</li><li> Charlotte "Big Mom" Linlin is absolutely massive, as her epithet implies, but this varies drastically depending on the scene. She seems to be about Moriah's height on average, (roughly 18 to 22 feet). But other instances, such as her frequent hunger rampages, often amp up her height to towering over many of the buildings in her cities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is frequent in the anime. Dunsparce: Dunsparce are normally 4'11" (1.5m) in height, approximately the height of Ash. In "Following a Maiden's Voyage!" though, they appear to be shorter than a <em>Pidgey</em>... which is <em>1'00</em> (30cm). It should be noted that Pokemon longer than they are tall usually have their length given as their "height". Given its other proportions, though, a Dunsparce would still probably be considerably larger than a Pidgey.
</li><li> In the anime, Charizard's size would change all the time. It's usually about 1.5 times Ash's height (even then that's larger than the 5'7" or 170cm given in the game), but sometimes seems to be about the size of a car.
<ul><li> A good example of this is it's battle with Articuno. When it is using Seismic Toss, Articuno is larger, but when they are standing next to the trainers after the battle is over, Charizard is larger.
</li><li> This is further brought into notice when we encounter an entire alley of wild Charizard. Most of them, even the smallest, are nearly double the size of Ash's at minimum.
</li></ul></li><li> Ash's Staraptor; sometimes it comes up to Ash's shoulder rather than about Brock's height.
</li><li> Ash's Gliscor; usually it's about Ash's size, but sometimes it's only half that. In "Familiarity Breeds Strategy!", it was much larger than him. Possibly justified in that it had spent time away from Ash in training before it returned, and it was implied that this Gliscor was young when it evolved.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RodentsOfUnusualSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RodentsOfUnusualSize">Raticate</a> are sometimes <em>smaller than their pre-evo</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBirdOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBirdOfPrey">Fearow</a> are also ridiculously tiny; they're normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Giant Flyer</a> species.
</li><li> This isn't limited to Pokemon as occasionally the human character's heights are inconsistent. Misty is sometimes portrayed as a little taller then Ash while sometimes they're the same height. May started off of similar size as the former in her first appearance, but then was usually drawn slightly shorter than Ash.
</li><li> In the original games, Lillie was distinctly taller than characters her age and even her older brother, Gladion. In the anime she's shrunk down slightly to more average height, though she can still range anywhere from practically Mallow's height to being a little shorter than Ash depending on the shot.
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> manga, Pantyhose Tarō's cursed minotaur-like form. Depending on the needs of the scene, it can vary between about just twice as tall as a man, to being able to fit an human being comfortably into his palm. The addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> doesn't help; their length and thickness are quite variable too, where they can shift from a mess of relatively short tentacles on his back, to being twice as long than his cursed form is tall.
</li><li> The various mecha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em> vary in size from scene to scene. In one episode (set in an expy of India), Ken and Jinpei are standing at the base of a peacock statue that looks reasonably-sized. Then the mecha reveals itself, and is large enough to contain an army of goons <em>and</em> heavy machinery such as a crane with a wrecking ball. Other episodes have similar scale variations.
</li><li> Toyotomi Hideyoshi, from the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em>, is a great example of this. The man can't seem to stay the same size for ten minutes! He can go from just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller">a head taller</a> than the main character in one scene, and in the next, he can be almost on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Honda Tadakatsu</a>. His final episode fight with Masamune features this trope in spades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> remains quite consistent until the last few episodes. By the final battle, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and its equally large foe are alternately big enough to throw galaxies, just about able to fit the Earth in their palms, and able to make the Anti-Spiral homeworld in the Granzanboa's head-dress look about the size of an egg compared to a human. In short, they could be anywhere between the distance between Earth and the moon and the size of two and half galaxies; a factor of millions if not billions of multiples. Not to mention the final throw puts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaMecha">Meta Mecha</a> into play with the Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann emerging from the Tengen Toppa's mouth, and the Arc Gurren Lagann emerging from Super Galaxy's mouth—none of whom should even be visible next to each other, yet each seems to be (give or take) about the size of the larger robot's eyeball. Then again, considering the final battle takes place not in normal space but in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Pocket Dimension</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">where thought can shape reality and normal laws of physics might not apply at all</a>, it's hardly inconceivable for the mechs and their surroundings to not adhere to normal notions of scale.
<ul><li> Arc Gurren Lagann itself has problems in this range. Scale estimates of its size range from 150 meters tall (based on its transformation, where Gurren Lagann is about the same size as its face) to several kilometers tall (based on it being the same size as Dekabutsu) to at least one official statement of it being several <em>hundred</em> kilometers tall.

There's also one panel with Buck and Hyraxx where Hyraxx seems to be about half of Buck's height, while in all other panels she reaches to his chest. However this is probably because of the angle of the shot (the view in the panel is upward from near floor-level, which messes the perspective somewhat) rather than the relative sizes of the characters changing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> comic had the same problems as the cartoons; at the beginning of IDW's run, for example, Metroplex was shown to be large enough that he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrampledUnderfoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrampledUnderfoot">stomp a single Decepticon flat</a> under his foot (so a couple hundred feet tall) but by the time that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron">The Transformers: Dark Cybertron</a></em> happened he'd grown so large that the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Rodpod</a> (which could easily accommodate half a dozen Autobots with room to spare) could fly into his eye socket without scraping the sides, making Metroplex easily several <em>miles</em> tall (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that he's 15 kilometers tall in robot mode). Still, it was a little better about this than the G1 cartoon: size changing is an explicit power that Transformers have, so it's not super insane when Megatron changes into a gun in one shot and is then much smaller when wielded in the next. In fact, <em>tremendous</em> use is made of out of otherwise laughable transformations because they offer house-sized robot a way to pass disguised.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>'s height has varied so much it's pretty hard to tell how big he's supposed to be. Movies often cite an exact height for the monster. Originally he was supposed to be 50 meters tall. The Godzilla of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfGodzilla">The Return of Godzilla</a></em> was 80 meters tall, and he grew to 100 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsKingGhidorah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsKingGhidorah">Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah</a></em>. This is all well and good, but the special effects were often... inconsistent in this way.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsGigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsGigan">Godzilla vs. Gigan</a></em>, King Ghidorah looked like a fraction of the size of the Godzilla Tower in one scene, even though the tower was specifically said to be 50 meters tall and Ghidorah is 100 meters tall. Later, the 50 meter tall Godzilla stands next to the tower and is the same size as it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla">Terror of Mechagodzilla</a></em>, in one brief shot, Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus randomly look like they are the size of mountains, nearly filling up the sky, instead of about 50 and 60 meters tall respectively.
</li><li> The generally excellent (in terms of both SFX and story) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsBiollante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsBiollante">Godzilla vs. Biollante</a></em> features a particularly grievous blunder in scale in a scene featuring a psychic girl standing on an oil platform facing down Godzilla. Godzilla was supposed to be 80 meters tall. He looked maybe 20.
</li><li> It should be pointed out that each era of the Godzilla films takes place in a different universe (this is <em>especially</em> evident in the Millennium series, in which, apart from two exceptions, <em>each</em> film takes place in a separate continuity), thus it's reasonable the monsters aren't completely identical.
</li><li> This was kind of spurred on by real world changes. A 50 meter monster is huge in mid-twentieth century Tokyo (geographically busy locations tend to have strict building codes), but would look <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200109011235/http://www.dorkly.com/post/79969/huh-the-original-godzilla-would-look-pretty-tiny-in-modern-day-tokyo">a bit silly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the modern city. Incidentally, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954">Godzilla</a></em> is a painstakingly accurate snapshot of a city that no longer exists. All the buildings Godzilla destroys were real buildings, down to the little shopping centers.
</li><li> A major point of criticism for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour">The Godzilla Power Hour</a></em> was that Godzilla's size varied greatly within scenes, such that Godzilla could carry the entire ship with two hands while a human character can just barely fit in his palm in a later shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries">Godzilla: The Series</a></em> was a little better about it, but sometimes you'd have some smaller monsters that look about rhino-sized when chasing humans, and then balloon to ten times bigger when fighting Godzilla.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2000">Godzilla 2000</a></em>, in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromaKey">Chroma Key</a> scenes, manages to occasionally do this to Godzilla <em>in the same shot</em>. This is caused by having the screen portions with the human characters zoom in/out or move at different rates from the screen portions with Godzilla.
</li><li> In the Roland Emmerich / Dean Devlin 1998 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> and other critics noted, Zilla constantly changes size within the film as well. There is one notable shot where Zilla's eye opens in a tunnel, and it's several times taller than the soldier on screen, but later, when Zilla's head is in the same frame as Nick, its eye is about two feet in diameter.
<ul><li> Having the film consistently get Zilla's size wrong is ironic for a movie whose tag-line on the movie poster was "Size Does Matter".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em> mostly averts this, though there is one scene where Godzilla is standing next to the Golden Gate Bridge, and the water only comes up to his hips, with him appearing much bigger in the scene (he's supposed to be 108 metres tall, but just the water underneath the bridge is deeper than that, meaning he wouldn't even have broken the surface standing up, never mind towered over the bridge itself).
<ul><li> The two MUTO in the film also are subject to this trope, at least relative to each other. The shot where they first meet has the Female MUTO tower over her smaller mate, being roughly three times his size. Later, when they team up against Godzilla to defend their nest, the male now appears to be just slightly smaller than the female (though it's difficult to tell in some shots because of his wings, which the female lacks).
</li></ul></li><li> As covered by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQaaSCJyOLs&amp;list=PLMHInKRo4S7X_d_0VmfGIAH3_5zQTS8BV&amp;index=4">wikizilla<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the Kaiju stats have been very inconsistent from source to source.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingKong">King Kong</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ditto King Kong, who was able to straddle the World Trade Center and loom over the skyline of New York in the posters for the 1976 and 1933 movies, but was somewhere around 20 feet tall in the film, tops. The 1976 poster is especially ridiculous because he's depicted straddling the Twin Towers, which were about 200 feet apart in reality.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1976">1976 remake</a>, Kong's size varies quite dramatically from scene to scene, most likely for the same reason. It has been said that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">King Kong is as BIG as he needs to be</a>."
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933">the original</a>, he also gets bigger when he arrives in New York. So it's not so much "everything is bigger in America" as "America makes everything bigger"?

Most of the time she appears to be only two stories high, while in other times she stands almost as tall as an electric pylon, making her about 75 feet at least. As for the famous poster, there she seems to be between 150 and 200 feet.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Avoiding this</a> was a major concern of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em>, not only regarding the established height of these giant robots but regarding how they transform from their alternate mode into those giant robots. They had to fit inside their vehicle. Realistically Optimus Prime's original cab-over design would have resulted in a relatively small robot mode, and so they made him a full tractor rig in order to give him enough mass. Same thing with Bumblebee's change from a VW Beetle into a Camaro. They also had to play with Starscream's transformation scheme so that he didn't completely tower over every other robot, if it was similar to G1 Starscream he should have been upwards of 60 feet (18 m) tall. Still, there were some intentional shifts in scale, mostly in regards to being a visual cheat: Optimus was able to hold Sam and Mikaela in one hand and later pinched a pair of glasses between his fingers — the glasses would be over a foot (30 cm) long in comparison. Later films don't try as hard, or at least stretch it (Lockdown goes from a smallish sports car to being a little shorter than Optimus).

This was largely because they wanted to keep an extremely oversized shuttlebay (the original carried 2 while the new version had at least 10). The Abrams Enterprise was designed to be only moderately bigger than the original (280 meters to 360 tip of the saucer section to end of the nacelle) but the official statement for the movie is now is <em>700 meters</em>, about the same size as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Sovereign class Enterprise-E.</a> This has resulted in conflicting size comparisons between shots.

The reason for this is that the scene was originally shot in 1977 with an actor standing in for Jabba, but the scene was removed due to time and budget restraints. When Jabba finally showed up in <em>Jedi,</em> he was made much bigger than he would have been in the earlier deleted scene, so when that scene was re-instated, the <em>Jedi</em> Jabba design had to be downsized to fit into the set and choreography correctly.

For a long time, the Super Star Destroyer was listed as being 8 km long, while the Death Star II was 160 km across (only 40 km bigger than the first one). Sometime around the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, the books increased the size of the <em>Executor</em> to 19 and the Death Star II to a whopping 900. That said, going by the films, it seems the larger figures are more correct; indeed, the change was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">Truer to the Text</a> alteration, as fans had been saying for quite a while that the official numbers were far too small based on the films.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0opx8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0opx8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0opx8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In particular, the fact that the <em>Executor</em> is very obviously 11 to 12 times longer than the 1.6 km Imperial Star Destroyers in every shot that allows for a direct size comparison and yet was claimed by the guidebooks to be only 5 times longer was a long-time pet peeve of <em>Star Wars</em> geeks.Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, when the Executor crashes into the second Death Star, the horizon appears flat, suggesting the 900km figure is a lot more accurate</span> Later sources have cited the discrepancy to be the result of in-universe misinformation campaigns.

Both Gargantua and Pantagruel wildly vary in size, becoming whatever is needed for the story. For example, young Gargantua was able to ride common-sized horses and even visited a human brothel. However, usually he rides a horse which is the size of six elephants (making him 10-20 meters high). In another scene, cannonballs are tangled in his hair, and he mistakes them for fleas (making him 50+ m high). His son Pantagruel is able to argue law in a courtroom, making him probably 10 m high at the most. However, he fights with a ship's mast, making his height closer to 50 meters. And later it turns out that there's a human city inside his mouth, which means he must be hundreds of kilometers tall!

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleInRubberSuits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleInRubberSuits">rubber suits</a> for the Zords are the same size even when the mecha, as seen in effects shots, aren't. Bear with us for this one, 'cause it's sort of hard to explain quickly or without the names:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Power Rangers Dino Thunder</a></em> (adapted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger">Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger</a></em>), the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> is the Thundersaurus Megazord, whose three component mecha (called Dino Zords) fit inside the gigantic Brachiozord. One of the Thundersaurus' attacks involves sliding down Brachio's tail... something that would be impossible if the Thundersaurus was the size it would have to be if it's formed from the Dino Zords (given the size the individual Dino Zords are when seen leaving Brachio.) In other words, when doing this attack, Thundersaurus apparently shrinks from being larger than Godzilla to being about two car-lengths. Also, additional Zords are also seen being released from Brachio, at a size that makes it impossible that they could all fit inside Brachio at once. There are even scenes in <em>Abaranger</em> that showed <em>all</em> the <em>many</em> Dino Zords inside Brachio's inner compartment... something that would require Brachio to be at least five times bigger than the size it's seen to be when <em>alongside</em> other Dino Zords.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue</a>,</em> the Lightspeed Megazord is the main formation. When the Rail Rescues (giant train cars that carry the Lightspeed Megazord's component mecha) form the Super Train Megazord, and it's seen in relation to the Lightspeed, the Lightspeed looks like a ten-year-old standing next to Daddy. However, when both are in the same fight, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> is the same height as Lightspeed when in a shot with Lightspeed, and the same height as the Super Train when in a shot with the Super Train.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em> outdoes Brachio in terms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a>-ness. The Delta Squad Megazord is the main formation, about the size of the other seasons' main formations (such as the Lightspeed and Thundersaurus Megazords.) Its components, the five Delta Runners, are released from the interior of the base, a building comparable in size to other downtown buildings, and we've seen enough of its interior to account for a great deal of its interior space. It's revealed that the base has its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> formations, one humanoid, one vehicle. When releasing the Delta Runners while in its vehicle formation, we get to see where they're stored — and they take up the entirety of the base's interior. Even if all we've seen of the base's interior is all there is, making it so that people only occupy a few floors... there's just no way. And <em>later,</em> new jet-based Zords are introduced, and launched from the base in its <em>standard building formation,</em> and when it opens to release them, the base appears to be <em>entirely hollow.</em> Even if the jets are primarily stored in the underground hangar we find out about later on, there's <em>no way</em> the place they're launched from and the building's interior can coexist. Apparently, 90% of SPD's Earth headquarters exists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">Hammerspace</a>. The funniest thing is, that the SPD control room has a console that looks suspiciously <a class="urllink" href="http://nyappyranger.tumblr.com/post/15155671908/doctor-who-easter-eggs-in-power-rangers-the">like a TARDIS console.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Probably the series' greatest offender is Serpenterra. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, Serpentera is <strong>immense</strong>, making the Rangers' Megazords look like humans in comparison. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em>, Serpenterra has noticeably shrunk, as Cole seems to be the same size the Red Dragon Thunderzord was.
</li><li> A classic scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> has an overgrown Goldar reaching for an escaping bus. The bus is the size of a matchbox compared to Goldar's hand. The very next shot shows Goldar toying with the bus, now about same size as Goldar's own fore-arm.
</li><li> The most widespread and egregious case of this, and is an issue combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowAccuracyToyAccuracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowAccuracyToyAccuracy">Show Accuracy/Toy Accuracy</a>, is with humanoid Zords in general. Whether they're individual components or whole Megazords, humanoid Zords have a uniform general height shared with each other, such that a single humanoid Zoid is the same height as the whole Megazord it is a part of, even if it shouldn't be. This is a highlighted example of the mass shifting that Zords tend to do when combining together. The biggest case is when two Megazords, sometimes more, combine into a single one. This is especially true of much earlier Sentai starting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujuuSentaiLiveman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujuuSentaiLiveman">Choujuu Sentai Liveman</a></em>, when the practice was started, due to not having CGI and a uniform height on suits (before they got ridiculous like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">RPM Ultrazord</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Samurai Gigazord</a>) at the time. Depending on the nature of the combination, you could end up with two robots that are more or less the same height combining in a way that the components of one should add significant height to the other (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KousokuSentaiTurboranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KousokuSentaiTurboranger">Super Turbo Robo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman">Great Icarus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinpuuSentaiHurricaneger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinpuuSentaiHurricaneger">Gourai Senpuujin, and by proxy, Tenrai Senpuujin</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">Bakuretsu and Gigant Kyoryuzin</a>), and yet the end result is that the suit of the new combination isn't that much taller than either of its components, when comparing to the size of the monster it is fighting. One could say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a> ought to be applied here, since the only way to replicate individual humanoid Zords being smaller than its Megazord combination is if the suit actors were child-sized. This has mostly less prevalent in later series, with the advent for CGI, especially for multi-combinations, but it still happens for individual humanoid components and individual Megazords.

The introduction of Primaris Space Marines, who are bigger and stronger than their brothers, makes the scale even wonkier.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Toys </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The relative scale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> characters varies wildly from medium to medium.
<ul><li> A very early example is a Nesquik cereal TV ad (since promotional CDs were given away in cereal boxes back then), in which Toa Tahu appears among a group of human kids, and seems to be about as tall as a normal adult. According to official supplementary story material, he is actually about 7 and a half feet tall.
</li><li> The infamous introduction scene from the movie <em>The Legend Reborn</em> has a supposedly 40 million feet tall Mata Nui robot looking considerably shorter when standing, not even reaching out of the planet's atmosphere. This robot and its smaller prototype also caused a lot of head-scratching for comic illustrators, since they had to appear small enough to fit into pictures with normal-sized characters.
</li><li> Even when it came to the toys, scale issues still arose when comparing older figures to newer ones. The original toys were short and stout, while later, more articulated figures used longer limbs and larger body pieces, and thus became taller themselves, even though they were supposed to be the same size as their ancestors. This was only ever addressed in the '08 storyline, in which it was explained that an energy source caused the Light Matoran to grow larger than normal. Just to let you know how things changed since the line's debut in '01: the small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeople">Matoran</a> had grown to be almost as big as the original Toa toys. In turn, the first Toa sets only reach up to the later Toa figures' waist.
</li><li> The movie <em>Web of Shadows</em> tops all these examples. In it, the relative scale of the characters varies from scene to scene. According to the toys, the Visorak spiders are about as big as the Toa. The movie enlarged them quite a bit, but that's no big deal. However in one shot, a Visorak walks through a hall filled with Matoran-imprisoning spheres, and is no larger than those. Yet those spheres are small even compared to the Toa. Later Sidorak appears, and is the same size as the Visorak from earlier (his toy is at least two or three times its size, though). This would mean that Sidorak is the size of a puny Matoran, but that can't be, as he towers over the Toa, who in turn rise way above a regular Matoran's height. Then Keetongu appears. At first, his size compared to the Toa is about the same as the scale of their toys, as in, Keetongu's just slightly taller. But in a later scene, the immense Sidorak only comes up to his waist (thanks to some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedPerspective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedPerspective">Forced Perspective</a>)! Yet if we take the toys, Sidorak is supposed to be taller by about two heads. Finally, in the last scene, even the short Norik reaches up to Keetongu's waist, which would be impossible, given that Norik is same size as a Matoran! His figure doesn't even come up to Keetongu's knees, by the way.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015">2015 reboot</a> has the Lord of Skull Spiders: several times the size of the heroes in the web animations, hardly reaches beyond their knees in toy-form.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> toy sizes vary depending on how popular they think the character will be. In general within a line they try to be relevant to the real world scale, ie the smaller toys are motorcycles and cars, medium toys are trucks and tanks and larger toys are planes and heavy construction vehicles, but it is never consistent and you sometimes have a fighter jet character the same size as a tank character.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> and the corresponding Beast Era was all over the place in terms of relative scale, some of it obvious like Rattrap being a rat the size of a large dog or Megatron being a T-Rex who is almost equal in height to Optimus Primal as a gorilla. Given the lack of modern humans, the closest we get is that large cat characters like Cheetor and Tigatron are indistinguishable from their counterparts in nature. The toys themselves never really had a chance, as in the show Dinobot was taller than Optimus while being a medium sized toy and Optimus was one of the largest.
</li><li> The Alternators brand was advertised for not only realistic car modes but were intended to be in scale with each other. This didn't last long, but it was one of the first attempts to be more conscientious of this issue.
</li><li> The 2018 Studio Series line of toys was meant to be a re-release of characters across the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a>, and they explicitly said that their goal was primarily to maintain scale consistency <em>with the robot modes</em>, which meant that despite the inconsistencies with vehicle mode scale the robots would all be about the right height to each other. Thus Jazz is shorter than Bumblebee, who is shorter than Ratchet, despite all being deluxe class toys.

In the boss battle preceding it, however, he's enormous.
</li><li> Bowser Jr. himself has changed sizes throughout games. In <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, he's smaller than Mario. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, he's just slightly taller than Mario. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, he is as tall as, if not taller than, Peach. He shrinks back down to his <em>Sunshine</em> size for spinoffs, though. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em> Bowser Jr. is the same height as Larry and Wendy, the middle-height Koopalings. He's overshadowed by Roy, Iggy and Morton (<em>especially</em> Morton, he's HUGE). Jr.'s pretty stocky, however, taking after Bowser, Morton and Roy in that regard.
</li><li> Princess Peach's size has also slowly increased over time. She used to be much smaller than Mario post Super Mushroom. These days, she's about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller">One Head Taller</a> than him in the same state. Heck, she's even taller than Luigi nowadays. They apparently averted this for her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em>, which, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, is the reason Peach wasn't playable, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">the infamous skirt issue</a> (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/16/miyamoto-on-the-new-mario?page=3">source here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>):
<div class="indent"><em>"I thought it'd be nice to have her as a playable character, but the Toad characters had a similar physique to a Mario character than Peach does."</em>
</div></li><li> The size excuse apparently didn't hold water when Peach became a playable character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>; her size problem was addressed by shrinking her down a little bit so that she would have the same proportions as the Mario Bros. and the Toads, thus allowing everyone to have the same sized hit box.
</li><li> They actually went and explained this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>. Bowser's adrenaline makes him randomly grow to kaiju sizes from time to time, though in the game it only kicks in during extreme emergencies and it's the only way to save his life. And now in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, it repeats. Bowser is now really huge (he's big enough to stomp all over Toad Town, and for Peach to fit in the palm of his hand) and he's shown sitting on a castle as a throne. But in this case it's justified as coming from the power of the Grand Stars; whenever Mario beats one out of him he shrinks to normal size. And the Sun appearing at the end of the final level of the first <em>Galaxy</em>. When Mario arrives there, it's huge and full of holes, and his final battle with Bowser even takes place inside that Sun, but when Bowser is defeated, he is seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay">standing on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection">the Sun's surface,</a> except that the Sun is now smaller and no longer hollow!
</li><li> And the castle at the end of World 4 in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros</a></em>. When Mario beats World 4-3, the castle is huge, but at the start of World 5, the castle is tiny!
</li><li> Similar to Bowser, Petey Piranha is pretty inconsistent in his size. In his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> he was as big as a small house. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em>, Petey is much smaller, but still larger than every other character. His size grows again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>
</li><li> King Boo. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>, he's the size of a normal Boo. In later games, his size varies between being a bit bigger than Mario/Luigi (aka small enough to drive a go-kart and play sports) and absolutely massive. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a></em>, he is shown to be capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sizeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sizeshifter">sizeshifting</a>.
</li><li> Rosalina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em> is shown to be at least as tall as Peach's normal tall size. In the game's ending, Rosalina is shown to be a <em>giant</em> because she's almost like a god. In the spin off games like <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>, Rosalina is still slightly taller than Peach, but is around the same general size of the whole cast to keep things consistent. Rosalina appears to be much smaller when she became a playable character in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>, being the same height as Peach in that game</span>.
</li><li> In the overworld scenes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em>, the Zeekeeper is shown to only be about twice as big as the main characters, with his height likely being about 12 foot or so. In his boss battle? He's big enough to go toe to toe with Giant Luigi, who's about the size of a skyscraper. Might be justified by him being an actual deity in the story.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's endgame bosses are famously big, but what is egregious is how characters who are the size of players when you meet them in quests grow several times larger when you fight them, or fight alongside them. Tirion Fordring is usually the size of other humans, but stands three times as tall in the Icecrown Citadel raid. Illidan in the Black Temple looms over players, and so do the player's allies Akama and Maiev, who are normal-sized when you meet them in the outdoor world. A similar thing happens with Thrall and Jaina in the Mount Hyjal raid.
</li><li> This is usually handwaved as a game mechanic. Important characters intended to be fought by players are usually scaled to make them easier to find and target without visual obstruction: 5-man bosses may be <em>slightly</em> bigger than normal trash mobs, while 25-party bosses are very large. Even the faction leaders, who can be killed by enemy players, are slightly bigger than their generic counterparts. When you've got 25-40 people all trying to fight something, making it the same size as the people involved is just going to lead to pain.
</li><li> While player characters have their size set by their race/gender combo, the pets of hunter players grow as they gain levels. Additionally, some large pets like Devilsaurs, which are essentially tyrannosaurs and taller than many buildings, will shrink to a more manageable "slightly bigger than the largest playable races" size when tamed.
</li><li> Player can temporarily change their characters' size with various spells and items, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=78473">this endgame weapon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Usually considered fun flavor effects, they are sometimes used to mark out a particular player, such as the main tank, in raids.
</li><li> The Siege of Orgrimmar has a very visible example after the final boss. Garrosh and Thrall appear three times their usual height during the battle<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13h64');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13h64" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13h64');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Garrosh grows larger throughout the battle until most races only come up to his <em>ankle</em></span>, but in the following cinematic and after-battle scene are their normal height again.
</li></ul></li><li> This shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em> as well, with Heroes being arbitrarily larger than normal units (seriously, compare the Paladin to the Peasant; ho-lee shit). There's pretty good odds that it's something to do with the Warcraft Universe itself; wherein size is actually a good indicator of power, and as characters become more powerful they <em>actually grow bigger</em>.
</li><li> The size of the Titans has been rather inconsistent. They were originally implied to be big, but still small enough to interact with humans (maybe 100 feet tall or so), as Sargeras was trapped in the Tomb Of Sargaras in the third game. Later on, they would be depicted as literally the size of planets, with Sargeras cutting entire planets in half with his sword. Even more insane: <a class="urllink" href="https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/2/2c/Pantheon_Chronicle.jpg">this picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> shows just their <em>heads</em> as the size of nebulae (which vary from a few AU across to over a light year), although this part can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> as just a cool picture and not an accurate representation of their size. They later retconned it so the thing in the Tomb Of Sargeras was really just an avatar of some sort.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em>, all characters are scaled to be about the same size, apart from a few exceptions (Azmodan, Deathwing, Cho'gall are noticablybigger, 2 of the lost vikings are smaller), resulting in large devil equivalents Diablo and Mephisto, giant firelord Ragnaros, and a siege tank, among others, being human sized or slightly larger in the Nexus.
</li><li> A inversion of the usual: Jocinda Smith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em> is supposed to be rather short. When you actually play as her, she's one of the tallest on the field.
</li><li> Ridley from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> is about as inconsistent in his size as Bowser.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">the first game</a> for the NES, he was only the size of Samus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">His next appearance</a> establishes him as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBigger">bigger than his adversary</a>, but still nonetheless one of the smallest bosses in the game (only just slightly larger than Torizo!). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Zero Mission</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of the first game, makes him a little bigger than Super Metroid but not by much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> make him even larger than before, but now have explanations for it. In <em>Metroid Prime 3</em>, his largest appearance yet, depicts him as a total gargantuan monster that's large enough to have Samus fit in his mouth. When he reappears later on at the Pirate Homeworld, suddenly he shrinks back to his size as Meta Ridley in the first <em>Metroid Prime</em> game!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> is an interesting case. During the fight with him at the Geothermal Power Plant, he's large enough to hold Samus in one hand, but that's mostly because not only are his hands <em>huge</em>, but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean">he's now depicted as being a lot bulkier than before</a>. He's still big, though. They actually had to <em>create</em> a new, larger model for him whenever he tried to grind Samus against the wall.
</li><li> This also applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>. In the introduction FMV to <em>Melee</em>, he was only slightly larger than Samus, comparable to his appearance in <em>Super Metroid</em>. In <em>Brawl</em> he's about twice her size. When he reappears as Meta-Ridley, he's suddenly smaller than he was before, although still larger than the player character him/herself. After being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, he's shrunken back to his <em>Super Metroid</em> size.
</li><li> Kraid, one of the Space Pirate generals, has this even worse. In his first appearance, he was the size of Samus. In <em>Super Metroid</em>, he was the size of the <em>screen</em> and then some. As with Ridley above, <em>Zero Mission</em> cements his canon size to be the same as <em>Super Metroid</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em> series, every member of the royal family varies in size from level to level. The cousins are the most obvious, as they can go from being a few centimeters tall to a kilometer in height to better suit the scale of the level they're in. The King of All Cosmos himself can either stand on the Earth and tower at about 3000 kilometers, or he can be several orders of magnitude larger than the Earth itself.
</li><li> Much like the anime, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> games often do this, but at least once they manage to do it within the same game. As an example, <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/yw404jsp2g8?t=5s">Beelzemon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/yw404jsp2g8?t=1m30s">Gallantmon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are both roughly the same size (around six foot or 1.8 m, based on the buildings) in the opening cutscene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3">Digimon World 3</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, the Master Chief's size varies in cutscenes. In cutscenes rendered by the game's engine, he looks to be about seven feet (213 cm) tall (his canonical height in armor is 7'2" or 219 cm). In cutscenes rendered by Blur, he's even larger in comparison to the other characters; Commander Palmer (at 6'9" or 206 cm) doesn't even come up to his shoulder, and he absolutely dwarfs unaugmented human characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> King K. Rool was huge and pretty much twice as tall and wide as Donkey Kong. When he appeared again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a></em>, his size was redone so he was at least tall or slightly taller than Donkey Kong while still being very bulky. The new size became K. Rool's standard appearance in all future incarnations.
</li><li> Donkey Kong himself was pretty small in the SNES trilogy with being nearly the same size as Diddy probably because to avoid any hitbox disadvantages, in later games he's seen much bigger than his little buddy.
</li><li> Before you free him, K. Lumsy, a giant reptile in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, is held in a cage in a room on an island. The cage is not exactly spacious, but it's not a tight fit, either. Once you <em>do</em> free him, he looks like he should be too large for the <em>island</em>, never mind the <em>cage</em>. The island itself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a>. How K. Lumsy was able to get inside the island in the first place (and later leave it) only brings up further questions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Robo Manus</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> was at least twice as tall as the 'Toads in the NES game and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a></em> crossover, but the Game Boy game made him a bit taller. This was taken to extremes in the arcade game where he is listed as being over 76 feet tall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8">Mega Man 8</a></em>, Frost Man was one of the largest Robot Masters in the series and towered over Mega Man. When he appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em>, he's no longer the behemoth he once was but is still one of the largest Robot Masters. The change in size was because <em>8</em> uses 32-bit graphics to show the characters with moderately proportioned sizes, while <em>10</em> intentionally reverted back to the classic 8-bit graphics used throughout most of the series that forced characters to all match in size. <em>Mega Man: The Power Battle</em> and <em>Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</em> use a similar effect with many of their returning Robot Masters, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Guts Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5">Stone Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">Centaur Man</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> games had a strange case of this. While most of the characters were all different sizes in cutscenes, everyone is the same size in actual gameplay. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that it was due to the technical limitations of the Unreal 3 engine. Apparently they had problems where larger races, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">krogan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">salarians </a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans">turians</a> would get stuck in the terrain, so they just decided to make everyone the same size.
<ul><li> Also, while it's not exactly a character, both versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">the Normandy</a> change size quite a bit throughout the series. One of the more notable examples is during the end of the second game, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Joker</a> brings the Normandy in to extract the squad <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">off of the exploding Collector Base after killing the Human Reaper larvae</span>. Normally the forward section of the Normandy looks to be about 25 feet tall, give or take. In this case, it doesn't appear to be much taller then Joker, who's standing by the door for scale during most of the cutscene.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand3">Wario Land 3</a></em>, Rudy the Clown is absolutely massive, standing about five times Wario's height and being big enough to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundBoss">Background Boss</a> in a 2D platformer. In <em>Dr Mario 64</em>? He's suddenly roughly human sized.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>: In-game, even the children of Soleanna are visibly taller than Sonic, but in cutscenes, he stands only slightly shorter than Princess Elise, who herself seems of average height for a young lady her age.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>: Shale was originally planned to be as big as the various NPC golems encountered throughout the story, but had to be shrunk down considerably due to problems with having a playable character that large (notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">she couldn't fit through doors</a>). However, a few cutscenes rendered before the change was made still show her at her original size. For example, the scene where she's first awakened has a shot where she towers over the rest of your party at nearly twice their height before reverting to her normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller">One Head Taller</a> appearance when the dialogue begins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pirate101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pirate101">Pirate 101</a></em>: Most of the larger companions will appear only slightly larger than the player when not in combat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a></em>: Razorbeard's giant robot, Grolgoth, is at first shown to be at least 10 times larger than Rayman, and big enough for Razorbeard to be able to fit inside a small cockpit on Grolgoth's belly.

In one scene Dee Dee is as tall as a city building, but in another shot she's roughly the same height as the Eiffel Tower.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> has huge problems with this, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tfwiki.info/wiki/Scale">best left to a Wiki that can give it an article unto itself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Fan consensus about the size inconsistencies is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">Just ignore it</a>", as they're aware of the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> it would entail to explain it. Similarly, the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Combiners</a> like Devastator and Monstructor were originally depicted as being as large as their individual component robots stacked on top of each other, while by the time that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prowl</span> was made Devastator's head he was depicted as growing to several times his normal size in the process.
<ul><li> Notable examples from Generation 1 include a motorcycle transformer becoming as large as a helicopter when forming the leg of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, and one about the size of Optimus Prime being able to accommodate a Formula One racer on each of his legs. Robots that transformed into <em>transformer-scale cities</em> were often shown to be no larger than the rest of their fellows <em>who were supposed to be able to fit comfortably inside them</em>. In "Carnage in C-Minor," Scrapper and Hook become small enough for Ultra Magnus to pick one up in each hand and bash their heads together. The list goes on.
</li><li> Astrotrain deserves special mention. He transforms from a 21 m (70') locomotive (shown to be normal sized compared to others) to a 56 m (184') shuttle (assuming a real life shuttle) — or into an even bigger shuttle, as witnessed by his ability to carry an entire Decepticon team inside of him — including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Devastator</a>. And yet Astrotrain's robot mode is as tall as Megatron.
</li><li> Broadside, another Triple Changer, makes things even stranger. His alt-modes are a moderately large space jet and an entire <em>aircraft carrier</em>, which is probably the single biggest scale disparity in G1. Broadside's robot mode is even more confusing; depending on the time of day, he can be anywhere from as tall as Springer (like his toy) to as tall as Ultra Magnus (which is easy to fit into shots) to as tall as Devastator (which is mostly a concession towards an aircraft carrier's real size).
</li><li> To make a long story short-ish: Transformers tend to be just the size the plot needs them to be, and the sizes of robot modes in relation to vehicle modes don't always add up, with small cars and jumbo jets turning into robots of the same height in the original series. Any robot whose purpose isn't to carry others (and some who are, in the case of Astrotrain) will be this standard size. As for the carrier robots, they're often bigger, but not big enough to account for their great interior space... which is also subject to change based on who's inside. The planet-sized Transformers have the same problem of being inconsistent or huge-but-not-huge-enough: standard Transformers look like ants at a distance that <em>should</em> render them invisible, unless Megatron's the size of Rhode Island. Later series at least <em>try</em> when it comes to scale — notice <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> Starscream towering over everyone but Megatron (and the Decepticons in general are bigger because they transform into aircraft instead of cars), and movie Starscream being almost triangle-shaped so he won't — but still have problems.
</li><li> Also, there's the matter of <em>specific parts of a bot while transforming.</em> The half of Bumblebee's car mode that becomes his feet shrinks as the rest of him seems to grow out of it, so he won't be as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chibi">Chibi</a> as the keychain-sized toy he's inspired by. Other times, the feet remain the size of the car-half they're formed from as the rest of him just grows and grows and grows out of it.
<ul><li> There are worse cases. Omega Supreme has a sort of dual-vehicle mode, as a train (with track) that's much smaller than the rocket that's composed of just his forearms. When the rocket takes off, the train and track disappears, to reappear when he lands.
</li></ul></li><li> True to form, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> features this as well. It's like they aren't even trying to hide this, as Arcee transforms into a standard motorcycle and yet fills up Jack's garage in robot mode. <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/6/6c/DarknessRising3-Arceesizechange.jpg">Just look at her!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> Especially amusing given <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em>, where Arcee (a human-scaled motorcycle in this series as well) was frequently alongside <em>its</em> main human sidekick, and was barely a couple heads taller than he.
</li><li> The fact that Megatron, Soundwave, and the cassettes change size drastically when they transform indicates that Transformers obviously have some sort of technology to change mass and volume. Therefore it's reasonable to assume that they all possess this ability to one degree or another. Still doesn't explain the characters who are <em>smaller</em> than they should be, like the Seekers.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/rMrku7Z.jpg">This image<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> does a pretty good job of showing the problem. Of note is the largest character seen: Scout-class Depthcharge, whose toy comes up to Bumblebee's waist, transforms into a seventy-meter corvette boat. A scale-accurate robot mode would be about the size of Mechagodzilla.
</li><li> Later shows tend to make efforts to avert this, by avoiding or reworking characters with too-large or too-small modes (Soundwave rarely turns into a tape deck nowadays, and there hasn't been a shuttleformer in animation since <em>Armada</em>'s Jetfire) and designing characters so they're much larger or smaller if their altmode warrants it (motorcycle Prowl in <em>Animated</em> is pretty short and slender, while bomber jet Lugnut is a massive bruiser). In general, you can expect cars to be "average", motorcycles to be smaller, and trucks, tanks, and jets to be varying degrees of bigger. Being <em>Transformers</em>, though, the effort given is nowhere near enough to actually work — but hey, they're trying!
</li><li> A lot of the scale issues from <em>Transformers</em> comes from the simple fact that it's unapologetically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>, and keeping to a precise scale would seriously limit the kind of vehicles that could be turned into toys. If the car toys were six inches long, for instance, then the only other cost-effective toys would be of three-inch motorbikes, eight-inch truck cabs or armored vehicles, and maybe eleven-inch tanks, and any fighter jet toys would come out being about two feet long and likely cost hundreds of dollars (to say nothing of helicopters, boats, trains, construction vehicles, larger planes, space shuttles...). The <em>Alternators</em> and <em>Human Alliance</em> lines, which completely averted this trope in favor of sticking to a strict 1/24 scale, ran into exactly this problem, as the only modes to easily fit into that scale were cars and smaller trucks. Because of this, the toyline tends to make most of the cast about the same size (though characters with large altmodes tend to be somewhat bigger), and the fiction tends to follow suit... which results in the above.
</li><li> Disregarding the altmode issues, most series have more conventional issues with giants. For instance, in the original cartoon, Optimus is usually shown in scale charts and the like to be around six meters tall, which is actually fairly accurate to his altmode. However, he also routinely becomes big enough to catch a human in the palm of his hand or small enough to fit inside a building.

In one scene, his head is slightly bigger than Bugs, but later Bugs is able to enter the giant's ear and gets lost in his hair. Most egregious of all is the scene near the end when Bugs goes down an elevator built into the beanstalk and tells the giant to take the stairs. For this one scene the giant has somehow shrunk down to be only about two or three times as tall as Bugs!
</li><li> Also in <em>Hot Cross Bunny</em> the head scientist's height varies throughout the short; sometimes he's like two feet taller than Bugs and other times he's a foot shorter than him.
</li><li> In <em>Bugsy and Mugsy</em>, Bugs creates a hole in the floor of a condemned apartment. He's his usual size when outside the hole, but inside he's around the size of a mouse, which is especially noticeable when he's carrying a magnet almost as big as him.

But the official heights of the students are still not consistent. Kirishima, who is 5'7" is often drawn as around the same height as (and sometimes even taller than) Todoroki, who is 5'10". Whereas Iida, who is only half an inch over Todoroki, apepras to be huge. Even Yaoyorozu, who, at 5'8" should be taller than Kirishima, occasionally appears to be shorter than him.

Most jarring of all, Grabowski (a mouse) fits comfortably into a bottle that one of the rats drank empty in one scene, and later stands face to face with him, coming up to the rat's shoulder.

And some shots carry that idea through, like showing them barely fitting in table seats and using knives and forks that are clearly too big for them. But then other shots seem to depict them as human-size; in particular, either they're human-sized when interacting with the mice, or the mice are closer in scale to beetles.

<ul><li> Foreign translations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> simply <em>cannot</em> agree on Gollum's size. Sometimes they keep him about the same size as Bilbo, sometimes (such as in the Japanese translation), he's <em>enormous</em>, much larger even than a human.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins">The Moomins</a> and other characters in the original books don't seem too concerned with maintaining the same size, though you may miss it if you don't pay attention. Sometimes they seem to be much smaller than you'd think from visual adaptations, where they've been kind of standardized. An obvious example is when they trap the ant lion in <em>Finn Family Moomintroll</em>; it's dangerous and could eat them, and an illustration shows its head being bigger than Moomintroll, but right after that, they capture it in a jar.
</li><li> <em>Roland Rat: Living Legend</em> seems to have its rodent characters the size of actual rats (Roland's grandfather can sit on Anton de Farcey's shoulder; the "rodent maternity ward" of the hospital is a broom cupboard, with dusters for beds), except when it occasionally remembers that in the TV shows, the puppets are about four feet tall.

The relative sizes of Kay and the various Midnight Folk is never nailed down, and seems to vary according to convenience. Whenever Kay is hanging out with animals, he's apparently about the same size as they are, and when his toys are out and about, they seem to be life-size. There is one occasion on which Kay explicitly shrinks, in order to go on a voyage in a model ship crewed by mice, but even then there are times in the voyage where Kay seems to be his normal size again and the ship and mice have implicitly grown to match.

When she's standing on her hind legs next to Wombat, she comes up about to his waist, but when he picks her up and carries her or she perches on his hat, she's a fair bit smaller.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows">The Wind in the Willows</a></em>, the animals at first seem to be about the size you expect, until they get affected by Toad's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">Anthropomorphic Shift</a>, and are suddenly the right size for operating a horse-drawn caravan. Then later, Ratty and Mole can both comfortably fit inside a hollow tree, while Toad is crashing motor cars and having extensive adventures in the human world.
</li><li> Ozma's size in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> is inconsistent, even when drawn by the same artist. John R. Neill is the artist of most of L. Frank Baum's <em>Oz</em> books but his Ozma either towered over Dorothy or was the same height as Dorothy.

In most games after he's only a couple of heads taller than Crash and dwarfed by Cortex's previous powerhouses such as Tiny.

Cheese tends to be larger in 3D, however. This also applies to the Chao in general as a species, having grown slightly larger with time in 3D graphics while remaining tiny with 2D graphics, though Cheese has the biggest variation among them.

The parakeets in the bird cafe look normal-sized, but a Chukar Partridge is able to overpower the human heroine, three pigeons are able to physically intimidate her, and a finch is able to give the heroine a ride on a scooter. A rock dove is also able to drag the heroine along, but at the same time her human physical strength is prized by the other birds (which she can grab and throw out of the window as punishment) and she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">an outrageously high Vitality stat</a>. There is also a scene where Hiyoko thinks the defeathered corpse of a dove is "either a chicken or a turkey", implying it's somewhere between those two sizes.

However, that particular episode was about how he hates that he is short and longs to be taller, so it may have been done for that reason.
