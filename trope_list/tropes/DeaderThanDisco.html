<p></p><div class="indent"><strong>Angelica:</strong> Aunt Didi, what's disco? <br/><strong>Didi:</strong> Oh, nothing, sweetheart. It's something that happened a long time ago and it's never, never coming back, so don't you worry.

But at some point, it somehow just got too popular. It was talked about on <em>every</em> radio station, on <em>every</em> TV network, in <em>every</em> chat room. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">overexposed until people got bored with it</a>, and it got so much publicity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">so many bad imitators</a> that there was plenty of time to notice each and every flaw and dissect them under a microscope. Soon, small insignificant flaws become regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">unavoidable and unforgivable sins</a>. The final tell-tale sign is ridicule or even hatred, coming not just for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">the thing itself</a> but for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater">the people who like it</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">They become the subject of nasty, highly-specific stereotypes</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GushingAboutShowsYouLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GushingAboutShowsYouLike">gushing about liking it</a> online, even if meant completely sincerely, is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a>.

It may get revived decades later as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">Bile Fascination</a>, but it's unlikely to be popular on its own merits ever again.

</p><p>When all of this has happened, that thing which was once so full of life is not just dead; it's Deader than Disco.

It's particularly common with things that never had a cult following, to begin with — they went from nowhere to everything, and then back to nowhere, very suddenly. This is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> after something faded from popularity with the haters still remaining.

<ul><li> Once upon a time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> was one of the most profitable anime distributors in America, holding properties like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. While the company was always hated by the anime fandom due to their localization practices, which so heavily censored and edited titles to the point that they had little in common with the source material, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">properties were massively popular</a> amongst the general population. As time went on and the anime boom began to lose steam, 4Kids' fortunes took a drastic turn for the worse. After suffering two bankruptcies, being sold off to various other companies in pieces, and having all their biggest properties scattered across different companies, it's pretty safe to say that 4Kids is gone for good. While they <em>did</em> have some well-received properties in their day, today they're remembered mostly as "butchers" of various anime properties — particularly their disastrous localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>.

<ul><li> It's hard to imagine, but there was a time when Chuck Austen was a well-regarded figure and a legitimately popular up-and-comer in the world of comics. After a number of fits and starts, he was catapulted to fame by the twelve-issue miniseries <em>US War Machine</em>, which played on the mix of the manga boom and the popularity of mature comics to become a surprise hit. When he was placed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen">Uncanny X-Men</a></em>, running simultaneously with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s seminal <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen">New X-Men</a></em>, it was no surprise at all to readers. <br/><br/>The result? An utterly nonsensical story about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> being an actual demon and the conspiracy by the Catholic Church to appoint him as the Pope. An arc that served as a bizarre retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em> that featured rednecks wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and a midair public sex scene. The story where the Juggernaut pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and bangs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> for no reason. And the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> Annie Ghazikhanian (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization">based off his wife</a> Ann Austen, more known as a writer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> than anything else). Austen also had short runs on many other famous books, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em>, each time being chased off by increasingly irritated fans. He eventually jumped ship to DC, who handed him <em>Action Comics</em>, at which he proceeded to write a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">Derailing Love Interests</a> plot that pleased neither Lois fans nor Lana fans. It would be his last mainstream work, and he's since gone back to TV animation (which he'd been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">doing</a> before going into comics; strangely, perhaps because of him not writing them, the shows he's worked on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">been</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">successful</a>) under the name <em>Chuckles</em> Austen. Chris Sims <a class="urllink" href="http://comicsalliance.com/ask-chris-89-the-rise-and-fall-of-chuck-austen/">summed him up<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> thusly:
<div class="indent">"When you look at that crowd of new comics writers that was really making waves at the start of this century, guys like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Bendis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>, Austen was right in there with them, with four solid years as one of the most prominent writers in that crop of creators. And yet, the best thing you can say about Austens work in super-hero comics is that <em>occasionally</em>, it wasnt<em> absolutely terrible</em>."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>, while never a critical favourite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">was nevertheless considered one of the most successful writers/artists</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">The Dark Age of Comic Books</a>. He created several famous characters, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cable">Cable</a>. He also helped start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> and was influential through his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Youngblood">Youngblood</a></em>. However, after the Dark Age ended, he became a laughingstock for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyArtist">Lazy Artist</a> (not drawing feet, creating unrealistic and generic character designs, not caring about perspective or how the human body works, and overusing pouches), and for plagiarizing concepts from other people (for example, Deadpool started off as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a>). Today <em>Youngblood</em> is usually seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> (though the later revivals of the series in 1998, 2008, 2012 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood2017">2017</a> were better received) and even Liefeld himself considers the first few issues of the series to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> (though many have praised the <em>Youngblood</em> trade paperback for fixing many of the problems the original issues had) which is generally considered a poor rip-off of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, and Image has moved away from superhero comics like it. Cable and Deadpool are still popular, but that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy">thanks to other writers</a> who developed them in different ways than Liefeld and are generally considered their <em>true</em> creators by fans. What little goodwill Liefeld still had by the 2000s dried up after a much-publicized feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> after the latter revealed that the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shatterstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shatterstar">Shatterstar</a>, who had been created by Liefeld for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em> and was at the time being used by David in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, was bisexual. This move was very well-received by fans (and given Shatterstar's origins, seems fairly obvious in hindsight), but Liefeld was incensed that the move had been made without consulting him and many felt his comments on the subject were worryingly close to biphobic (though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a></em>'s numerous reviews of his comics didn't help). Nowadays, the only times you hear about Liefeld is mockery of his art-style or his lackluster characters, and comic book fans consider him to be the ultimate embodiment of everything wrong with The Dark Age Of Comics.

</p><ul><li> "Endgame", the famous 4-part supposed-to-have-been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, at one time was a popular storyline, with how the stakes seem to rise, culminating in a one-on-one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> between Sonic and Robotnik. However, due to a combination of time passing and the bad blood garnered towards writer Ken Penders in the wake of his lawsuit that led to the Archie series first undergoing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> and then being canceled entirely, many fans have begun to call it nothing more than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plot</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13">Gen13</a></em> was a massive hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm">WildStorm</a> back in the late nineties, being part of their holy trinity with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Stormwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Stormwatch">Stormwatch</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wildcats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wildcats">Wildcats</a></em>. It was also one of the first American comics to feature a lesbian character in a major role, in the form of Rainmaker. At its height, it spawned two spin-offs (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DV8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DV8">DV8</a></em> and <em>Bootleg</em>) and a number of crossovers and miniseries. Unfortunately, following the departure of co-creators Brandon Choi and J. Scott Campbell, the series was taken over by a succession of other creative teams who strayed far from the series' original lighthearted tone, and then hit its nadir when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> took over, forced his predecessor to kill off the original team, and replaced them with a new team made up of ethnic stereotypes. At the same time, Wildstorm itself was moving towards more adult-oriented work like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em>, and thus no longer saw its teen heroes as a priority. By the time Wildstorm rebooted itself with <em>Worldstorm</em>, the "Genies" had fallen so far out of the company's esteem that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a> was largely left to her own devices to reboot the franchise, resulting in a series that bore little connection to the rest of Worldstorm. Nowadays, the franchise is remembered mainly for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>-laden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> involving its teenage female characters, and with Wildstorm's old properties now under the control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a>, who is not known to be fond of the series, it is unlikely to see another revival any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Tintin">Tintin in the Congo</a></em> is one of the most infamous instances in Europe. Back in 1931, it was both a commercial and critical success within Belgium and the rest of Europe, spawning a franchise for decades to come. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, it was widely criticized, even among Tintin fans, for its portrayal of the Congolese people, who are drawn to look like monkeys and are depicted as stupid and infantile. Knowledge that the Belgian Congo was the scene of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State">rampant atrocities<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that have since been compared to various historical <em>genocides</em>, and which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">horrified even the other colonial powers</a>, doesn't help. Likewise, the fact that the hero hunts lots of the local wildlife is hard to enjoy now that many species of said wildlife are critically endangered. These scenes were modified in later editions so Tintin only scares the wildlife off instead of killing them. Also, it doesn't help that the story is quite crude compared to the intricate plots of later Tintin albums. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge">Hergé</a> himself later came to regard the story (along with its predecessor <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em>) as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>, calling it "bourgeois" and "paternalistic". Those who read it now do so chiefly for completeness or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">a historical relic of the colonial era</a>.
</li><li> Dreamwave's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersGenerationOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersGenerationOne">Transformers Generation One</a></em> comics went through this <em>hard.</em> When they were first announced, they had 'superstar manga-like artist' Pat Lee doing both all the promotions and a whole lot of art. The cast was straight from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> cartoon, coming during a period of 80s revival that ate those characters up like popcorn. It was advertised as a superb comeback, and sure enough, Dreamwave's entire original miniseries cracked the top ten in sales charts, with most issues even making it to #1. The success spread to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> comic as well, making it one of the only non-G1 comics to achieve mainstream success. They followed up with <em>Transformers: The War Within</em>, probably the most influential series to ever have Optimus Prime on the cover. Packaging art and merchandise of the time switched to a Dreamwave-esque style, and many of the designs of the various series (particularly <em>War Within</em>) would be incorporated into the following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a>.</em> <br/><br/>But even at the height of its popularity, Dreamwave had its detractors. Complaints about fanfic-y plots and a fetish for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">original 1984-85 cast</a> abounded, and the general feel of the line reeked of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">faux-maturity</a>. The artwork soon became one of the biggest complaining points, with "puffyformers" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a>" becoming common fandom terms to describe Pat Lee's art style (which all other artists on the payroll were forced to use). These complaints intensified with rumors that Pat Lee himself wasn't just a bad artist; he was a complete scumbag who refused to pay his employees, took credit from much better artists, and siphoned company funds into buying himself a Porsche. When Dreamwave went bankrupt from a mixture of flagging sales and Lee's embezzling, the public opinion of Dreamwave as a company flipped completely into "hate." Since then, aside from <em>War Within</em>, Dreamwave's books have pretty much vanished from the eyes of both the fandom and Hasbro (outside of the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Sunstorm</a> toy), and many of the writers and artists who got their start there seem to regard it as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>. Even <em>stylistically</em> resembling Dreamwave books (using mostly the '84/85 cast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">quoting</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em>, killing off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">Puny Humans</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots">GoBots</a>) is enough to get alarm bells going in some circles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em> was never lacking in detractors, but this was primarily <em>because</em> it was so big and popular; it was The Big Comic of 2004 That Everyone Was Talking About. Everywhere you went on comic sites, there were people debating over what it meant for the industry, whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">its tonal shift</a> boded darker stories, and whether the DCU would ever be the same again. But as the years ground on, the general opinion of <em>Identity Crisis</em> slipped from "controversial masterwork of our time" to "half-baked edgy fumble." Maybe it was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">few of the story threads actually went anywhere or weren't promptly ignored or retconned</a>, maybe it was how everyone tried to copy it at DC for a few years with increasingly weaker results (leading to very badly received stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">Countdown to Final Crisis</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack">Amazons Attack!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueCryForJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueCryForJustice">Justice League: Cry for Justice</a></em>), maybe it was that people started examining it and separating it from its hype and found that it was actually a very lacking story in many ways. Whatever it is, <em>Identity Crisis</em> has very few fans today, and whenever someone admits to remembering liking it, they'll usually be greeted by everyone else pointing out its plot holes.

<ul><li> The toothbrush mustache was once a very stylish look for men like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> during the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwentiethCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwentiethCentury">20th century</a>. Then along came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">a certain Austrian politician</a> donning that style (which Chaplin himself famously exploited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator">The Great Dictator</a></em>), and ruining it forever by association, to the point where the look is <em>still</em> widely known as the "Hitler mustache".
</li><li> Excessive artificial tanning (be it from spraying or using a bed) has gone out this way. Tanning had been very popular in the late 60s and 70s as well as the late 90s, and it was especially huge in the 2000s when spray tanning was massively popular with celebrities to achieve that sun-kissed glow. However, some took the practice <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3474768/The-WORST-fake-tan-fails-time-revealed-avoid-them.html">too far<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, resulting in no shortage of mockery. Moreover, thanks in part to an increased awareness of skin cancer and a resurgence of heavy makeup in the 2010s, tans are no longer seen as a prerequisite for beauty, as the popularity of paler skinned celebrities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristinaHendricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristinaHendricks">Christina Hendricks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">Robert Pattinson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, Dita Von Teese, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a> has shown. As demonstrated by the also DTD <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore">Jersey Shore</a></em> (and others), excessive tanning is now far more likely to be mocked than swooned over (as exemplified with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.revelist.com/politics/donald-trumps-fake-ass-tan/766">Donald Trump<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). The Kardashians, who continue to artificially bronze themselves, and their imitators, once had thousands who followed in their footsteps of tanning are now mocked for one of the same reasons that got them so big.
</li><li> The leisure suit became popular from the 1960s through the '70s when the abundance of synthetic materials, cheap prices, and a dislike for formality made it the fashion symbol for men. Its height of popularity was during the '70s when it was frequently associated with disco culture. But when disco, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">became dead</a>, the leisure suit went with it — and by the '80s, it was commonly considered emblematic of '70s kitsch. Today, it is little known for anything other than clueless fashion sense, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry">Leisure Suit Larry</a></em> video game series.
</li><li> Mullets were a common haircut throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> that tended to show up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHairEvilHair">heroic characters in media of this decade</a>. However, the '90s backlash against the coked-up excess of the '80s made the style a target of mockery, beginning with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeastieBoys">The Beastie Boys</a>' diss track of the style in 1993 (which originated the word 'mullet' — though not the hairstyle itself, which had been around since the '70s). While mullets have had occasional 'ironic' revivals from '80s fanatics and lovers of kitsch, the style nowadays is mostly associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">Lower Class Louts</a> in the popular imagination, far too irrevocably tainted to ever again be as sincerely cool as it was in 1985.

<ul><li> The 1999 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty">American Beauty</a></em> was a huge hit with both critics and audiences, winning five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a>, including Best Picture, in what is still acknowledged as a monumental year for Hollywood — and at the time, its wins were not at all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">controversial</a> even as it beat classic films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenMile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenMile">The Green Mile</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingJohnMalkovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingJohnMalkovich">Being John Malkovich</a></em>. Over the years, however, the film saw its reputation fall victim to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">product of its time</a> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">9/11 attacks</a> and the Great Recession making its concerns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstWorldProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstWorldProblems">seem trivial</a>, and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, it's been listed on more than a few "Most Overrated Films" lists. The #MeToo movement didn't do it any favors, either, making Lester's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">sexual interest in the teenage Angela</a> look far more problematic than it did in 1999 — especially given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSpacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSpacey">Kevin Spacey</a>, who played Lester, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">later himself the subject</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">career-ending allegations</a> that he had molested young men. Even its director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamMendes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamMendes">Sam Mendes</a> has stated that he believes the film got too much praise at the time. On the film's 20th anniversary, Matthew Jacobs <a class="urllink" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-beauty-legacy-20-years-later_n_5d5c344fe4b0d1e1136902be">wrote<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em>The Huffington Post</em>:
<div class="indent">"The profound ideas at which [this film] grasped now seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">passé at best</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">clueless at worst</a>.

The class depiction at the center seemed more like low-hanging snark than trenchant analysis. In a roundabout way, Sept. 11 was the beginning of the end for this sort of movie, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> luring 1970s Hollywood away from the once-prolific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">Western genre</a>."

Modern-day film scholars and critics are still more than willing to acknowledge <em>this</em> part of its legacy. However, to say that the film's writing and story has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">not aged well</a> (even though it's rated G)... well, there's a reason why it's only watched today by film students (for the technical/historical aspects) and by people studying the history of racism.

The original Klan never burned crosses or had a specific uniform, but thanks to <em>The Clansman</em> and later <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, they became indelibly linked with the organization and with white supremacy in general.</span>, a symbol of an ugly time in American history when open, virulent racism (in the name of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/reconciliation-movement">"reconciliation"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between North and South after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>) was not merely socially acceptable but considered a sign of proper values throughout the country.
</li><li> As discussed in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/gq-film-godfather-part-four">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Andy Morris for <em>GQ</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartIII">The Godfather Part III</a></em> received mostly positive reviews when initially released, with some critics like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneSiskel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneSiskel">Gene Siskel</a> and Alexander Walker ranking it among 1990's best. It also was a respectable box office success and earned seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and was generally considered a worthy follow-up to the first two <em>Godfather</em> films, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">perhaps not at their level</a>. Backlash began soon afterwards, however, triggered by multiple sources: criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SofiaCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SofiaCoppola">Sofia Coppola</a>'s performance, press coverage of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3i5o4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3i5o4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3i5o4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Coppola himself would specifically blame Peter J.

Being shut out at the Oscars intensified the criticism. The final nail in the coffin was, ironically enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodFellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodFellas">GoodFellas</a></em>, another mafia movie released the same year that quickly captured the same reputation as the first two <em>Godfather</em> films. Within a decade, <em>Part III</em> became a punchline, frequently mocked throughout the '90s as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis">textbook bad sequel</a> or being on the bad end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks">Dueling Works</a>.

<ul><li> During the 1850s, there existed an entire genre of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Tom_literature">"anti-Tom" literature<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (or plantation literature), written mainly by authors from the Southern US <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">in reaction to</a> the anti-slavery work <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>. Such books were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tracts</a> that portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">slavery as a benevolent system that existed for the good of black people</a>, and the arguments against the "peculiar institution" as a sack of lies. Abolitionists were used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">strawmen</a>, presented as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">misguided fools</a> who would often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">"come around"</a> by the end once they saw the "reality" of slavery, or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">mustache-twirling Damn Yankee villains</a> who were out to destroy the Southern way of life, motivated less by compassion for the slaves than by personal gain. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">obvious reasons</a>, this genre died out very quickly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">the Civil War</a>, while <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> has gone on to be regarded as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GreatAmericanNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GreatAmericanNovel">great American novels</a>.
</li><li> The 2000s saw a boom in young adult books about "elite" high school girls following the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>. Books about the lives of rich spoiled teenagers became a big market, with one of the more successful examples, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, being turned into an even more successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">TV series</a> (and to a lesser extent, similar series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheClique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheClique">The Clique</a></em> becoming a <em>very</em> short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>). However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> being so firmly ingrained as a villainous character, as well as youth bullying becoming a hot topic towards the end of the decade, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> turned the main characters of these books from enviable people into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonists</a>. The Great Recession around the same time made the large displays of wealth in the books look tacky and tasteless. Also, many of the series received heavy criticism for depicting their characters (who were almost always minors) in a sexual, sleazy manner. Nowadays, if any of these series are remembered, it's to be made fun of among the people who grew up reading them, or as examples of everything wrong with youth culture in the 2000s.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4wanb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4wanb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4wanb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In hindsight, <em>Mean Girls</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">deconstructed the genre despite being its progenitor</a>, due to its examination of school bullying and showing how being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> wasn't something to be envied; many books that played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> missed the aspect that was being criticized.</span>
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Novels</span>
</p><ul><li> Samuel Richardson's <em>Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded</em> was a best-seller in 1740. Its psychological analysis was revolutionary for its time and remains important. It was a <em>huge</em> cult hit back in its era, to the point it spawned trading cards and many people named their kid after the heroine. But its story... has not aged at all well, to say the least. Many people nowadays take the side of Richardson's rival, Henry Fielding, arguing that its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">morally perfect main lead</a> and tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love Redeems</a> make the novel virtually impossible to connect to. In summary, Pamela Andrews is a 15-year-old maidservant, who repeatedly resists her employer's efforts to seduce or rape her. Said employer repents and eventually marries her, despite their class differences. Pamela then helps reconcile her new husband with his illegitimate daughter from a previous relationship and raises the girl as her own daughter. It is much less popular now than it used to be. Richardson's other main novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Clarissa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Clarissa">Clarissa</a></em>, has fared better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik">The Sheik</a></em> by Edith Maude was a <em>huge</em> best-seller when it was first published in 1919. The novel was adapted into a film in 1921, which was a blockbuster that turned its star Rudolph Valentino into one of the first Hollywood sex symbols. Between its initial release, a resurgence when the film was released and another revival when the star-crossed Valentino died young in 1926, the novel was reported to have sold 1.2 million copies. Although it was well received and popular in the 1920s, <em>The Sheik</em> is now widely despised. Why? Because the entire premise is about an English girl that is abducted by an Arab sheik <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">who repeatedly rapes her until she fell in love with him</a> - and this was seen as romantic. Worse, said rapist is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">revealed out of nowhere at the end</a> to be a child of european immigrants, purely so that the writer wouldn't have an interracial marriage on their hands. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Yeah...</a> Nowadays, it's seen as the pinnacle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> that has gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, and is often compared unfavorably to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">certain other series</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiggleShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiggleShow">Jiggle Show</a>. Starting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, there was a surge in the popularity of shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels">Charlie's Angels</a></em>, and to a lesser extent the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975">Wonder Woman (1975)</a></em> series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>, which were long on beautiful actresses who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing">didn't wear bras</a> but generally seen as a little short on plot. Even at the time, they were seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures">Guilty Pleasures</a>, the joke being that their fanbases were made up mostly of sexually-frustrated men who would be willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">sit through thirty minutes of flimsy dialogue</a> for the chance to see Suzanne Somers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">a bikini</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett">Farrah Fawcett</a> run after a bad guy in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweaterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweaterGirl">tight sweater</a>. A glut of bad shows and a backlash against the decade's overt sexuality in the 80s buried the genre, which then received a second wind in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> and its assorted copycats, while during the 2000s, it was joked that every show on the Fox network that wasn't <em>24</em>, <em>American Idol</em>, a procedural, or an animated sitcom was basically this. However, this second boom coincided with the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">easily accessible pornography on the internet</a> and more liberal views towards sexual matters. As a result, shows that once expected to coast solely on the beauty of their casts increasingly found themselves disappointed, especially as more 'respectable' programs began showing more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">sexually-provocative content</a> up to and including (on the premium cable networks) full-on nudity. This was best demonstrated in 2011, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayboyClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayboyClub">The Playboy Club</a></em> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">revival</a> of <em>Charlie's Angels</em> both got canned after only a few poorly-rated episodes and scathing reviews. Changing views on sexuality and the #MeToo movement during the 2010s would also give the genre a reputation for sexism. Today, the era of "jiggle television" is remembered as fairly quaint and embarrassing, a relic of the days when television had just learned it could start pushing boundaries but not yet really knowing what to do with its newfound freedom.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Series</span>
</p><ul><li> <em>1st and Ten</em> was one of cable television's (in general) first attempts to lure the lucrative sitcom audience away from the "Big Three" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>), by taking advantage of their freedom to include occasional cursing and nudity. It ran for six seasons on HBO for a total of 80 episodes. While the complete series was released on DVD in 2006, the majority of episodes on the "Complete Collection" DVD are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">bowdlerized</a> syndicated versions. To add insult to injury, it's been excluded from the streaming video platform HBO Go (since HBO themselves didn't produce it, the Kushner-Locke Company did). Besides having some dialog and scenes edited for content, syndication versions ran for 22 minutes (as opposed to 30 minutes on HBO), and included a laugh track. While <em>1st and Ten</em> was novel for its time (while language could nonetheless still be considered 'HBO-ish', it wasn't excessively vulgar) when compared to sitcoms on broadcast network television, it seems rather cheesy (with its pretty awful acting, cliched dialogue, continuity catastrophes, editing errors, and an off-and-on laugh track) in a modern context. The participation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OJSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OJSimpson">OJ Simpson</a> most certainly didn't help its long-term legacy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherKnowsBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherKnowsBest">Father Knows Best</a></em> was hugely popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, running for six seasons and reran for years afterwards. However, by the 1960s and 1970s, when the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Women's Liberation movement came to define the American landscape, <em>Father Knows Best</em>, with its idealized middle-class nuclear family, came off as antiquated. Today, it's become infamous due to that, and while other similar shows from the era such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>, <em>The Donna Reed Show</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManyLovesOfDobieGillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManyLovesOfDobieGillis">The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis</a></em> have similar "rose-tinted" reputations, neither attract the same level of disdain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain">Little Britain</a></em> was a hit at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> for its of-the-moment satire of British life, colorful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">catchphrase-driven</a> characters, and lowbrow, shock-driven humor. It was popular enough that a live tour combining reenacted sketches and new pieces was a success as well. However, keeping up its momentum was tough. By Series 3, the established characters and running gags had worn themselves into the ground, the new characters seemed to have no purpose except shock value, and the show and its actors were now so overexposed and overmarketed that audiences were sick of them. Combine that with a critical backlash against the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom">Brit Com</a> format with the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK">The Office (UK)</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais">Ricky Gervais</a>, and its days were numbered. The total flop of the retooled Series 4 (<em>Little Britain USA</em>, co-produced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a>) was the last nail in the coffin. In addition, it didn't age well; its constant pokes at minority groups were controversial enough even at the time, and are now seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">outright cringeworthy</a>. If you ask any teenager who didn't watch it when they were younger, chances are they don't know about it, and if you ask someone who <em>did</em> grow up with it, chances are they regret it. While its leads/creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWalliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWalliams">David Walliams</a> and Matt Lucas have gone on to other successes (the former as both a comic and children's author, the latter as an actor in such shows as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>), <em>Little Britain</em> is just a relic of its time. Lucas eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/matt-lucas-little-britain-big-issue-interview-regrets_uk_59d602dce4b0380b6c9a673b">outright apologised for the content and admitted it was rather insensitive<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, specifically noting that society has "moved on". <em>Walliams And Friend</em>, which came out in 2016, did an unflattering sketch about <em>Little Britain</em> which makes it clear that David Walliams also regards it as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>. In the sketch, Walliams confesses that he made <em>Little Britain</em> by stealing unused <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HarryEnfieldAndChums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HarryEnfieldAndChums">Harry Enfield and Chums</a></em> sketches "from a skip", since he "wasn't even a comedian at the time", while we're shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> <em>Little Britain</em> "clips" which emphasize the show's racism, ableism, and transphobia ("It's alright to make fun of you for being in a wheelchair because you don't really need one!"). All of this culminated in the BBC taking repeats and streaming copies of the show out of circulation in 2020, completing its spectacular fall from grace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown">Murphy Brown</a></em> ran for 10 seasons, garnered critical acclaim, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiceBergen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiceBergen">Candice Bergen</a> won five Emmys for playing the title role during the show's duration. Unfortunately, the show has barely been syndicated, only the first season has been available on DVD, and a revival in the 2018-2019 season was cancelled after 13 episodes. This was largely due to the fact that the show relied on timely issues and then-current events which made the entire show seemed dated. If anything, this show is probably only remembered nowadays for then-Vice President Dan Quayle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">complaining about the title character being a single mother</a>.

It often outdrew <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> in its Sunday night time slot (despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">never being a critical favorite</a> and regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">glurge</a> at its worst), it launched a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> in <em>Promised Land</em> (which lasted three seasons), and reruns of the show were central to the young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ION" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ION">PAX</a> network's lineup. When its time slot was switched to Saturday nights for its final two seasons, ratings plunged, and while it's still in circulation, it's mostly seen as an overly sentimental, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">glurge-friendly</a> joke now — too sugary for non-devout audiences but too liberal for politically hard-right, evangelical Christians who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">plenty of entertainment aimed specifically at them now</a>.

While the episode retained its strong reputation for a while, it ultimately nosedived around the late 1980s as Shatner had gone on to provide far more iconic performances in the <em>TOS</em> films, while the problems with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">White Savior</a> narrative and stereotypical depictions of Native American peoples — all played by actors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brownface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brownface">brownface</a>, no less — became glaringly obvious by the 1990s. What's more, in later years various fanfics and expanded universe novels made far more effective usage of the Preservers than their fleeting mentions in the episode. As a result, the episode is now generally seen as one of the worst not just of the third season, but of <em>TOS</em> in general.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">Sturgeon's Law</a> was in full force, as seen in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/internet/web/geocities-closes-fond-memories-of-free-sites-and-terrible-web-design-644763/2#articleContent">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article: "It didn't take long before this simple change altered the face of the internet. GeoCities gave everyone a place to call home, and then proved that most of us don't really have a lot to say. It didn't take long before GeoCities became home to the bottom of the Internet. Crackpot theories. Inane ramblings. Worm distribution." and "I think that most people set up a GC page as a novelty and then abandoned it leaving a whole lot of cyber-trash behind. That kind of ruined the overall GeoCities vibe; it wasn't long before you had to muck through a few dozen one-offs to find a page that was regularly maintained and had good, interesting content." GeoCities was often seen as a haven of garishly colored pages full of blink tags and animated GIFs. Furthermore, the rise of blogging, as well as social media like Facebook and YouTube, rendered the concept of a free personal homepage obsolete, while those who still wanted to build their own websites moved on to more advanced tools.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternet">Internet</a> portals like Prodigy, CompuServe, iMagination, etc. They were called portals because that's how you usually entered the Internet — they had a lot of links to useful sites, news, and a content listing. When the Internet was fledgling during the '90s, they were extremely popular. However, the more efficient, less resource-intensive, and free World Wide Web put them on a steady decline. Now, they're remembered as a symbol of all that was wrong with the mainstream internet in the '90s, seen as restrictive "walled gardens" that went against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformationWantsToBeFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformationWantsToBeFree">open, freedom-minded ethos</a> of the emerging tech culture. America Online, historically the largest and most successful of these services, is the only one that still remains, and even that's all but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">on its last legs</a>, used <a class="urllink" href="http://time.com/3856066/aol-verizon-deal-dial-up-internet/">primarily<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by older people and those in rural areas that still lack reliable high-speed internet access (the company maintains its dial-up service to this day).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a> was <em>the</em> social media platform in the 2000s, boasting over 60 million users at the height of its popularity and helping to catapult numerous musicians (most notably from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoMusic">emo</a> genre) into the mainstream. However, due to the rise of competing social media sites (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>) that generally had more intuitive format than the rather complex MySpace, around 2008-09 the site began hemorrhaging users as they moved on to other platforms. After founder and unofficial "mascot" Tom Anderson was fired, the site went through a change in management in 2010, attempting to rebrand itself as a "Social Entertainment" site. The site tried repeatedly to reinvent itself and attract back users, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">most of the changes were poorly received</a> by the few users still sticking around (mostly roleplayers, who would end up also leaving MySpace for other blogging platforms like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a>) and often reeked of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">We're Still Relevant, Dammit!</a>-type desperation. After being bought and sold to a revolving door of companies and individuals, the site was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">retooled</a> into a virtual Facebook copy, while also deleting all the existing blogs, comments, and messages (or at least making them inaccessible) without <em>any</em> prior warning whatsoever, which did not amuse the remaining fanbase. <br/><br/>MySpace is still around as a social networking site, albeit now with a heavier emphasis on music and entertainment. However, between the existence of Facebook (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">with Tom himself even stating that he much preferred it</a>) and other competing platforms, MySpace's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">Glory Days</a> are nothing more than a distant memory for many '00s kids, and it soon became considered the Internet equivalent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingTown">Dying Town</a>. Anytime MySpace is ever talked about nowadays, it's often to laugh about how it seemed to be a breeding ground for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Emo Teens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whores</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">pedophiles</a>. The final nail in the coffin occurred when a data purge removed almost everything uploaded between 2005 and 2016, including upwards of 60 million MP3 files. Even if people wanted to check their old MySpace page, they can't now.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ht12');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5ht12" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ht12');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though people can still find old pictures they uploaded on Throwback Thursdays</span>
</li><li> At the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> was the most popular blogging platform, as it was very user-friendly. Its popularity began to wane, however, in the late 2000's, when LJ was sold to an up-and-coming software company known as "Six Apart." Users didn't like how the service (which was originally split into a free "basic" account and a "paid" account that cost roughly $25 a year) now decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and make <em>some</em> of the account features only available to paid accounts free...with the caveat that the blog allowed ads to be placed on it. This was seen as the site "selling out." But the <em>real</em> nail in its coffin came later in 2007, when Six Apart bowed to pressure from a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a> calling itself "Warriors for Innocence," and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">removed adult content</a> (even that which was properly tagged as being 18+), in order to root out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">child porn</a>. The problem with this, however, was that since this job was <em>way</em> too big to accomplish with human eyes, it was done with algorithms. Meaning that <em>other</em> types of content were affected, too: fanfiction communities (especially those with a focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash">Slash</a>), <em>at least</em> one online support group for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, kink and BDSM blogs and communities, online novels, a support group for nursing mothers, and many, many more. There was no warning, and even though many of those blogs and communities were eventually restored, trust had been lost, and the site began hemorrhaging users to other blog sites (many of which used the same open-source code as LJ, meaning they were just as user-friendly.) Users that <em>didn't</em> migrate then migrated after repeated instances of content-purging, and especially after Six Apart went under and sold LJ to a company based in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>. <em>That</em> company then sold LJ to <em>another</em> Russian company, and moved all content to servers based in Russia. Meaning that now the content of blogs was subject to Russian law. To make matters worse, that company updated its terms of service, and <em>allegedly</em> translated them into English (and other languages) for those not familiar with Cyrillic writing, except when those Cyrillically-challenged bloggers clicked "I agree," they were <em>really</em> "agreeing" to the <em>untranslated</em> version, which they may not have <em>actually</em> agreed with had they understood it...and there was question as to <em>exactly</em> how accurate a translation the translated versions actually were. That did not sit well with users outside of Russia, and to this day, <em>very</em> few people from outside that country use the site anymore.

While she attempted to make a comeback on the indies, she eventually got a reputation for no-showing events she was advertised for (it was eight years before she had any match that got anyone's attention and the average wrestling fan can't be expected to stick with anything for more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenYearRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenYearRule">seven</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">While some opinion on her has softened since her untimely passing</a>, she's nonetheless remembered as a representation of everything that was wrong with the Divas division after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> retired.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus">The Nexus</a>. There was a time when the WWE version of NXT was not very well liked, but fans were of the opinion that if The Nexus was the goal all along, then the terrible show was worth it. NXT was a "contest" style show with "rookies" ranging from true rookies to guys with a decent amount of experience to one guy who had been wrestling since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> still existed. Instead of building up to matches between the best guys, like a regular wrestling show, more time was given to obstacle courses, trivia and drinking soda pop. The only wrestler who managed to look halfway decent was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a>, who was actively buried on commentary, given the most losses and then eliminated through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands">New Rules as the Plot Demands</a>. But after winning the contest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett">Wade Barrett</a> unexpectedly turned up on the next WWE show leading all the other "rookies" on a rampage to destroy everything and everyone in their path out of retaliation for being put on through such a terrible experience. It became the most positively received WWE event of the year, up to that point. Daniel Bryan, the most experienced and popular wrestler, being arbitrarily fired did hurt the enthusiasm a little, but he was still wrestling on the independent circuit under his real name of Bryan Danielson and stating he had no ill will over it while the remaining "rookies" continued to destroy everything in their path, convincing fans The Nexus would still go down in history as one of WWE's most iconic stables. Then the inevitable big showdown on pay per view ended with The Nexus suffering a humiliatingly anticlimactic loss. Gone was all the momentum and WWE's attempts to restore The Nexus just reminded people of why they hated the NXT show. Bryan Danielson returned as Daniel Bryan, and still very popular, but that didn't help The Nexus as he was no longer associated with it. Instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> was added to the group to invigorate it, but fans began to ignore the "New Nexus" altogether and focus solely on Punk since he was much more interesting in the ring and on the microphone that the rest put together. Wade Barrett tried to duplicate The Nexus's initial success with "The Corre", and did a pretty good job, much better than "The New Nexus" until, once again, the big fight came on pay per view and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">The Corre were destroyed, losing all momentum in the process.</a> NXT would try to produce another revival of The Nexus with "Genesis" but this attempt didn't even get off to a good start, was the reason for CM Punk's entry as opposed to more focus on "rookies" and again resulted in the firing of the most popular wrestler, with the added scandal of WWE releasing the technically true but disingenuous statement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi">Low Ki</a> asking for his release. NXT would eventually take on a standard wrestling show formula, becoming much more popular in the process, making WWE's first effort that much more hated, and causing fans to proclaim a stable of "rookies" was destined to fail from the beginning, The Nexus mainly being brought up to mock how Danielson was fired, it's three "successors" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">not even getting that much,</a> or to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> is what The Nexus should have been.

Del Rio's booking as a champion would be very weak, losing the title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> in his first defense and winning it right back from him shortly afterwards. After losing the WWE Championship to Punk at <em>Survivor Series</em> to start his legendary 434-day reign, Del Rio quickly faded into the background, taking a few months off to heal before returning to feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> for the World Heavyweight title. The feud, which was quickly decried by fans as boring and seemingly endless, failed to do anything for either man's career. Del Rio turned face not long after his feud was finished and won the WHC from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow">Big Show</a>, but it bombed so badly that he went back to being a heel shortly afterwards. Del Rio would be barely an afterthought for the next year, ultimately being released after getting into a fight with a backstage worker. Del Rio was able to redeem himself the year afterwards thanks to his work in The World Wrestling League, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground">Lucha Underground</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA">AAA</a> as "El Patrón", and eventually returned to WWE in 2015, winning the United States championship from John Cena and getting a massive pop from the crowd. But not even a day after his return, all the work he did to repair his battered image was completely undone, as the fans quickly reverted to showing nothing but apathy towards him. His involvement with the League of Nations only made things worse, but the final straw in his career was his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a>, as the two ultimately started to get continuously into trouble with the WWE Wellness Policy, and less than a year later Del Rio was once again released from his contract. He went over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">Impact Wrestling</a> immediately afterwards, where he was hotshotted to the GFW title, even though people could not care much less about it, and his title reign became yet another symbol of TNA's slow, painful death. <br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin came from the downward spiral his personal life went through, as he became increasingly bitter and resentful towards the way WWE treated him, and his relationship with Paige reached a point where the two ended their engagement amidst allegations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> on Del Rio's part. Today, Alberto Del Rio is seen by fans as an example of an overhyped heel who failed to make any lasting impact, reeked of mediocrity, and at the end of the day proved to be an utterly embarrassing person outside kayfabe, so much so that few people will admit to having <em>ever</em> liked him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJack">New Jack</a>. While wildly popular in the 90s and early 2000s, Jack's bad attitude, reputation for extreme violence in the ring, substance problems and the self-destruction of his body from years of balcony dives have left him largely marginalized in the wrestling industry. Since he's never wrestled for WWE, very few casual wrestling fans have ever heard of New Jack and even many hardcore fans only hear his name crop up nowadays when he has one of his "incidents."

<span class="asscaps"> Styles and Trends</span>
<ul><li> In the 1990s and early 2000s, multiple baseball stars used performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids in order to boost their statistics. For example, Mark McGwire (1998) and later Barry Bonds (2001) broke the season records for most home runs. It was an open secret that at least some of these high-performing athletes were utilizing banned chemical assistance to perform their feats, and while no one was exactly shouting "yay steroids!" in public, the audience' acceptance of their use and cheers of approval for their users amounted to a tacit endorsement. By January 2004, the MLB set rules to suspend players if they tested positive for PEDs. Originally a player would be suspended for up to a whole year after four offenses, but the rule was quickly changed to a lifetime ban after three offenses. In his 2005 autobiography <em>Juiced</em>, former MLB star Jose Canseco admitted to using PEDs and accused several other players of taking drugs. As a result, many of the 90s' top power hitters, and a few pitchers such as Roger Clemens, saw their chances at the Hall of Fame plummet instantly. Most of these players had long since retired, and only a few lasted more than a year on the Hall of Fame ballots. These days, the era of rampant steroid use in baseball is considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> by most players and fans, and few will admit to having been okay with their widespread use in the sport.
</li><li> Back in the 1960s and 1970s, due to rising inflation and construction costs, many US cities that had both major-league baseball and football teams built "multi-purpose" stadiums to accommodate both of them. These massive concrete fortresses—dubbed "cookie-cutter" stadiums for both their circular shape and architectural similarity to each other—tried to please everyone, but the vastly-different dimensions of a baseball field vs. a football gridiron only led to a miserable experience for fans of both sports. Beginning in the mid-1990s, most cities began demolishing their cookie-cutters in favor of purpose-built stadiums for each sport. The last remaining venue to host both an MLB and an NFL team, the infamously-decrepit Oakland Coliseum, will finally become baseball-only again when the Raiders relocate to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> for the 2020 season. To the extent that anyone today is nostalgic for the cookie-cutters, they are only fondly-remembered for being home to the team's best years (e.g. the 70's Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium) and not the venues themselves.

</p><ul><li> Cyclist Lance Armstrong is, perhaps, the biggest and most tragic example of an athlete falling from grace in the 21st century. He was an American sporting hero at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, having not only won seven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a> titles but having done so after beating testicular cancer. He used his profile to establish a highly successful charity dedicated to curing cancer, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, whose Livestrong yellow rubber bracelets became a ubiquitous fashion item mid-decade. However, it had long been rumored that Armstrong's cycling success was a bit less than squeaky-clean and that he had been doping his way to the top. When those rumors were confirmed in 2012, Armstrong was forced to step down from the foundation bearing his name, and the International Cycling Union (the governing body for the sport) stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8m82p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8m82p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8m82p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although it should be noted that none of his vacated titles were awarded to any of his competitors since nearly all of them were <em>also</em> found to be guilty of doping.</span> Now, while he still has his supporters due to his charity work, a lot of people view him as an embarrassment to the sport as well as an utter scumbag, considering he <em>sued</em> people for defamation and <em>won</em> despite their doping claims eventually being revealed as the truth. A common joke was that the Livestrong bracelets should now read "Lie Strong".

<ul><li> For a brief time in the mid-'00s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaneCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaneCook">Dane Cook</a> was one of the most popular stand-up comedians in the US, particularly among high school and college students, serving as one of the first entertainers to use social media (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a> specifically) to build up a huge fanbase. By 2005-06, he had gained over two million MySpace friends, and his CD <em>Retaliation</em> went double-platinum and became the best-selling comedy album in over thirty years. In 2007, he became the second stand-up comedian in history, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewDiceClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewDiceClay">Andrew "Dice" Clay</a>, to sell out Madison Square Garden. Then came the severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> from critics who were not amused by his comedic style (consisting primarily of observational humor and telling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">long-winded anecdotes</a>), as well as hate coming from <em>within</em> the stand-up community, with numerous accusations of plagiarism and joke theft (most notably of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK">Louis C.K.</a>). As Cook's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">fanbase outgrew him</a>, many joined the ranks of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a>, until he was seen as the poster child for dumb college <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fratbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fratbro">fratbro</a> humor aimed at audiences that didn't know any better. Nowadays, few will admit to having been fans of his.
</li><li> Carlos Mencia was a hugely popular comedian in the '00s, selling out massive tours and hosting the successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MindOfMencia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MindOfMencia">Mind of Mencia</a></em>. The entire time, though, he weathered frequent accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Plagiarism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> from all across the comedy world, culminating in an onstage argument with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeRogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeRogan">Joe Rogan</a> in 2007 that was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdugSUFbzws">uploaded to YouTube.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Fans also grew weary of his jokes based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthOfTheBorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthOfTheBorder">Mexican stereotypes</a>, especially given that Mencia was not of Mexican descent, but German-Honduran (his birth name was Ned Holness), while <em>Mind of Mencia</em> came to be seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoorMansSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoorMansSubstitute">poor man's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em>. <em>Mind of Mencia</em> was canceled in 2008, and he hasn't released a new special since 2011.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinstrelShows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinstrelShows">Minstrel Shows</a> were some of the most popular forms of entertainment in the 19th and early 20th centuries, being viewed as good, clean, light comedy. They were also very culturally significant as one of the first uniquely American forms of artistic expression. As times changed, however, the nasty racial undertones that lay at the core of the genre fundamentally discredited it after WWII. The practice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface">blackface</a> — using heavy makeup on a white actor so they can play a caricature of black stereotypes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">or sometimes to sneak an actual black actor on stage, which couldn't be done prior</a>)— is a particular source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.

A notable turning point was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteChristmas">White Christmas</a></em>, the 1954 remake of sorts of 1942's <em>Holiday Inn</em>.

</p><ul><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a> version of Shakespeare's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em> by Nahum Tate. The 1681 rewrite (which Tate boasted "rectifies what was wanting in the Regularity and Probability of the Tale") ends with the good guys surviving, Lear regaining his throne, and Edgar and Cordelia marrying. It proved so popular with Restoration audiences (who <em>hated</em> Shakespeare's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> — purely his own invention and diverging drastically from his source material, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoriaRegumBritanniae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoriaRegumBritanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a></em>, in which the legendary king's story has a cheerful conclusion) that it completely eclipsed Shakespeare's <em>King Lear</em> for the next 150 years, enjoying hundreds of productions, while the original <em>Lear</em> languished in obscurity and went all but unperformed. In the 1830s reverent fans of the Bard began to restore Shakespeare's original ending to performances, and the Tate version gradually fell out of favor, increasingly derided by Victorian critics as sentimental and trite. Since the start of the twentieth century, the Tate play has only been revived a few times, and then only as a quaint historical curiosity.</li></ul></div>

<ul><li> Full motion video games/FMV games. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em> emerged in arcades in the early 1980s, a game with movie-like animation really stood out among the cabinets it competed against. It also helped that the animation was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a>, who had been creating big budget animated movies for years, and the animation of <em>Dragon's Lair</em> was impressive as a result.

After the novelty wore off, gamers quickly caught on that the "gameplay" offered by FMV games was very shallow at best, when the interactivity often a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">quick time events</a>; many FMV games were just clicking through menus to watch different scenes. With the Sega CD and 3DO both ending up as failures in the gaming market, FMV games flopped hard after some initial success, and the genre was dead by the later 1990s. Video game graphics continuing to drastically improve ensured that FMV games wouldn't make a comeback, as their one selling point was their "graphical edge", and that was gone when other games could look on par with them while offering actual gameplay. In the current day, the genre is essentially extinct. While certain FMV games like the above-mentioned <em>Dragon's Lair</em> are still well remembered, most are looked at as a failed experiment with new technology and are often thought of as some of the worst video games ever.

However, Kricfalusi was notoriously egotistical and hard to work with, leading to him getting fired from his own show. Over a decade later, he was given the opportunity to take the reins of the show again with the <em>Adult Party Cartoon</em> series, which was horribly received and led the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrossoutShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrossoutShow">Grossout Show</a> genre that he popularized to gradually fall out of favor with the audience during the second half of the 2000s, and <em>Ren and Stimpy</em> fans began to consider Bob Camp to be the true creator of the show and characters. He lost whatever respect he had left in 2018, when he was revealed to be a sexual predator who had groomed two underaged girls while working on <em>Ren and Stimpy</em> as well as harassing female crewmembers in <em>APC</em>. Things got even worse when he released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CansWithoutLabels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CansWithoutLabels">Cans Without Labels</a></em> in 2019 — it had been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> since 2012, and the outcome was considered not worth the wait.

Not helping was the fact that it continued production well into 2014, mainly because of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content">CanCon policies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> requiring all Canadian television stations to have a certain amount of natively produced content, which allowed the producers to continue the show in spite of its abysmal ratings. The series ended with little fanfare after TV producer David Straiton filed a lawsuit against series creator Scott Fellows (who at that point had zero involvement with the show) for not crediting him as a co-creator for <em>Johnny Test</em>.

<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6424/how-the-chevy-vega-almost-destroyed-gm/">Chevrolet Vega<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was showered with praise by automotive critics when it debuted in 1970, including <em>Motor Trend</em>'s 1971 Car of the Year award and <em>Car and Driver</em>'s Best Economy Sedan for three years running (1971-73). The sleek, comfortable, nimble compact flew off of dealership lots, and it was hailed as proof that General Motors could compete with Volkswagen and Toyota at their own game. However, once those critics and early buyers had their cars for more than a couple of years, they changed their tune <em>fast</em>. The Vega had a multitude of engineering and build quality problems that, before long, made it notorious for rust, breakdowns, excessive oil consumption, and being a death trap in crashes, turning its name into a byword for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a> and a symbol of GM's — and Detroit's — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> in the '70s. By the end of the decade, even many junkyards wouldn't take Vegas, as it was assumed that there were virtually no usable parts that could be stripped off of them before they were simply thrown into the crusher and sold for scrap. Nowadays, Americans remember it as one of the worst cars ever built, a car whose initial praise is now treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> by those magazines.
</li><li> The Hummer. Created in 1992 as a civilian version of the military HMMWV (or "Humvee"), its parent company AM General was purchased by General Motors in 1999, and it soon became one of the most popular SUV brands in the United States, especially after the launch of the smaller, less expensive H2 and H3 models. The original H1 model earned a reputation as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">the ultimate off-road vehicle</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">Rated M for Manly</a> super-truck made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> (who owned several of them and was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/2/20992114/hummer-masculinity-america-humvee-schwarzenegger">instrumental<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in getting it into civilian dealerships), while the H2 and H3 offered the same swagger to people who didn't have six figures to shell out<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9xv3b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9xv3b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9xv3b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">By the time it was discontinued in 2006, the H1 cost up to $150,000 depending on the model</span>. All of them were status symbols, popular for limousine conversions and modifications; custom H2s with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutCar">massive rims and chrome plating</a> were a common sight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRap">Glam Rap</a> videos of the era. <br/><br/>However, sales for the brand started to tumble beginning in 2006 as a result of the oil crisis (even at the height of their popularity, they were notorious for guzzling gas<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10pmgf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10pmgf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10pmgf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even the "compact" H3 model got 14 mpg in city driving and 18 on the highway, while the H2 scored a miserable 10 city / 13 highway</span> and became the butt of jokes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger">oversized SUVs</a>), and hit a nosedive once the financial crisis and subsequent recession hit in 2007-08. Production was halted when GM declared bankruptcy in June of 2009, and after the company emerged from bankruptcy a month later attempts were made to re-brand the Hummer as a more eco-friendly vehicle with a smaller hybrid electric/gas version, which didn't get very far. After GM's attempt to sell the brand to the Sichuan Tengzhong Automobile company in China failed, they completely discontinued the Hummer brand in late 2009, and while GM announced a revival of the Hummer name in 2020, it must be noted that the "New Hummer" will be an electric pick-up in the GMC line rather than a full-fledged brand. Today, the brand is remembered as a poster child for the excesses of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> consumerism, and not many people will admit to having owned one. Only the original H1 model still gets any respect nowadays, and even that comes almost entirely from off-road enthusiasts, while its H2 and H3 siblings are seen as pure style-over-substance road boats that served as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> versions of the H1, cheapening the brand and giving it its current reputation. William Clavey of <em>Jalopnik</em>, looking back on the H2 years later, <a class="urllink" href="http://jalopnik.com/the-hummer-h2-is-a-grand-and-opulent-bad-idea-1796613645">described it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by saying "If theres an automotive equivalent to the phrase 'weve gone too far,' it's the Hummer H2".

</p><ul><li> Zima was a clear alcopop beverage that popped up in the 1990s during the "clear craze" where beverage manufacturers started selling clear drinks (such as Crystal Pepsi and Tab Clear). Zima was marketed heavily by its manufacturer, Coors Brewing Company, as a manly alternative to wine coolers for guys who didn't like beer. For a while, the drink became very popular, but to Coors' horror, most of its drinkers were women in their 20s (the drink was also popular with teenagers due to an urban legend that Zima couldn't be detected on police breathalyzer tests). Coors then attempted to sell Zima to the male demographic by releasing a bourbon-flavored variant but was unsuccessful. After a while, Zima began to gain a reputation as a "girly man" drink and became the butt of jokes by stand-up comedians. The drink's popularity plummeted after its first year, but it managed to linger for another decade before Coors quietly decided to discontinue domestic sales of the drink. These days the only place you can still buy Zima is Japan, although it was briefly brought back for sale in June 2017. To this day some men <em>still</em> make jokes to each other about Zima being a drink for wimps.

Today, they're almost entirely forgotten (there's a reason why "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>" is used on this very wiki as a term for something that modern audiences cannot believe <em>actually</em> existed), except as a reminder of how kitschy people could be during the post-war era.
</li><li> The Hollywood young club scene of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> (an offshoot of the British "rave" scene of the mid-to-late 1990s) disappeared with the advent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>. There was once a time when you couldn't go a week without hearing about the wild partying of young celebrities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, and Nicole Richie. It was all but mandatory to be seen at a club in order to be relevant in the tabloids (as well as in newspapers and magazines and the new crop of websites like TMZ and Perez Hilton), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InDaClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InDaClub">music about the club</a> was a mainstay on the pop charts. Even back then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">the excess of drugs, petty feuds, and partying</a> until sunrise was seen as self-indulgent, but it was accepted as just a part of the celebrity lifestyle. <br/><br/>However, those same excesses became the downfall of club culture by the final years of the decade, which became regarded as ludicrously out-of-touch in an era of economic meltdown, and a new generation of actors, models, and musicians would see the consequences of all that indulgence and stay away. Lohan, whose antics at clubs became legendary, saw her once-promising movie career ruined by her constant partying as it became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">the only thing people knew her for</a>, while Hilton's reputation for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousForBeingFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousForBeingFamous">"famous for doing nothing"</a> and the reveal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">her racist and homophobic views</a> only alienated her to a younger and more progressive generation, with women coming of age now considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">that behaving like a "frat boy" and dressing like a stripper</a> was actually quite sexist and denigrating, apart from the fact it suddenly became a turn-off for many young men. The rise of social media and smartphones also contributed to the scene's fall; not only did it make the cameras inescapable and ensure that indiscretions were impossible to sweep under the rug, but a celebrity no longer have to be seen at a certain location in order to be considered socially active. Nightclubs are still around, but are now seen as unpleasant. They've been mocked for being shallow for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFameNoWealthNoService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFameNoWealthNoService">denying entrance based on appearances</a> (including wearing the "wrong" clothes), and overly long lines that keep people waiting for hours just to go inside. Today's youth see those things as bad service instead of "part of the experience" as previous generations did, leading to a massive closure of nightclubs. These days, few people will admit to becoming so embroiled in the club scene.

However, towards the end of the 19th century, the freaks' previously mysterious anomalies were scientifically explained as genetic mutations or diseases, which gradually led to freaks becoming the objects of sympathy rather than fear or disdain, and laws restricting freak shows were passed. Competition from TV and movies also hurt the freak show — people could just watch TV or go to a theater instead of paying to see freaks. The killing blow was the rise of disability rights causing people to view freak shows as profit-motivated exploitation of the disabled. Today traditional freak shows are extinct, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> ensures that they're not coming back.

In his view, while the place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> is likely assured, beyond them the canon of artists who define rock in a hundred years (like John Philip Sousa for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/March" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/March">marches</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">reggae</a>) may well exclude some legends, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>, that people today are <em>sure</em> will stand the test of time — and may include some second-string bands that are dismissed as fluff today, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a>.

<ul><li> Over the course of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GTARadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GTARadio">Lazlow</a> goes from being one of the hottest DJs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Radio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Radio">radio</a> hosts in America to a washed-up joke who's best known for payola scandals and personal indiscretions, is shilling for the "ZiT!" cellphone app to pay the bills, and gets ridiculed on the street by a passerby. Throughout the series, we get to catch up on him at all the points in his career, from his rise (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCityStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCityStories">VCS</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Vice City</a></em>) to the peak of his popularity (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">GTA III</a></em>) to after his fall (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">GTA IV</a></em>).

</li><li> In <em>Vice City</em>, set in 1986, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand">Love Fist</a> is shown to be one of the biggest bands in the world, with two of their songs playing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GTARadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GTARadio">the rock station</a> and with them going on a world tour that's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">banned in several countries</a>. However, in <em>San Andreas</em>, set six years later, they appear to have been largely forgotten, with the DJ on the classic rock station asking "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneRememberPogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneRememberPogs">whatever happened to Love Fist?</a>" Love Fist was a parody of the stereotypes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRockStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRockStar">the musicians that performed it</a>, so it makes sense that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">by 1992</a>, the band would be washed up like many other hair metal acts were at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">GTA IV</a></em>, set in 2008, the website MyRoomOnline.net is a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Myspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Myspace">Myspace</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">its users</a>, and the culture that surrounded it.

When you first arrive in Hypnospace, it's popular enough to have an entire zone dedicated to it, an active community full of internal disputes on what does or does not count as Coolpunk, and a planned "Coolpunk '99" live music get-together with major corporate sponsors. Then "Coolpunk '99" actually happens, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's a total disaster, complete with a lip-syncing debacle and a helicopter crash that kills a drummer and costs of the headliners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">his leg</a></span>. Shortly thereafter, the community realizes they've been listening to and passionately arguing about a genre focused on sampling soft drink advertisements and Christmas music. And that, aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">weirdly good</a> founding tracks by Fre3zer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">most of it's pretty terrible</a>.

Didi just says that disco is never coming back. The episode was made in 1992 when the anti-disco backlash was still strong. A decade later, both in-universe and in real life, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a>" pilot special would feature precisely Didi and Stu taking part in a disco competition, showing how by that time the genre had become acceptable to like again.
</li><li> This trope is mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> episode "Tattler's Tale" when Lincoln mentions that if his dad found out that he destroyed his disco ball he'd be as dead as disco.

Popeye and Olive win a dance contest at a disco over Bluto (the disco's "star" dancer), only their prize is a year's membership there. They both swear off disco after that.
