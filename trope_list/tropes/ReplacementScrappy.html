</p><p>Sometimes this is understandable: the fans mourn the loss of the old character, whom they have come to know and love, and suddenly they are forced to get to know a new character all over again, and inevitable comparisons will ensue. However, if the new character is poorly written, interacts awkwardly with the old characters, derails the show, or - worst of all - becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>, fans will often go to war over their outrage. Expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">the use of flamethrowers where these characters are discussed</a>, especially if the new character gains a dissenting fandom - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Bases</a> because of these characters are not unknown phenomena. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">Investing in fire-proof armor or a bunker deep underground may help if all-encompassing forum warfare breaks out</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>, but with a main character.

This becomes a lot more likely if the character they initially replaced ever returns. (Most likely because they no longer have the "replacement" stigma hanging over their head, and as such are more likely to be judged on their own merits.)
</p><p>Attempting this in-universe can be risky because it can backfire when the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">actually likes the replacement character</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">ends up becoming a fan favorite</a>.

</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorePopularReplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorePopularReplacement">More Popular Replacement</a>.
</p><p>(Of course, being a Replacement Scrappy does not preclude also being a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a>. It is entirely possible that the audience would have hated the character anyway.)

<ul><li> No one was happy when Free Credit Score hired a new band to replace the old one. <em>No one.</em> Thankfully, the company realized this, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38icBN1f1_g">and judging by this commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it looks like the old band is coming back.
</li><li> Wendy, for whom the Wendy's fast food chain is named, is not nearly the advertiser her father (and the chain's founder) Dave Thomas was. The nameless redhead (who looks like the logo on the sign), who the company brought in to replace Wendy Thomas, isn't much better.

</li><li> The UK's Admiral Insurance has received a lot of criticism for replacing their original mascot the Admiral with a female version. She was intended to be a strong and independent business woman, but ended up coming off as annoyingly obnoxious. Out of all the videos on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel, the ones featuring her tend to get the lowest ratings.
</li><li> UK price comparison site Confused.com's mascot Brian the Robot is considered by many to be a poor, and at worst annoying, replacement for their previous mascot Cara Confused, whose ads included catchy covers of popular songs and some racy humor.
</li><li> In the Sonic commercials, there's two guys who sit in a car and banter back and forth at each other about menu items. Sonic ran commercials without them, and everyone got so mad, they had to bring the two back.
</li><li> In 2014, McDonald's began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedMascot">phasing out</a> their long-time mascot Ronald McDonald for their new one: Happy, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject">living Happy Meal box</a>. While Ronald still exists within the company, in advertising he's been replaced. The new mascot was disliked from the get-go not only for replacing Ronald but because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">creepy looking</a>. Happy is also goofy and nonverbal similar to the <em>Minions</em>, which are controversial in their own right. This has made Happy an unpopular mascot.
<p></p></li><li> Many old school fans of Cinnamon Toast Crunch adored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">cool old guy</a> Chef Wendell so when he got replaced with the Crazy Squares they weren't pleased. Though Chef Wendell was a little loony at times during the 90's as he was written in similar way like other Gerenal Mills mascots at the time (he was more civilized in his earlier appearances) but he was generally entertaining for many and famous for his catch phrase "Can you see the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?" Meanwhile the Crazy Squares are rather infamous for being seen as cannibals since the advertisements often show them eating each other and has turned some old fans away from buying the cereal unless it's one of the rare "old retro covers" that has Chef Wendell on it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewGarfield">Andrew Garfield</a> himself seems to be this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobeyMaguire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobeyMaguire">Tobey Maguire</a>, as many Maguire fans see Maguire as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">preferred Peter</a> and somewhat resent Andrew for not being him. Doubly ironic considering many comic fans have commented on the fact that Garfield's portrayal is much closer to the original Lee-Ditko comics, and was much closer to John Romita Sr. redesign of Peter, which has been his default look for the majority of comics and in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comics, as opposed to Ditko's Spider-Man which is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> of the franchise. Complaints usually involve Andrew's Peter being far less likable than Tobey's, which is mostly because Garfield portrayed the character as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero">Classical Anti-Hero</a> whereas Maguire is portrayed with a more traditional heroic personality. Andrew's emotional range as an actor has also been called into question as being too flat and too wooden throughout the movies (though it must be said that similar complaints have been leveled against Maguire's performance). Other comic book fans, however, welcomed the film and reboot.
</li><li> Richard Parker gets flak from fans for hijacking the plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">the sequel</a> and removing much of Uncle Ben's impact on Peter. A lot of critics have noted that the entire subplot involving him and his operation against Oscorp was actually unnecessary for the story of the sequel and the time spent developing it should have been reserved for other characters.

Sleigh is a New York City detective who is similarly incompetent, but eager-to-please rather than arrogant, and more aware of/confused by the chaos he's involved in than Clouseau ever was. Beyond having a different and ultimately blander character as the focus, the film itself comes off as lazy and cheap compared to its predecessors.

</li><li> Two notable ones from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> mythos.
<ul><li> Much like Richard Parker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderManSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderManSeries">The Amazing Spider-Man Series</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> gets <em>a lot</em> of flak from many Spider-Man fans for effectively removing Ben Parker's influence and impact on this version of Peter.

</li><li> Michelle Jones being set up as Peter Parker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> annoyed fans who were holding out for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a>'s potential appearance in the MCU down the line. The fact that Michelle goes by MJ, which is Mary Jane's nickname, is a subject of contention among fans.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> Movie when Rocky get injured during martial arts practice and has to be replaced by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his generally more annoying younger brother</span>. Behind the scenes this was done to help sell the movie to younger audiences and to fill in the blue ranger role after the actor who portrayed Rocky was hurt in a similar way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>: Count Dooku is a very cool character in his own right, but at the time many fans dismissed him for not being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">Darth Maul</a>. Who was himself very cool, but no Darth Vader.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>: Does this again with Kylo Ren, the successor to Darth Vader.

(Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, he struggles to live up Vader's legacy and reputation)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em> the shiny new starship <em>Excelsior</em> threatens to be the Replacement Scrappy for the <em>Enterprise</em>. This was actually going to happen for real in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a></em>, but a backlash from fans caused the powers that be to rethink that plan. Apparently the backlash was so much that it was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the fourth movie, specifically during shuttle ride through Spacedock, where Sulu claims that he's hoping the former <em>Enterprise</em> crew would received the <em>Excelsior</em>, to which Scotty scoffs at the idea and calls the ship a "bucket of bolts". Then the shuttle turns toward the <em>Excelsior's</em> direction (with the camera following throughout), making it seem like Sulu's wish was going to come true... only for the <em>Enterprise</em>-A to appear behind the <em>Excelsior</em>. You could almost hear the original theater audience's cheers at that point.
</li><li> Between the third and fourth movies, the DC Star Trek comics did in fact have Kirk and Co. on the <em>Excelsior</em>... except for Spock, who was given command of the science vessel Surak. By the time the fourth movie came out, the comics writers had put everything back in place... but this was one reason many fans thought the crew would wind up on Excelsior. Nice fake-out be the moviemakers to make us think (for all of 0.43 seconds) that this was happening.
</li><li> Ironically enough, the <em>Excelsior</em> would become one of the most popular starships in the ST fandom, both due to its unique design (at the time) and for being captained by Sulu (replacing the original captain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Styles</a>) in <em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em>. One supposes this was partly due to <em>not</em> becoming the Replacement Scrappy as everyone feared, instead establishing itself as its own "character" from the <em>Enterprise</em>. Almost burning out her engines to get to <em>Enterprise</em> in time to have her back, in the latter's final mission, against a cutting-edge prototype stealth warship probably didn't hurt either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIII">Superman III</a></em>: While viewers were looking forward to see how Clark's relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> would develop, actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargotKidder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargotKidder">Margot Kidder</a> argued with the producers over the firing of original director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner">Richard Donner</a>.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">some fans wound up prefering Lana to Lois</a>, due Lana being in love with Clark where Lois loved Superman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shemp replacing Curly after Curly suffered a stroke. Opinions on him vary, however, as the reasoning wasn't that he was a bad actor but rather that he was very different from Curly and the show dynamic changed because of it. Ironically, Curly was actually the replacement for Shemp, who was the third stooge during their Vaudeville days, before Curly even began acting. This helped a lot, since his trademark "lovable dope" shtick might not have been the same as Curly's, but Shemp already had built-in comic chemistry with the other two, and was just as game for the physical humor.
</li><li> On the other hand, Joe Besser is universally hated, largely due to Besser's contractual stipulation that Moe couldn't hit him; this was like a kiss of death for any shorts featuring him, since annoyingly clownish characters are tolerable only so long as their annoyance is appropriately punished. Indeed, Joe Besser rather than Shemp personifies this more, as Shemp tends to be more popular than not.
</li><li> Curly Joe De Rita, for the most part, avoided this trope. He was brought in to play the third stooge during their comeback, and managed to be an effective stooge in his own right (and despite the name, he didn't act like Curly). It also helped that the guy he was replacing was the aforementioned (and widely hated) Besser, and by this stage in their career the Stooges had already toned down the slapstick violence anyway, as the guys were getting too old to convincingly smack each other around by the 1960's, and were also aiming to be more kid-friendly with their comedy.

Ten books later in <em>The Sight</em>, Graystripe, who was captured by humans in <em>Dawn</em>, returns to the Clans with a new mate called Millie. Millie has received a ton of hate, and most of it is for either not being Silverstream, or (among fans who completely ignore the aesop about racism) for being a former kittypet.
</li><li> Cinderheart, the reincarnation of the snarky medicine cat Cinderpelt, is hated for being more optimistic and playful than her jaded previous incarnation.

Unfortunately, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moiraine</span> was likeable and seemed to genuinely care about people, Cadsuane was a bossy, knowitall Mary Sue.
<ul><li> In fairness, this was likely mostly intentional, as the original was putting the Aes Sedai and co in danger of being sympathetic and the author needed to keep them firmly in antagonist territory for later plot development to work. If Rand thought they were probably inclined to be reasonable and negotiated the series probably would have come in at its original intended length instead of seven or eight times longer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears">The Wicked Years</a></em> fans haven't taken much of an interest in Liir, who replaced Elphaba after she died.

<ul><li> Kenny Jones, successor to drummer Keith Moon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>, is this to many people - to the point where singer Roger Daltrey refused to do reunion tours with the group unless Jones was dismissed. Perhaps due to the passage of time, Jones' replacement Zak "Son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo</a>" Starkey and the late John Entwistle's substitute bassist Pino Palladino have fared better.
<ul><li> In a late-90's interview, Daltrey described Jones as "a great drummer and a good friend, but he wasn't the right guy". If you listen, Jones' playing was very sedate compared to the manic style of Moon.
</li></ul></li><li> In music there's the fans reactions to the many incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge">Queens of the Stone Age</a> - "What happened to Nick Oliveri?", "Dave Grohl was a way better drummer than this guy", "Mark Lanegan should be the singer", "Josh should just reform Kyuss..."
</li><li> Before the worldwide phenomenon that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatlemania</a>, a fair number of their O.G. British fans resented the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> replaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">Pete Best</a> on drums. The exact reason for Best being fired varies depending on where you hear it from, being either because he didn't fit in with John, George, and Paul, he was too moody, or Brian Epstein not thinking he was a good enough drummer. At the time, Pete was the most popular member of the group in their home of Liverpool, and fans would carry signs saying, "Ringo Never, Pete Forever" at their concerts.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> fans (including the other band members themselves) are guilty of heaping unnecessary scorn on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonNewsted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonNewsted">Jason Newsted</a> because he had the misfortune of replacing the late, lamented Cliff Burton on bass. Metallica themselves shared the sentiment, constantly treating Newsted like "the newbie" and burying his bass work in the mixes. Newsted eventually left the band over his poor treatment, and while his replacement, Robert Trujillo, gets some redirected scorn from fans, the band themselves absolutely love him, openly calling him "the man who saved Metallica."
</li><li> Sammy Hagar. There's a reason people refuse to call the Hagar-era band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>...
<ul><li> There's a fair bit of denial that Van Halen did a record with Gary Cherone.
</li><li> Eddie's son Wolfgang, who replaced Michael Anthony on bass, gets unfairly treated this way at times. At least a large amount of this by fans who want Anthony to return, and/or who object to Anthony being replaced unceremoniously by Wolfgang prior to the release of <em>A Different Kind Of Truth</em>. Eddie, in the meantime, is open to a reunion, but credits his inspiration for the new album to jamming with Alex and Wolfgang in Eddie's studio.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadCompany">Paul Rodgers</a>; it isn't that he's a bad singer, it's just that Freddie is one <em>hell</em> of a tough act to follow. Even the band themselves insist on being known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">"Queen + Paul Rodgers"</a>.
<ul><li> Even more so with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert">Adam Lambert</a> now on lead vocals.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/INXS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/INXS">INXS</a> with J.D. Fortune isn't INXS.
</li><li> The Finnish monster rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi">Lordi</a> has had this problem. To date, they've replaced the bassist three times (Magnum with G-Stealer, G-Stealer with Kalma, and Kalma with OX) and the pianist once (Enary with Awa.) While very few fans can deny that the quality of the music has never diminished after a switch, and has often improved, the new band member's costume can cause fits in the fandom (for example, Enary, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">busty blonde valkyrie</a>, being replaced with Awa, the grey corpse-like ghost/witch.)
</li><li> William DuVall in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a>. He's not Layne Staley and most fans just can't accept that.
<ul><li> Funny enough, before the band landed on who would be the new singer, fans were worried that they would choose one of Layne's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">many imitators</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Godsmack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Godsmack">Sully Erna</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Chester Bennington</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Staind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Staind">Aaron Lewis</a>. When they chose someone who sounds decidedly different, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">many of the same fans were complaining about how the band chose someone who ''didn't'' sound like Staley</a>.
<ul><li> DuVall was probably the safest choice (short of not reuniting at all, naturally); he had been singing Layne's parts with Jerry Cantrell's solo band for some time and fans seemed to think he did a respectable job. It seemed like the issue was not DuVall as a vocalist, but as a replacement for Layne regardless of who.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Ever since Scott Weiland was fired from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a>, fans and radio DJ's will still often refer to them as "Stone Temple Pilots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Chester Bennington</a>".
<ul><li> Chester's brief time in the band has been somewhat vindicated by history after his tragic passing in 2017. His replacement, Jeff Gutt, has much bigger shoes to fill.
</li></ul></li><li> This is very common in female-fronted metal:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a>: after Tarja Turunen was replaced with Anette Olzon, the latter was quickly disliked for not having the strong vocal range of her predecessor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAgonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAgonist">The Agonist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> have a similar one. In The Agonist, Alissa White-Gluz was the first vocalist (and one of the founding members) but she was kicked out of the band for joining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> when long-term vocalist Angela Gossow decided to call it quits. Vicky Psarakis (The Agonist) is massively hated for "not being Alissa" and Alissa has the same problem in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> for not being Angela, while Arch Enemy backing Alissa just isn't the same as The Agonist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tristania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tristania">Tristania</a> is often considered to not be the same after Vibeke Stene left and the Italian Mary Demurtas took over.
</li><li> The same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheatreOfTragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheatreOfTragedy">Theatre of Tragedy</a> following the departure of Liv Kristine.
</li><li> A tragic example occurs with the band <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elis_%28band%29">Elis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from Liechtenstein, whose first singer unexpectedly succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage in 2006. Given the circumstances, the fans contained themselves, but the two following singers never managed to step out of the shadow of Sabine Dünser.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, Tim 'Ripper' Owens was hated by many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> and Iced Earth fans for not being Rob Halford or Matt Barlow, even though he's a very talented vocalist in his own right.
<ul><li> However, being fired right around Christmas just to bring back Matt Barlow lead to a thankfully death-free version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorScrappy">Alas, Poor Scrappy</a>. Which was kind of sad because many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth">Iced Earth</a> fans had <em>just</em> started to accept Ripper.
<ul><li> On the other hand, there have been relatively few complaints about Stu Block, who came in after Barlow left again, largely thanks to his ability to sound like a dead ringer for either Barlow or Ripper when he so chooses without compromising his own unique sound.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Blaze Bayley is not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Accept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Accept">Accept</a> lost a considerable amount of fans after replacing vocalist Udo Dirkschneider with David Reece and drastically changed their sound on their <em>Eat The Heat</em> album, after which they wisely took back Udo.
</li><li> Also likewise, Mike DiMeo is hated by Masterplan fans for not being the almost identically styled Jorn Lande.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrowningPool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrowningPool">Drowning Pool</a> vocalist Dave Williams' sudden death, a lot of fans found it difficult to accept his replacement vocalist Jason Jones (which likely contributed to his departure from the band), and after Jones quit, his replacement vocalist, <em>Soil</em> singer Ryan McCombs was slightly more accepted, though still considered inferior to Williams. Jasen Moreno, meanwhile was widely considered a step down from McCombs.
</li><li> Even though it's been almost fifteen years, many fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Helloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Helloween">Helloween</a> <em>still</em> do not accept their current vocalist Andi Deris. Deris has been with the band longer than both Michael Kiske and Kai Hansen <em>combined</em>! It doesn't help that Kiske was the vocalist for Helloween's most successful albums, <em>Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 &amp; Pt. 2</em>.
</li><li> An odd example happened early on with the new drummer brought in to back up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a> on "John Henry". What was so odd? He replaced a drum machine. Some fans protested the move, although everyone has since gotten over it.
</li><li> When Vince Neil left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> in the early '90s, they decided to replace him with John Corabi for their ironically self-titled album in 1994. They would retroactively blame its poor sales on "the new ingredient", as stated in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheMusic">Behind The Music</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kamelot">Kamelot</a> has a rare inversion. Original vocalist Mark Vanderbilt is now disliked by most of the fandom, however, considering his mediocre to awful singing style, and replacement by the classically trained opera styled Roy Khan previously of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal">Progressive Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Conception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Conception">Conception</a>, you can't blame them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a>: Johnson's replacement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Axl Rose</a> divided many fans alike.
</li><li> Various people dislike Michael Tait taking over as lead singer for the Newsboys despite him being a decent singer, simply because he doesn't sound like previous lead Peter Furler.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a>: Collins' replacement Ray Wilson, whose sole album as Genesis frontman, <em>Calling All Stations</em> was not well received by fans and critics due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> sound and it's no wonder that no songs were performed when the band reunited with Collins for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">2006-07 reunion tour</a>.
</li><li> Country music band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a> was heavily criticized during the period in which Cody Collins (who previously fronted another short-lived country band called McAlyster) replaced longtime lead singer Richie McDonald from 2007 to 2011. Although McDonald was already derided for delving into oversung <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narm</a>, whatever fans the band had left felt that Collins was too bland and that the band just didn't sound the same. McDonald ultimately rejoined in 2011.
</li><li> There still are Angra fans embittered that Edu Falaschi replaced Andre Matos as lead singer (despite Matos' leaving being of his own will, and being from a more complicated matter than musical differences). One of their main complaints about Falaschi is that he couldn't even sing the band's signature song, "Carry On", without slipping out of tune.
</li><li> This happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sepultura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sepultura">Sepultura</a> when Derrick Green replaced Max Cavalera. Curiously, Jean Dolabella didn't receive as much flak when he substituted Igor Cavalera on drums, both because the two albums he recorded (<em>A-Lex</em> and <em>Kairos</em>) were well received and because everyone (even in the band) was waiting for Igor to follow his bro, and Eloy Casagrande was given an even warmer reception after <em>he</em> replaced Dolabella.
</li><li> Many fans of Exodus hate their latest vocalist Rob Dukes, partially because of his drastically different style of singing than Paul Baloff and Steve 'Zetro' Souza, their previous two singers, though they also have their own reasons. The fact that the band chose to re-record their landmark debut album with him didn't help <em>at all</em>. However, the band has only released 3 original albums with Dukes, so they still have time to warm up to him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a> both inverted and played this one straight. Inverted in that their singer on the first two albums, Chuck Mosely, was unceremoniously fired from the band and replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton">Mike Patton</a>, and you can count the number of people who thought this was a bad thing on the fingers of one hand. However, since Jim Martin departed in 1993 following the release of <em>Angel Dust</em>, a series of guitarists appeared and each one was given grief simply for not being Jim. Even when they reformed in 2009 with the same lineup they had since 1996, some people were upset because Jim wasn't involved.
</li><li> Quite possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> second drummer, Matt Sorum. Axl Rose described other former members of the band as 'former members', but described Sorum as a 'former employee'. It probably didn't help that the guy he replaced, Steven Adler (whose heroin addiction was so bad he could barely stay awake during recording sessions) happens to be a childhood friend of Slash.
<ul><li> Nowadays, it's everyone in the band (not counting Axl himself and longtime keyboardist Dizzy Reed, the only members appearing on any albums before <em>Chinese Democracy</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Jake E. Lee, who played guitar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> after the tragic death of Randy Rhoads. Fans would hold up pictures of Rhoads during concerts and flip Jake middle fingers during his solos. Jake was ultimately fired by Sharon Osbourne after the 1987 release of the <em>Randy Rhoads Tribute</em> live album. His replacement, Zakk Wylde, fared much better, though Lee ultimately became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> as a very creative, unique, and interesting guitarist who did his own thing instead of blindly copying Rhoads and ultimately became a subversion.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> have never been able to really recover after the bands reunion without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Jello Biafra</a>.
</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> vocalist not named Jon Anderson, and to a lesser extent any keyboardist other than Rick Wakeman and any guitarist other than Steve Howe are generally regarded as replacement scrappies by at least some large part of Yes' infamously fragmented fanbase.
<ul><li> The band's stint with Trevor Rabin replacing Howe on guitar in the 1980's is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> among fans. Some say he saved the band from extinction and updated their sound, others say he ruined them by turning them into a pop band.
</li></ul></li><li> A very vocal portion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> Army consider Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer Replacement Scrappies, despite having been in the band longer than the original members they replaced.
</li><li> Ask an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Obituary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Obituary">Obituary</a> fan about their opinion on Ralph Santolla's run with the band. If they don't refer to him as "that drunken retard who had to play some ridiculously overblown guitar solo every thirty seconds", then you have made a very, very, <em>very</em> rare find. While somewhat divisive with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deicide">Deicide</a> fans, most of them enjoyed <em>The Stench of Redemption</em> and didn't place all of the blame on him for the lackluster quality of the other two Santolla-era Deicide albums. Obituary fans, on the other hand, <em>despise</em> him, wish that they had never hired him to replace Allen West, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">like to pretend that the two albums that he was on never existed</a>.
</li><li> For many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a>'s longtime, die-hard fans, any guitarist whose name isn't Terry Kath.
</li><li> When brothers Ricky Lee and Doug Phelps left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKentuckyHeadhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKentuckyHeadhunters">The Kentucky Headhunters</a> in 1992 to form Brother Phelps, their respective roles as lead singer and bassist were taken over by Mark S. Orr and Anthony Kenney. (Kenney had previously played in an earlier incarnation of the band in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>.) Orr was hated by fans, critics, and even rhythm guitarist Richard Young for having a more scratchy delivery better suited for blues or R&amp;B than for twangy Southern rock. After doing only two albums (one a collaboration with blues pianist Johnnie Johnson) and a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" for a tribute album, Orr quit in 1995 over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>. This was averted when Doug returned to the band and took over on lead vocals, as his style is very similar to that of his brother's.
</li><li> Joe Lynn Turner is a successful and prolific hard rock singer, mostly remembered for being in Ritchie Blackmore's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a> in the eighties until Blackmore disbanded Rainbow to rejoin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a>. When enmity between Blackmore and Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan led to the latter being fired, Blackmore eventually recruited Turner to replace him. The fans did not like this change at all, and faced with the rest of the band (and the record company) demanding Gillan's return, Blackmore agreed to drop Turner. Adding insult to injury, all the material Turner had written for the next album was handed over to Gillan to rework as his own.
<ul><li> This is adding insult to injury, because Joe Lynn Turner was already a Replacement Scrappy in Rainbow - he replaced legend in his own right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio">Ronnie James Dio</a>, and his time with Rainbow is considered the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. (Even Dio dissed the new incarnation of Rainbow, referring to them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss">"Foreigner Junior"</a>)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDaysGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDaysGrace">Three Days Grace</a> fans have had a hard time accepting Matt Walst, Adam Gontier's replacement. For most, it was a letdown that Gontier left in the first place - his timing couldn't have been worse, and his immediate excuse was seen as flimsy as well - and Walst was just salt in the wound. That being said, casual fans still liked them, and their songs still soared to the top of the rock charts. Gontier's follow-up band Saint Asonia, while only achieving modest radio success, has largely avoided this, and most die-hard 3DG fans prefer Saint Asonia to Walst's band.
</li><li> When Paul Bostaph replaced Dave Lombardo in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Slayer</a> he was almost immediately hated by fans for being an inferior replacement. He is a very good drummer himself, but he just happened to replace the most acclaimed drummer in all thrash metal. The fact that his joining coincided with Slayer entering the 90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> didn't help.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation">Suffocation</a> fans didn't <em>dislike</em> Ricky Myers at all (indeed, the consensus was that he did a very solid job as their touring vocalist), they made it very clear that they would have much rather had Frank Mullen up onstage than Myers. This has surprisingly been subverted with Kevin Muller; while they still miss Frank, Kevin's energy and surprising vocal similarity to a young Frank has managed to win over most of the fanbase.

<ul><li> Mitsuo Momota, son of the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikidozan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikidozan">Rikidozan</a>, was a textbook example in the transition between JWA to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a>. Poor Momota's "legendary" for being inferior in every conceivable way.
</li><li> One of the most famous examples is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger">Lex Luger</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> run in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a>, where he was essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s Replacement Scrappy. Despite (or perhaps because of) him playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">All-American Face</a> to an even greater hilt than Hogan himself, the fans still saw him as a cheap imitation and hated him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">But they kept trying, and trying, and trying to get him over</a> It didn't help that Luger's "Narcissist" gimmick was rather well-liked and was getting pretty over when it was just inexplicably dumped for the "Made in the USA" gimmick.
</li><li> When Crush (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianAdams">Brian Adams</a>) joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Demolition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Demolition">Demolition</a> in the WWF and eventually replaced Ax altogether. Similarly, Dino Bravo replacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake">Brutus Beefcake</a> in the Dream Team.
</li><li> Another great example was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">fake Diesel</a> and fake Razor Ramon (Rick "Big Titan" Bogner, best known for his work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW">FMW</a>), three months after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> left for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>. These two were a <em>deliberate</em> invocation of the Replacement Scrappy trope, as they were introduced by a freshly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face Heel Turned</a> Jim Ross specifically to embarrass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a>. There were legal issues involved as well. WWF was suing WCW at the time over Hall and Nash's appearance, claiming they were passing them off as Ramon and Diesel (the two were unnamed "invaders" at the time, and weren't named until their first PPV match, at <em>WCW Bash at the Beach 96,</em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> turned heel to launch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">nWo</a>). New characters with the same names (intentional Replacement Scrappy or not) was a clear sign that WWF intended to use and enforce the trademarked names.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWECommentators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWECommentators">Jonathan Coachman</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JoeyStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JoeyStyles">Joey Styles</a> got this when they replaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> as the play-by-play announcer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">Raw</a></em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Michael Cole</a> seems to have somewhat avoided this when Ross was moved to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SmackDown">Smack Down</a></em> rather than simply taken off TV. Mostly because he was already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> to begin with.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeAdamle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeAdamle">Mike Adamle</a> got this for replacing Styles (who retired from play-by-play announcing out of the blue) on ECW. When he became Raw's General Manager (ironically, the previous GM <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WilliamRegal">William Regal</a> returned from suspension on the same day), <em>his</em> replacement of Todd Grisham is probably seen as an improvement.
</li><li> Joey Styles only got the job for two reasons: 1. WWE failed to snag <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship">UFC</a> commentator Mike Goldberg, and 2. the general consensus was that Joey was the only possible choice that would not be seen as a Replacement Scrappy by the fanbase. And, while he still did get a bit of heat over it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> being what it is), most of the criticism of Joey actually came from the upper management, who hated his style from the very start and constantly exhorted him to call the matches more like Jim Ross used to (i.e. with less emphasis on play-by-play and more emphasis on "telling the story" of the match). It seems WWE will never be satisfied with any replacement until they can find somebody exactly like Jim Ross, but younger, less Southern, and more telegenic (in other words: Crockett Promotions-era Jim Ross), while the fans will not be satisfied until they can find somebody exactly like Jim Ross, but better able to call the moves. Either way, it shows why Jim Ross is generally thought to be irreplaceable.
<ul><li> On the plus side, Matt Striker has taken his place on <em>SmackDown!</em>, but his ECW replacement (Byron Saxton) isn't exactly a perfect substitute, though popular enough.
</li><li> The hatred (and the 'Cole Miners' fanbase) for Michael Cole in 2010-2012 (largely due to his ridiculous fanboying of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>) until the writers gave him legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and became a damn near evil heel and gave him a real feud (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 27</em> match) against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a>. That being said, the angle was pretty bad and got dragged out a lot longer than it needed to be. Also the <em>SmackDown</em> table was joined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>. He got turned face again, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">saved</a>, possibly for life, after the Lawler heart attack.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While Perro Aguayo Jr. became very popular after only a sort time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA">AAA</a>, he was met with vitriol by fans attending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a> shows, who found his father far more entertaining. However, Aguayo's persistence, some clever booking and the Perros Del Mal stable headed alongside Hector Garza lead to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">becoming one of the CMLL's biggest stars</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> left the WWF in 2001, his replacement, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a>, got all kinds of crazed hatred from a fanbase demanding that Jerry be brought back. Heyman actually did a phenomenal job as commentator...which became all the more apparent when Jerry came back and proceeded to completely mail in his performance for the next decade. Heyman started gaining his fair share of fans over his months as an announcer, so when he was booted for the returning Lawler, Lawler got his share of this as well.
</li><li> This concept might go a long way in explaining <em>why</em> Xavier is the least celebrated of the men to have held the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> Championship belt. The first champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi">Low Ki</a> was naturally a contender for the most popular man in the promotion but his title reign was over almost as soon as it got started, in favor of a man with a superficially similar wrestling style but lacking Low Ki's distinctive look, aggression, intensity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssBaritone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssBaritone">Bad Ass Baritone</a> on top of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor">Spirited Competitor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker">Challenge Seeker</a>.

</li><li> In their unexplained release of Daniel Puder, a proven, respected participant of the popular combat sport called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a>, WWE doomed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>, the runner up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough">WWE Tough Enough</a> contest that Puder won by fan vote, to this status. It didn't help that Miz talked about having to overcome the stigma of not coming from something like MMA during his early years in the wrestling industry, which only drew more minds to Puder and the program with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> that WWE thoughtlessly threw away.

IV was well received but his existence made CMLL change Black Tiger III to El Bronco, who wasn't. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">Black Tiger III became a replacement scrappy to himself!</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas">La Sombra</a> and Volador junior were among CMLL's most loved and hated luchadors in 2013 but their mask vs mask match at the 80th anniversary show of the promotion was not well received by the fans, as to take place it had to deny them of a mask vs mask match between Último Guerrero and the legendary Atlantis, which they had been waiting decades to see.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> has somehow managed to become this for <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a></strong></em>, of all people. What it comes down to is the "Superman" character they're both playing, and the fact that whoever is playing that character gets to be THE top guy, which is strange. The character is hated by everybody who isn't under the age of ten or a woman. That's why Cena was such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base Breaker</a>. That being said, for how much fans hated Cena over it, he at least made it <em>bearable</em>. Reigns' run with the character has gotten so bad that even the smarks miss Cena, and many are starting to speculate (half-jokingly, half-not) that this is all some grand master plan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/PoisonOakEpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/PoisonOakEpilepticTrees">to get Cena universally over with the IWC</a>.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> got put on the shelf for nine months, Jordan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> allowed Jordan to replace Ambrose as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>' tag team partner, allowing them to win the RAW Tag Team Titles. Jordan subsequently tried to take Ambrose's place in the Shield. That's where the invoked part comes into play — not only did the fans hate Jordan for trying, but so did the Shield themselves. Rollins can barely tolerate Jordan (with it becoming increasingly obvious how much he wants Ambrose in Jordan's place), only does so for the titles, and finds his patience increasingly worn out by Jordan landing them in unnecessary fights. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> can't even bother with that much, having taken Ambrose's injury really badly and blatantly hating Jordan as a result.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan">Terry Wogan</a> made a truly heroic effort to prevent this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ChrisEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ChrisEvans">Chris Evans</a> took over his morning slot on BBC Radio 2, aided and abetted by the fact that at least nobody was foolish enough to try to find a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> for Wogan. Audience reactions were mixed, to say the least, and generally varied, according to whether you could stand the drivetime show Evans had been hosting previously, and how much you missed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/SarahKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/SarahKennedy">Sarah Kennedy</a>, whose immediately preceding show was shortened and sidelined to give Evans more airtime. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nu13');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1nu13" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nu13');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kennedy left the BBC for reasons which are still shrouded in mystery.

Fans of Sarah Kennedy tend to consider Vanessa is pretty much a Replacement Scrappy.
<ul><li> Now Chris Evans has announced he is to leave the morning show (in September 2018), one thing which is absolutely certain is that his fan-base will regard the eventual sucessor as a Replacement Scrappy and they're going to have a tough time. she turned out in the event to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZoeBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZoeBall">Zoe Ball</a>. Who got some flak, but notas much as was anticipated.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown">American Country Countdown</a></em> fired longtime host Bob Kingsley in 2005 and replaced him with Kix Brooks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>. Many longtime fans of the show dislike Kix Brooks for his high, whiny voice and "chummy" attitude towards artists, as well as the corporate decision to cut the show from 40 to 30 because program directors were "uncomfortable" with the newness of the 31-40 songs (the show later reverted to 40). He was also derided for modernizing the show too much — while the songs that Bob played between countdown slots could often be up to 20 years old, Kix quickly refused to play anything more than a year or two old. Kix also seems to lack Bob's interest in showing historical behind-the-scenes info on songs, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">he constantly gets chart information and even artists' names wrong</a>. Meanwhile, many professional deejays hate Kix for quickly rising in the ranks of professional radio hosts despite a lack of experience. But fans of Kingsley have had little to worry about, as he promptly moved over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/BobKingsleysCountryTop40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/BobKingsleysCountryTop40">Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40</a></em>, which is nearly identical to the format that <em>ACC</em> used when he was still the host.
</li><li> The show that <em>ACC</em> spun off from, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanTop40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanTop40">American Top 40</a></em>, went through something similar when co-creator and longtime host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaseyKasem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaseyKasem">Casey Kasem</a> left the show over a contract dispute in 1988, and was replaced by Shadoe Stevens, a move that for many fans signaled the beginning of the end for the show. Stevens himself was disliked simply because he didn't have the style, charm, or personality of Kasem (similarly to Bob Kingsley above, many previously-loyal listeners ended up jumping ship to Kasem's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> program, <em>Casey's Top 40</em>, which began the year after Kasem left <em>AT40</em>), but his years on the program were also marred with attempts at appealing to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a> audience. As a result, the show was removed from American airwaves in 1994 and cancelled altogether in 1995.
<ul><li> Nine years later, in 2004, Kasem took his second (and final) bow from the program (which had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> in 1998), to be replaced by the current host, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>'s Ryan Seacrest. While there was a lot less said about the changeover this time around, many longtime fans still don't hold Seacrest (or the current iteration of the show, for that matter) in nearly as high a regard.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to a syndicate merger, two rival shows focusing on classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> were subject to this. <em>Country Gold</em> replaced longtime host Rowdy Yates with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama">Alabama</a> lead singer Randy Owen in mid-2012, while <em>Rick Jackson's Country Hall of Fame</em> was ended entirely due to the syndicate not wanting two similar shows. Under Owen's watch, <em>Country Gold</em> was cut from 5 hours to 4, and listener requests were voicemailed instead of taken live. Randy was criticized both for his sleepy delivery (a far cry from Rowdy's more boisterous tones) and for focusing the show more on ass-kissing stories about fellow artists instead of the historical tidbits that Rowdy offered. Once rights issues were settled, both Rowdy and Rick started new shows, <em>The Original Country Gold</em> and <em>Rick Jackson's Country Classics</em> respectively, both of which were identical to their predecessors. As a result, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.insideradio.com/Article.asp?id=2638560&amp;spid=32061#.UxKlvV7eqvk">many affiliates<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who had been stuck with Randy Owen switched back to Rowdy and/or Rick once their new shows got off the ground. Randy's show struggled to find affiliates, to the point that many doubted that it was even airing anywhere, until a March 2016 announcement that Canadian country singer Terri Clark would take his place and the show would begin focusing more on 90's material.

Unfortunately the resulting character of Trigger acted like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to his fellow cast members, which came as a unexpected shock to players who were familiar with the friendly Zenna, and unlike the more interesting and complex Dust, Trigger's motivations were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">far less complex and interesting</a>, making him seem shallow in comparison; as a result, he became a Replacement Scrappy on <em>two</em> fronts. Reception <em>started</em> to warm up with a series of flashbacks detailing his rivalry with Amanda (and in the process introduced his partner Montoya, who was ironically had a significantly warmer reception) until he went and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">deserted the team</a>, which again took chilled his reception. Eventually, the whole deal got so out of hand that Atton Rand eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed him off</span> and humiliated him further with a humorous <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">afterlife</span> scene that also poked fun at an earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>... and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">that</a></em> was not as well-received as he'd hoped.

<ul><li> Whenever a prominent/legendary athlete retires or leaves his longtime team via a trade or free agency, his replacement at that position is almost certain to become this. We say "almost", because the replacement could become legendary in his own right (see Steve Young replacing Joe Montana, Aaron Rodgers replacing Brett Favre, Cory Schneider replacing Martin Brodeur, Didi Gregorius replacing Derek Jeter, or Andrew Luck replacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a>, for instance).

</li><li> Jason Giambi had to deal with this TWICE, being Mark McGwire's replacement in Oakland and then replacing fan favorite Tino Martinez (who had been a mainstay for four World Series championship teams) with the Yankees. Martinez could likely sympathize, as he had replaced Don Mattingly in New York and went from there to St. Louis to replace McGwire.
</li><li> After the Boston Red Sox suffered a major collapse in September 2011 that cost them a trip to the World Series, manager Terry Francona, who had led the Sox to <em>two</em> World Series wins, was fired, and replaced by Bobby Valentine, who has repeatedly come off as a disrespectful jerk, and has actually sent the Sox close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">last place in the MLB</a>.
</li><li> With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal</a> having been living legends in the sport of tennis for so long, it's safe to say that <em>anyone</em> who replaced them as the World No. 1 would be doomed from the very start to be unable to live up to his universally beloved predecessors in many tennis fans' eyes. Add to that how Novak Djokovic tends to be somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> in contrast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Federer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">Nadal</a> and how his ascension to the No. 1 spot in 2011 included inflicting a series of painful losses on both of them, and you have the sports equivalent of this trope. Djokovic's gained his own large fanbase since then, but there are still some fans who will never forgive him for not being Federer or Nadal.

On the other hand, the Fitzroy loyalists who follow the <strong>Victorian</strong> team are still going strong and don't give two hoots about the Brisbane club so this trope still applies in good doses. It's especially painful when the AFL introduced clubs in areas of the country that are nowhere near as hardcore about the sport just to attract new markets.

The mild-to-moderate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a> nature of the classes in question didn't help.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Theme Parks </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In general, whenever a theme park closes a ride for a new one, many fans of the old ride won't be too thrilled with the new ride.
</li><li> The above especially applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a>. Usually examples are mixed with a nice helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> for attractions that get revamps.
<ul><li> Disneyland's most well-known example is Light Magic, a rather underwhelming replacement for the world famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a> Main Street Electrical Parade. Being stripped of the Electrical Parade has haunted Disneyland fans for years.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21ql0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21ql0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21ql0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is a very good example of why sometimes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> folks are actually right. The differences can partially be summarized by saying that MSEP was a parade (so all viewers got approximately the same show), while LM was essentially a mobile theatrical performance (so viewers where the floats stopped got the actual show, and viewers in between stops got to watch the floats roll past).</span>
</li><li> Actually, this is true whenever a new Disneyland parade or show replaces an old one. See Parade of Dreams vs. Celebrate! A Street Party. This will usually wear off after a while if the show is any good, though. Subverted with Celebrate!'s replacement, Mickey's Soundsational Parade.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Epcot's</a> Imagination pavilion has Nigel Channing, who replaced Dreamfinder as the host of a revamp of its dark ride. Unusually for this trope, he predated the revamp; he was imported from the popular 3-D <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Audience</em> in an attempt to tie all of the pavillion's attractions together. Then again, the Journey Into Imagination revamps are largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> anyway, thanks in part to penny-pinching on the part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a> at the time.
</li><li> Also, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/StitchsGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/StitchsGreatEscape">Stitch's Great Escape!</a></em>, which replaced <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/ExtraTERRORestrialAlienEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/ExtraTERRORestrialAlienEncounter">ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter</a></em>. The horror show in the dark premise of the original production was replaced with a <em>comedy</em> show in the dark, which only served to annoy adults while still frightening children.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion">The Haunted Mansion</a></em> at Disneyland replaced their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">Mourning Bride character</a> with the more modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">Constance Hatchway</a>, with updated effects and a more sinister personality, casual park visitors responded fairly well to her, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">many</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">die hard</a> Mansion fans did not react well to the new character.
<ul><li> Similarly, while casual park visitors enjoy the seasonal <em>Haunted Mansion Holiday</em> overlay, die-hard Mansion fans dislike it based on the fact that Halloween would be the perfect time to enjoy the <em>normal</em> Mansion rather than one themed for Christmas.
</li></ul></li><li> Needless to say, countless fans were downright outraged when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheTwilightZoneTowerOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheTwilightZoneTowerOfTerror">The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</a></em> at Disney California Adventure was re-themed into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyMissionBreakout">Guardians of the Galaxy - MISSION: BREAKOUT</a></em> in 2017. At least the Florida version at Disney's Hollywood Studios still exists, and there's also a version at Walt Disney Studios Paris which is an identical clone of the California Tower of Terror<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3pqvk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3pqvk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3pqvk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, if it weren't for California Adventure needing an emergency attendance boost, Paris's Tower of Terror would've been built first</span>.
</li><li> This trope was taken to its extreme when in March 2018, it was announced that <em>a bug's land</em>, an under-traveled part of Disney California Adventure known primarily for run-of-the-mill children's rides, would be replaced with a long-awaited Marvel Land, which fans assumed would be placed in the empty land to the southeast of <em>Mission: Breakout</em>. Yes, either there were silent swaths of fans of <em>Heimlich's Chew Chew Train</em>, or Disney Theme Park fans run primarily off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>. Granted, the land <em>was</em> quite popular with parents of young children for that very reason, but given that Fantasyland has "gentle" rides while maintaining popularity with older guests, combined with the relative unpopularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife">A Bug's Life</a></em>, it was a given that the land would be given the ax in a park with such limited free real estate soon enough.
</li></ul></li><li> In late 2007, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a> closed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/BackToTheFutureTheRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/BackToTheFutureTheRide">Back to the Future: The Ride</a></em> to replace it with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheSimpsonsRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheSimpsonsRide">The Simpsons Ride</a></em>. To say that the fans of the former weren't happy is an understatement. This is the reason why the new ride's queue video loop includes an original segment in which Professor Frink attempts to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">to keep the Institute of Future Technology from being replaced with Krustyland</a>, and instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">ensures that it is</a>. From there, Doc Brown takes up Krusty's offer of employment at his park!

The negative reaction to these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Generation</a> 3.5 ponies may well have reached Hasbro, as the toys ran for only around one and a half years before they released Generation 4, which have proportions much closer to those of the original toys.

Although the quality of the sets themselves had improved, the lime/orange color scheme, less-memorable characters, and goofier Rock Monsters made <em>Power Miners</em> seem inferior to their predecessors.
</li><li> Way before the <em>BIONICLE</em> - <em>Hero Factory</em> debacle, LEGO received scorn for replacing their original foray into the world of buildable robotic action figures, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Slizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Slizer">Slizer</a></em>, with the much more esoteric <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/RoboRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/RoboRiders">RoboRiders</a></em>, which were weird-looking alien motorbikes instead of posable action figures.

</li><li> Rook also gets off a bit more lightly than the other two with his toy widely considered to be one of the best in the line.
</li><li> The highly unpopular "One-Step Changers" and other simplified <em>Transformers</em> merch aimed strictly at very young kids have replaced much of the "regular" toy lines in Europe in the early 2010s. Many large retailer chains carry them in mass quantities, with the more detailed and highly regarded <em>Generations</em> toys, which for years have been unavailable, still being rare and hard to find. The alleged reason for this distribution method is that there aren't as many older fans living in the affected territories as in the States or Japan, and low-quality, simplified toys based on current cartoons or movies are easier to sell to kids.

Gumbald is considered an uninteresting antagonist that lacks the Lich's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">menace</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">coolness</a>.

</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues">Blue's Clues</a></em> absolutely hate Joe for the simple fact that he replaced Steve, and for only that reason. It didn't help that the show underwent some major retooling not long after he was cast. Naturally, the actor took the brunt of the backlash despite having nothing to do with, say, live-action puppet sequences.

<ul><li> A case of this happening in-series is when Enzo has to replace Bob as guardian. Despite being just as competent at saving the day, the people think of the most inane reasons to dislike him. Like being green instead of blue.
</li><li> Also, in a bizarre case of meta-trope, certain Bootniks hated Matrix for "replacing" Enzo, despite him <em>being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">older version</a> of Enzo</em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp">abrupt transformation</a> was just too much for some oldschoolers to parse.
</li><li> Parodied in the second movie where Bob is believed to be a copy when another Bob, who looks and sounds more like the original shows up. This is particularly highlighted in the opening scene which takes place in front of a live audience. The audience cheers when any other character enters, but when Bob arrives, all we hear are the crickets chirping.

More importantly, the TOM models have increased in awesome over the years. TOM4's head and torso looks like they were ripped off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>, and his limbs looked like vacuum cleaner hoses. And they replaced SARA, his AI sidekick, with a couple of 'explorer robots'. Much earlier, TOM himself got hit with this when he introduced himself as "the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Moltar</a>".
<ul><li> Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Miguzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Miguzi">Miguzi</a> was seen as this due to the fact that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> and replaced Toonami on weekdays (Toonami was moved to Saturday nights only). It eventually fell out of this role, many viewers were sad to see it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> and has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>. Today, it's mostly seen as "a good idea that could have been executed better".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied when Kenny died "permanently" (he came back after one season), the three remaining boys took a previously minor character, Butters, as his replacement. They then proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">manipulate and torture him</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">constantly comparing him to their sadly missed Kenny to try to force him to do things their way</a>. After a few episodes they "fired" him for not being good enough, and replaced him with <em>another</em> minor character, Tweek. Interestingly, the boys warm up to him a lot quicker (aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Cartman</a>), even though he also vanished after a few episodes. Meanwhile Butters, despite being officially "demoted," actually wound up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> both in and out universe  even after Kenny's resurrection he continues to be a major character on par with the others, as well as quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, his relationship with the other boys is also developed somewhat (only a season later it is made clear the others at least like him a lot more than Cartman).
<ul><li> Also parodied in much earlier in "Succubus" when Chef quits his job as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">the school chef</a> and is replaced with a skinny white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> named Mr. Derp, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a> and believes that the viewers will love him as much as Chef.
</li><li> Within the fanbase, both Butters and Tweek had actually received backlash from fans that missed Kenny. When Butters had been replaced with Tweek (although it too wouldn't last long), his fans also cried foul and directed their anger at the other character. In the end after all was said and done, Butters' role continued to grow in the series while Tweek's appearances decreased, culminating in him vanishing from the classroom scenes in season 15.
</li></ul></li><li> Detective Yates gets this treatment for replacing the much funnier Officer Barbrady.

In one episode, Mandy and Grim replace Billy with a new friend named Bobby. The two of them wind up thinking Bobby is <em>better</em> than Billy ever was, much to Billy's horror. Eventually though, Billy destroyed Bobby with Grim's scythe, and Mandy doesn't even care, showing that even liking someone better than Billy doesn't mean she <em>likes</em> them.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> fans greatly dislike Oogtar the caveboy from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> cartoon, who was essentially an obnoxious replacement for a major character from the games (Toad, though granted, he didn't appear in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> game), despite the fact that no cavepeople, including Oogtar, ever appeared in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> video game. Didn't help that the cartoon already had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Yoshi</a> for that kind of role, meaning Oogtar was completely pointless.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFantasticFour1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFantasticFour1978">The Fantastic Four (1978)</a></em> was in development, a prior contract with Universal was already in place for a potential Human Torch movie, which kept him from being used. So they replaced him with HERBIE (above pic), Reed Richards' assistant robot. The irony here is that Johnny Storm was originally a replacement himself. Oddly, fans didn't mind when HERBIE was added to the comics. The Torch <em>wasn't</em> kept out of those.
</li><li> Dimmy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSnorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSnorks">The Snorks</a></em> was written out of the scripts after season two. At the same time Corky, Big Weed, and Lil Seaweed were introduced.
</li><li> During the ninth season of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> cartoon, the Shredder and his crew were replaced by invading alien Lord Dregg, who took over as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> during the show's last two seasons. While capably voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay">Tony Jay</a> and arguably more menacing and effective than the Shredder, many fans found that he lacked the charm of his predecessors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> webisodes, Jay Sherman's new make-up lady/girlfriend Jennifer is this, replacing his original make-up woman Doris and his <em>actual</em> girlfriend Alice Tompkins, both of whom are loved characters from the original TV series. In this case, the substitution itself was mildly justified because neither character's voice actor was available (Doris's had died and Alice's had retired).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied in the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"; when Barney replaces Wiggum in the titular band, Wiggum spitefully organises a gang of fans to picket their next gig shouting "Wiggum forever! Barney never!" at the stage, while Wiggum watches with a smug smile on his face. Then Barney opens his mouth, reveals he can sing ten times better than Wiggum, and the chants immediately switch to "Barney forever! Wiggum never!" Wiggum ends up slinking out of the bar unnoticed. Like most of the episode, this parodies a similar situation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> faced (specifically, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> replaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">Pete Best</a>).
</li><li> Also parodied in the infamous episode "The Principal and the Pauper" where Principal Skinner is revealed to be an impostor named Armin Tamzarian who assumed Skinner's identity when the latter was assumed dead. The real Skinner (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinSheen">Martin Sheen</a>) takes Armin's place as principal while Armin leaves town. However, despite the real Skinner being a nice and reasonable fellow, the other Springfield citizens decide to kick him out of town (even his <em>mother</em> who preferred the doormat Armin to the independent Seymour) and get a judge to order everyone never speak of this again under penalty of torture because they preferred the old Skinner. There's a reason most fans (and some writers) follow suit and pretend this episode never happened.
</li><li> Parodied in the "Behind The Laughter" episode which explains that, while Bart was serving jail time for assaulting a flight attendant, his role was taken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a> and said episodes proved highly unpopular.
</li><li> Happened to Marge's current German voice actress Anke Engelke  she took over after Marge's original voice Elisabeth Volkmann passed away in 2006. This also happened to Christoph Jablonka, the new voice actor for Homer Simpson since Norbert Gastell, who was almost universally beloved by German Simpsons fans, died at the (admittedly quite proud) age of 86.
</li><li> This also happens a lot in the Brazilian dub, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the studio constantly replaces the voice actors for any reason</a>. The most emblematic case was in 2007, when Homer's voice actor Waldyr Sant'Anna was withdrawn from the series due to a lawsuit he had moved against Fox, due to the unauthorized use of his voice in <em>The Simpsons</em> DVD box sets. Shortly before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">the movie</a>, he was replaced by Carlos Alberto, who inevitably received heavy backlash from the Brazilian fans.
</li><li> Gil Gunderson is often seen as one for Lionel Hutz, as he fills the same role of an incompetent authority figure who's usually on the side of the family. After the tragic death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a>, Gil tended to assume the role of the family's attorney in any court-related episodes, but with Hutz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">charming idiocy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">slimeball panache</a> replaced by a whiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser">Straw Loser</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> fandom, many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie">A Goofy Movie</a></em> are not fond of Mona. Roxanne was Max's high-school sweetheart, the girl he strives to get with the entire movie. Come the sequel, she's nowhere to be found though that's because Max goes to college. The last time she was seen was in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em>. Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeysTwiceUponAChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeysTwiceUponAChristmas">Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas</a></em>, he's exiting college and has a new girlfriend, Mona. Mona comes off as a Replacement Scrappy, though almost ten in-series years has passed since <em>A Goofy Movie</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> fandom went through this phase with the announcement of the fourth season and the fact that there would be a new cast replacing the old one, and needless to say, it did NOT going well for fans of the original cast.
<ul><li> When it was announced that Don would be the host for "The Ridonculous Race", many fans that liked Chris McLean did not take the news very well.

Expect the main protagonists of future generations to be this to that gen. Noticeable examples tend to be Firefly vs Rainbow Dash and Surprise vs Pinkie, since the latter ponies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">heavily based</a> on those ponies.

This died down during Season 7 which showed she got a different story direction, distinct personality, own characters dynamics, and <em>far</em> less time in the spotlight, but if it redeemed her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">is contentious</a>.
</li><li> The Cutie Mark Crusader's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> had effectively concluded by Season 7, so in Season 8 they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfRepresentatives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartyOfRepresentatives">the Young Six</a> Gallus, Silverstream, Smolder, Yona, Sandbar, and Ocellus. While they had fans and were liked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> their respective species cultures, many found them comparatively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">Flat Characters</a> who never got the chance to endear themselves like the Crusaders did.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>, Fasttrack is highly disliked among the fanbase, due to his powers and coloration seeming <em>very</em> similar to that of XLR8, who is a fan favorite and a series mainstay since the original show. There had been other "replacement" Omnitrix forms before, but they always had unique traits that let them develop voices of their own; Fasttrack <em>didn't</em> have that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>'s claims that he's faster and stronger have provoked a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">favoritism</a> accusations.
<ul><li> It seems most of the show's staff didn't like him that much either, seeing as he was <em>deliberately</em> left out of the next series, <em>Omniverse</em>, which had made a point to bring almost every form back.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em>Omniverse</em>, the villains of the show suffered this. The first new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was Malware, an scary and amoral mechamorph who was beloved by fans. When he was defeated, he was replaced with characters like the Incurseans, the Rooters, and Maltruant. None of the new villains were able to generate even remotely the level of interest that Malware had, being seen as pale imitations. One of the biggest reasons for the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> was that Malware's absence left a directionless hole that couldn't be filled. Worse yet, the show was cancelled just as Malware was set to return in a big way.

Rodimus was not only not accepted because he wasn't Optimus, was partly responsible for the death of his predecessor and sometimes insecure over his leadership abilities, when he wasn't also being sharply sarcastic. However, Rodimus Prime also has a share of fans who like him <em>better</em> than Optimus, for the very same qualities he's hated for. To a lesser degree the rest of the 1986 Transformers cast brought in after the movie suffered from this, as many of the beloved older characters had been killed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">to sell toys</a> or just weren't shown anymore.
<ul><li> Rodimus did however, notably have a big Jerkass moment in one episode where unable to free an alien planet from the Decepticons, he instead choose to blow it up, and then commented Cybertron would be a better for "not being so perfect" after one of the other Autobots lamenting the fact they just depraved an alien species of their home.
</li><li> Most of the Season 3 cast developed strong followings, mostly thanks to getting a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a> compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd">Cast Herd</a> of earlier seasons. However, very few defenders exist for Daniel and Wheelie, who filled the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">younger robot</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a>" slot previously filled by Spike and Bumblebee. Spike and Bumblebee are considered by a lot of fans to be how to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid-Appeal Character</a> <em>right</em>, with their understated roles, genuine competence, and charming eagerness. On the other hand, Daniel and Wheelie are considered to be how to do it <em>wrong</em> - Daniel, for being <em>too</em> young, constantly crying, and acting like an idiot, Wheelie, for his dorky design, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime">constantly rhyming,</a> and having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">tracker/survivalist</a> elements of his character constantly downplayed in favor of making him Robot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUS">Dennis the Menace</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Transformers</em> in general suffers from this, as every new series, new character, new toy, and so on inevitably gets compared to <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/GEEWUN">GEEWUN<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Classics and Universe lines have taken it to whole new levels, with Astrotrain and Powerglide's <em>color schemes</em> receiving Replacement Scrappy status.
</li><li> Though with the color schemes, it's a bit more justified: the Classics figures are of the G1 characters (the G1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersGenerationOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersGenerationOne">Dreamwave Comics</a> series was underway) with today's toy technology - in the 80s, "transformation" sometimes meant "stand it on its side," and a lot of characters didn't look like their toys, to the point where you simply <em>can't have</em> your favorite in toy form; just some <em>thing</em> that turns into a vehicle that's vaguely similar if you squint. The fandom then heard that all their favorites were getting more accurate and poseable and generally awesomer figures... and then they see that they've been given "improved" color schemes that <em>brought them right back down to</em> "I can't have Powerglide, just something that turns into a similar vehicle." See Twilight Sparkle above. However, almost all of those figures have since had show-accurate repaints.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> developed Optimus Primal into some sort of religious leader, while Cheetor stepped up into his place as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader">Supporting Leader</a>. The new writers introduced Nightscream to fill in Cheetor's old role as the kid. Unfortunately, Cheetor was <em>designed</em> to grow from a annoying and kinda dumb newbie to a capable fighter and leader, while Nightscream was just annoying and kinda dumb.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, despite the usual reaction it got from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a>, quickly became a fan favorite - and then, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">swiftly canceled - toyline and all</a> - for a very... polarizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">movie</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">next series</a> was already catching some flak just based on the preview images for being extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries">Movie-based</a>. Needless to say, <em>Animated</em> fans were not pleased. After more designs and characters had been revealed, many of them very <em>Animated</em>-like, fans have begun to see <em>Prime</em> as some kind of copycat, an inferior, pandering substitute at best. However after the show had actually started airing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">many fans changed their mind about the ordeal</a>, calling <em>Prime</em> the best thing ever, especially those that hated <em>Animated</em> to begin with. But never mind that, even some (former) <em>Animated</em> fans were declaring its cancellation a good riddance!
<ul><li> This is about par for the course with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a> of Transformers. Every new series is the worst ever until you get used to it and see it for more than just the changes. That's when Hasbro, being Hasbro, pulls another reboot just as the series is spreading its wings (they prefer to overhaul the toyline every couple of years or so.) and the process repeats. There are always those who consider it their religious duty to hate <em>everything</em> that isn't G1 just for not being G1.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Princess Sally, Sonic's love interest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">the Archie comics</a>, sometimes gets flack from some fans for supposedly being a "replacement" for the video games' Amy Rose - though this isn't exactly fair, seeing as the idea that Amy was a major character by the time of Sally's introduction is far from true. In fact, the American manual for Amy's debut, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em>, actually refers to Amy as Princess Sally in an effort to tie-in with the show, indicating that, for Americans, Princess Sally preceded (or at least appeared around the same time as) Amy Rose.
<ul><li> Amy <em>was</em> already a major character at the time in Japan. The reason she was unknown in America is because <em>Sonic CD</em>, which introduced Amy to Western Audiences (name change notwithstanding), had its American release delayed by several months, during which time the US-centric comics and cartoon started up. Amy's renaming in the American manual has since received an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon">Orwellian Retcon</a>, and Sega pretends it never happened.
</li></ul></li><li> While not a character example, try finding any fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> who <em>didn't</em> hate Myles Jeffrey's portrayal as T.J. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessTakingTheFifthGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessTakingTheFifthGrade">Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade</a></em> and <em>Recess: All Growed Down</em>, the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> movies released in 2003 after the show ended. Due to T.J.'s previous voice actor, Andrew Lawrence, going through puberty in-between the time the last episode was produced and the time the two DTV movies were produced, he was replaced with Myles Jeffrey, who gets tons of flack from almost the entirety of the fanbase due to his portrayal of T.J. having a much higher voice with less of the emotion Andrew Lawrence gave him. Some fans even find it frustrating as at the time (2002-2003), Disney did have some child voice actors who sounded enough like Andrew Lawrence's T.J. This trope was actually avoided when Andrew Lawrence replaced Ross Malinger as the voice of T.J. at the beginning of season two, due to Ross Malinger's voice breaking. Some fans even thought that Andrew Lawrence was an even better voice for T.J.. Also could be contributing to the fact that the second season is widely considered to be the point where the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grew the beard</a>.
</li><li> Another voice actor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>: Arnold had four voice actors throughout the series (five if you count the pilot episode), but his final voice actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexDLinz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexDLinz">Alex D. Linz</a> is near-universally disliked by the fandom for two reasons. One, Linz's voice was higher-pitched than the previous actors making Arnold sound too young (much like Myles Jeffery above). Two, he replaced Spencer Klein, who most fans consider to be <em>the</em> Arnold despite the fact that Klein was the third person to voice him <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zwmt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5zwmt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zwmt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though he lasted the longest, his take on Arnold is how fanfic writers usually portray him and unlike his predecessors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaneToran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaneToran">Toran Caudell</a> and Phillip Van Dyke, Klein did not portray any other character after his voice broke.</span> and played Arnold when he was at his most bland (as Arnold became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaProtagonist">Vanilla Protagonist</a> to allow other characters to develop). Linz only voices Arnold in the last three episodes and when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">The Jungle Movie</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a>, they cast Mason Vale Cotton (who sounds closer to the others) as Arnold.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima">Legends of Chima</a></em> is widely considered this by fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago">Ninjago</a></em> (<em>Chima</em> began the same year <em>Ninjago</em> was originally intended to end) and the 2011 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">ThunderCats</a></em> (the main character of <em>Chima</em> is Lion-O in LEGO form, even though the similarities end there). It's gotten to the point where the art director for <em>ThunderCats 2011</em> thinks that <em>Chima</em> is a <em>ThunderCats</em> knock-off.
</li><li> Roy's fate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> was sealed from the moment the fandom's infamous Nabu fangirls first discovered his existence, thinking it would ruin any chance of the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding">just hiding</a>. It also didn't help that he was a <em>massive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">Flat Character</a> with no personality.

<ul><li> The show made the decision to kill Brian to bring in the character of Vinny. They shouldn't have, because within <em>hours</em> of the episode's airing angry fans reacted exactly how one would expect them to. (It doesn't really help that Vinny is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">an Italian-American stereotype</a>, either.) Turns out it didnt stick.
</li><li> It wasn't meant to last anyway. Not only did Vinny only last 4 episodes (which is 4 weeks of airing compared to the usual half year of production the episodes go through), but titles and plots of later episodes would show Brian would return eventually.
</li><li> And bringing things to an ironic full circle, <em>Brian</em> ended up becoming one to Vinny. After Brian was brought back, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">he took a </a><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">huge</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">level in Jerkass</a>, with episodes like "Herpe, the Love Sore," "Brian's a Bad Father," and "Brian the Closer" being cited as especially low points for him.

<ul><li> Emily was considered to be this by some fans for a while, the need for a prominent female character leading her to take the role of eighth Steam Team member, which left Duck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>. Some fans also considered her introduction pointless due to the existence of Daisy and Mavis, two female characters who were popular with the fans, were well-developed and had interesting personalities. Especially telling is that while Emily was promoted to main cast in Season 8, there was no effort made to make the other female characters (not even the coaches) more prominent, thus defeating the intention to be politically correct. She ended up being a fairly popular, or at least tolerable, character once most of the fanbase warmed up to her. The "Emily replaced Duck!" issue was acknowledged in a rather cruel light in Season 18's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS18E8DuckAndTheSlipCoaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS18E8DuckAndTheSlipCoaches">Duck and the Slip Coaches</a>", where Emily comes to the sheds twice and finds them full due to Duck taking residence for those nights. These scenes alone caused quite a ruckus.
</li><li> Nia and Rebecca, two new female engines introduced to the series in <em>Big World! Big Adventures!</em> (aka Season 22) get a lot of flak for replacing Edward and Henry, two of the main members of the Steam Team. Most of the reasons why Nia and Rebecca are hated include: being created solely to add more female members to the main cast, satisfying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> who criticised the series for being sexist and misogynistic, having one-dimensional character traits, having a generic friendly personality, designs that look out-of-place with the main cast, overdesigned liveries designed purely for eye candy towards young children, as well as Nia being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a> designed in an attempt to please People of Colour (coupled with Nias voice actress being black-skinned and of African background). Some fans even slam both of the new girls as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sues</a> due to a lack of character flaws.

They're more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base Breakers</a> than true Scrappies though. For one Riot is a male lead singer, when previously all the bands were all-female. More important though is Riot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">likes Jem</a>. He's indifferent to Jerrica but loves her alter ego Jem, saying she is the perfect women and he is the perfect man so they are destined for each other. Jem was already in a confusing love triangle involving Rio and herself, nevermind Riot and Minx (who wants Rio). There's also the issue that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">beloved</a> Misfits were put on the bench for The Stingers.
