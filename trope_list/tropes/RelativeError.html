<ul><li> In one of the many commercials John Stamos (Uncle Jesse from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>) did for Dannon Oikos yogurt, the woman he was seeing had apparently broken up with him and was surprised to see how well he was taking it as he indulged in his yogurt. But when an attractive woman then walks in, she is suddenly aghast that he seemingly found another girlfriend so quickly, smashing a picture. He informs her that the other woman is actually his sister and that the picture she smashed happened to be of their mother.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears">True Tears</a></em>, episode 3: Shinichiro sees Noe ride off on a motorcycle with another guy, who he assumes is her boyfriend. He finds out otherwise when he takes her to a basketball game and sees the same guy...
<div class="indent"><strong>Shinichiro:</strong> (to his guy friend) That's him! That number four. He's Noe's... <br/><strong>Noe:</strong> Brother! <br/><strong>Shinichiro:</strong> ...brother. (pause) Brother?!
</div></li><li> Used as the final reveal in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat">Di Gi Charat</a> Winter Garden</em> spinoff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em> plays with this one: After Harima sees Tenma and Karasuma together, he sulks in his room and ends up watching "Comet Wars", which mirrors the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> use of this trope. Harima suddenly realizes he may have made this mistake and that Karasuma is Tenma's brother... but later realizes he was just fooling himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMonster">Love Monster</a></em>, Hiyo assumes that Kurou is flirting with Chiya, but in reality, he just found out Chiya is his sister. Later on in the story, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> situation occurs where Chiya does actually try to pursue a relationship with Kurou, which is perfectly acceptable in monster society. Kurou is not interested, however.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Krillin mistakenly believes that Android 17 and 18 are a couple rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins">Half-Identical Twins</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em>, Akihisa attempts to keep his sister who has just recently moved home hidden from his friends for fear of her embarrassing him. When they start getting suspicious and go to his house they believe that he has a secret live-in girlfriend, much to Himeji's denial: "Akihisa-kun, this bra is way too big for you. You need a smaller cup size."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em>, Omi and Sakura both assume that Aya-chan is their Aya's lover when they find out he's been taking care of a girl in a coma and using her name. The <em>Assassin and White Shaman</em> manga has a scene where Aya-chan forces her brother to leave his job early and buy her something to eat, and his coworker, implying that this has happened before, assumes she's his girlfriend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BetrayalKnowsMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BetrayalKnowsMyName">Betrayal Knows My Name</a></em>: Toko and Tsukumo Murasame seem to fit this, even going so far as to sleep in the same bed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em>: In Episode 5 , when Emi yells at Aichi for not doing his homework with her , Kamui thinks thinks the two are a couple,whereas in reality , they are siblings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used in the English dub to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">Hide Your Lesbians</a>. Serena and Mina mistake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Amara</a> for a man and assume 'he' is dating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">Michelle</a> when they are actually cousins. Of course in the original Japanese they <em>were</em> a couple and the dub didn't edit out that many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">couple-y scenes between them</a>.
</li><li> Another variation in the <em>R</em> season. Serena/Usagi spots Darien/Mamoru giving another girl a lift and assumes he's found another girlfriend. The girl turns out not to be his sister but rather Andrew/Motoki's sister though the set-up remains the same. The sister has a boyfriend already anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em> has a variation when Mylene visits Max Jenius on the bridge to talk to him. She's never been on the bridge before, and after they leave to talk in private, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies">Bridge Bunnies</a> go into a frenzy over Max's new "girlfriend" who is so much younger than he is, some of them scandalized and others grudgingly admiring Max for attracting someone so young and beautiful. Then Exsedol cuts in and informs them all that Mylene is Max's <em>daughter</em>. (Mylene's somewhat risque manner of dress probably wasn't helping matters.)
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool">High School</a></em> when the other Pop Music Club members see Jun meet a guy. Three of them think he's her boyfriend, but Ui is unsure, having heard she has a brother, but they assume "boyfriend status confirmed" when she squeezes his arm. But then they learn after confronting them that he actually is her brother Atsushi.
</li><li> A horrific one occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, where Kaede mistakes Kouta's sister for his girlfriend. She promptly kills her and his father.
</li><li> It is possible to see this trope at work in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em>, counting Rei's affection for Shinji as purely maternal - if this is the case, Asuka makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">fateful error</a>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em>: Shouya meets a boy who says he's Shouko's boyfriend. The awkward part is that Shouko is around seventeen while the kid is a middle schooler. As in turns out the two are related, with Yuzuru being Shouko's overprotective little <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">sister</a></em>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TokyoMagnitude8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TokyoMagnitude8">Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</a></em>, a man mistakes Mari for Yuuki's and Mirai's mother. She doesn't react negatively and when Mirai complains about it later she just mentions her own young daughter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan">Himouto! Umaru-chan</a></em>, when Umaru and Taihei go out in public, bystanders often get jealous of Taihei, thinking that the beautiful Umaru is his girlfriend instead of his sister.
</li><li> Shiba Tatsuya and Shiba Miyuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool">The Irregular at Magic High School</a></em> are a pair of rather <em>affectionate</em> siblings. So much so that even their innocuous conversation with each other creates an atmosphere that makes others think about incest. It is no wonder that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Ichijou Masaki</a> mistook them for lovers when he first met them. His startled realization that they are actually siblings is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, at the same time, in the future, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we first learn about the incestuous feelings of Miyuki, and then that Tatsuya is ready to try to love her as a woman. In general, at the moment they are engaged after a series of events ..</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory">My Love Story!!</a></em>, a man named Oda confesses to Ai and gets turned down because Ai is still in love with Takeo. He goes to meet Takeo however mistakes Suna, Ai's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> younger brother, for Takeo. Ai described Takeo as very attractive looking however Takeo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">isn't what Oda expected</a>.
</li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonariNoKashiwagiSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonariNoKashiwagiSan">Tonari no Kashiwagi-san</a></em>. Yuuta sees his crush Kotone with Kotori's husband Takuya and initially believes that there's cheating afoot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">unaware of the fact that Kotone and Kotori are sisters</a>. The misunderstanding gets cleared up almost immediately.
</li><li> Invoked with Miki and her brother Kazuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em>. Love, Inori, and even Miki's admirer Yuuki mistake Kazuki for her boyfriend on multiple occasions, and he plays along to keep other boys from hitting on her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Implied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Implied">Implied</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: After the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore">his prostitute mother</a>, Levi is taken in by Kenny Ackerman, who simply states that he knew her in the past. As time goes on Levi finds evidence that he is also part of the Ackerman family, and while not stated explicitly, it's easy to read Levi as suspecting that Kenny might be his father. When Levi finally asks Kenny how he knew his mother, he laughs and explains that she was his sister, making him Levi's uncle (something which the audience already knew).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>: When Renka shows up, she furiously attacks Kensei. Given that Kensei is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>, Kenichi immediately assumes that Renka is a disgrunted ex-girlfriend. An annoyed and disgusted Kensei explains that Renka is his daughter who is attacking him for abandoning the family.

An upper-class, white Catholic family has four daughters, three of whom have married an Algerian Muslim, a Sephardic Jew, and a Chinese Taoist. The final daughter is in a relationship with a Catholic... who's black. The three brothers-in-law take pictures of the fiancé with an attractive woman outside a hotel while in Paris, blissfully unaware of the hypocrisy of assigning stereotypes. When they show the sister the pictures, she asks what the hell is wrong with them, that's his <em>sister</em>. They genuinely apologize to him and do what they can to reconcile the families (as the fiancé's father is as opposed to his son marrying a white girl as her father to his daughter marrying a black guy).
