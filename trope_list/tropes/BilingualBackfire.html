<ul><li> An ad for... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereTheySellingAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereTheySellingAgain">something</a> had two women in a café discussing a rather good-looking man at their table in Irish. Turned out he also spoke the language.
</li><li> There are multiple very similar commercials about people, frequently women, unexpectedly knowing Morse code:
<ul><li> There was a Swedish Army commercial, shown in Britain on <em>Tarrant on TV</em>, in which two Army recruits sit on a park bench and tap out sexist remarks about a passing girl in Morse code. Guess what — she taps out a snappy comeback on a nearby lamp post. Yes, there are women in the Army too.
</li><li> In a similar commercial, two women sit on a park bench and two male Army recruits are passing by. The insulting thing they tapped out on the bench in Morse code was that one of the guys was going to take one of the women and the other guy was going to take "the spare". The two women then tapped out something to the effect of "I don't think so" and "Get lost", and they walked away as the sound of gunfire played on the soundtrack. Whoops, turns out the two women (quite feminine in their soft pastels and pleated skirts) were in the Army too! (It also aired on an edition of <em>Carrot's Commercial Breakdown</em>.)
<ul><li> This may be the famous promo for the British Army, the one which describes "learning things others don't know."
</li></ul></li><li> A similar Snapple juice ad featured two students trying to communicate by snapping the vacuum seals on their bottle caps, until the teacher interrupts them with a message of her own.
</li><li> Another Morse Code gag shows up in a beer commercial from the early 90s: a man uses an LED light to signal to a woman in a bar that he finds her very attractive. Unfortunately, between her and him is a crusty old sailor who does not take kindly to being hit on...
</li></ul></li><li> There is a Dutch commercial wherein a family enters an Italian restaurant, and the waiters talk about them quite rudely. Cue the father turning around towards them and saying "Hey, pastaclown, if you're done talking to your girlfriends, perhaps you could spare some time for us?" in fluent Italian.
</li><li> Inverted in an ad for Meteor that had an Irish guy try to chat up a girl in Spain by getting his sister to feed him pick up lines in (bad) Spanish, "I admire your dentistry" and "Are you homeless". Then it turns out the girl is actually English, doesn't understand Spanish and finds the language sexy.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/FikAABy7VA4">2012 ad for Honda<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is set in a dealership. The customers start speaking subtitled Chinese (probably so the salesman won't know how much they want the car). They switch to English to tell him they'll take it. He tells them in Chinese to follow him and they'll start the paperwork.

He tried to drop him off right in front, which he wasn't supposed to do. When the principal came up and told him so, Gabriel tried to get out of it by speaking rapid-fire Spanish at her. She then proceeds to repeat her instructions in perfect (if accented) Spanish, ending it with "Yo no soy pendeja." ("I'm not stupid")

This trope comes into play when he becomes fluent merely from observing them, just in time to give a witty response after they've insulted his mother. On the other hand, Ahmed is a scholar who already knows at least four languages, and it's implied he had a month or two of observing in which to learn, gradually picking up a word here and a phrase there.

</li><li> Earlier in the film, Landa is cautious about this trope but finds that he doesn't need to be concerned because the family under the floor didn't react to any of the English he and Pierre La Padite spoke.

</li><li> Hungarian movie <em>Valami Amerika</em> ("<em>A kind of America</em>") revolves around a Hungarian director of TV commercials and video clips, who's trying to convince an American producer of his skills at directing in order to get funding for the movie he's written. Of course, the producer is actually of Hungarian birth, which is revealed at the very start of the movie to the audience, but only much later to the characters.
</li><li> Used as a plot point in the Spanish-language film <em>Ladron que Roba a Ladron</em> ("<em>Thief who Steals from a Thief</em>"). One of the titular thieves pretends not to speak English to an American security guard, who snaps at him "You're in America, speak English." The thief then hears them talking about the security layout of the building, and as he leaves, shoots over his shoulder "Excuse me, senor? You're in America. Speak Spanish."

One watches the scene expecting that any minute now, it will be revealed that Carrie knows sign language herself and has understood everything—but it never happens.

At that point, Douglas (a bit angry) snaps that Mr. Wu can get the car, but must allow Douglas to drive Herbie in the El Dorado race. Mr. Wu gets the winnings, but Douglas gets to buy back Herbie for a dollar. This prompts Mr. Wu to say loudly in English, "Now you speak my language!" It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a>, coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, which the entire movie runs on.
</li><li> In <em>What's Cooking</em>, a film about four families on one street corner at thanksgiving, the Hispanic family are introduced to the Vietnamese boyfriend of the daughter.

She's given a chance to step in and replace a celebrity chef at a brand new, big money restaurant. The celebrity chef's staff pretty much hold her in contempt. The sous chef, who probably expected as the "second in command" of the restaurant to step into the top spot when the celebrity left, says loudly and in French, "The truffles are probably wasted on her!" Later in the film, this trope is brought into play as Gellar's character issues her orders for the night and begins with, "You... the one who thinks I don't know how to speak French... you're in charge of the truffles. That way I won't <em>waste</em> them."

When Merlin finally let them know he spoke their language, all he said was, "Stand away from the fire." Then he <strong>showed</strong> them who he was and what he could do to them by igniting a massive fire with a glance.

<div class="indent"><em>I cannot remember the epigram exactly, but the sense of it was: "Antonia is old-fashioned: she does not buy a pet marmoset at great expense from an Eastern trader. And why? Because she breeds them herself." Athenodorus thought for a moment and replied severely in the same metre: "Antonia, so far from buying a pet marmoset from Eastern traders, does not even cosset and feed with sugar-plums the poor child of her noble husband." Augustus looked somewhat abashed. I should explain that neither he nor Athenodorus, to whom I had always been represented as a half-wit, guessed that I could understand what they were saying. So Athenodorus drew me towards him and said playfully in Latin: "And what does young Tiberius Claudius think about the matter?" I was sheltered from Augustus by Athenodorus's big body and somehow forgot my stammer. I said straight out, in Greek: "My mother Antonia does not pamper me, but she has let me learn Greek from someone who learned it directly from Apollo."</em>

Robyn takes leave in elegant German and they realize their scheme has been rumbled, allowing Vic to buy the newer model at the same price. A key point in the novel as this triumph brings the previously mutually antagonistic Vic and Robyn together.

It turns out that Peter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot">speaks eight languages</a> and is teaching himself yet another one.

He also surprises Mark Smeaton by reminding him of unsavory gossip Smeaton passed while speaking Flemish (although that wasn't intentional as Cromwell had been eavesdropping at the time).

It turns out that her son and daughter-in-law already know this, but are keeping it from his mother since they thought it would kill her. The doctor disagrees, but their argument quickly becomes a moot-point since they argued in front of the mother and she catches the meaning of "cancer".

And the patrons would clap, and they'd move on to the next table.

<ul><li> Colonel Mitchell manages to catch Jackson on this in one episode, when Jackson and a Chinese diplomat are conversing about the team in the latter's native tongue. They insult him in Mandarin, only for him to reply "Screw You" in Mandarin. This is a double backfire, as the Chinese diplomat's Chinese is completely incomprehensible (the actress is actually Japanese, not Chinese) and Daniel's Chinese is perfectly understandable, if a little accented, as is Cameron's.
</li><li> Inverted when they go back in time and are captured by the US military of 1969. The officer in charge asks (in Russian) if they are Soviet spies. Daniel naturally responds "Nyet", and then a moment later realized it was a mistake.

The funny thing is, he reveals this when he gets fed up with two other characters bad-mouthing him for his lecherous behavior (not realizing that he can understand them) and blurts out an angry retort.

But when Andy questions the woman about her symptoms, she seems confused by her responses. Suddenly, Andy switches back to English and tells the girl to cut the crap—she's been asking her about pain and/or trouble breathing and the girl keeps responding with "oui" (yes) or "non" (no), essentially telling her that she can't breathe at all. As it turns out the girl isn't French, just an actress, and can't understand a word that Andy's been saying.
</li><li> In <em>True Stories of the ER</em>, a young female doctor is sent to a Greek woman and her family. Little did the family know, the doctor spoke Greek fluently. The patient only speaks Greek and begins insulting the doctor and refusing tests. Not wanting to offend them, she waits until the woman is cured until she reveals she speaks Greek too.

<ul><li> In one episode, when a Japanese executive belittles Sam and Callen to his entourage and calls a woman in Japan to tell her to "answer the cops' questions" Sam informs him in Japanese "You wish I was just a cop." He then takes the phone and converses with the woman in fluent Japanese while the executive stares.

"You guys better get out of here before I rape you in the ass with this knife!" is what he shouts, brandishing a knife out of nowhere.

She claims to not know, but when her phone rings, proceeds to talk to the other person in Spanish, obviously assuming that neither detective will understand her. When she hangs up, Detective Green talks to her in Spanish, revealing that he knows the language and HAS understood everything she just said to other person. The audience never finds out exactly what either of them say, but given her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> reaction and Green's tone of voice, it seems obvious that she was lying and that Green is warning her to cooperate, lest she face jail time herself.

<ul><li> An inverted version. Several deaf persons are suspects in the murder of a doctor who performed cochlear implants. In one scene, the detectives are at a skating rink, observing the "conversation" between two of the suspects. When Goren asks the police interpreter to tell him what they're "saying", the man refuses, but Goren points out that in a public place, the two have no right to privacy. Unfortunately, the two realize the cops are talking about them—Goren's staring at them and his attempts to hide his mouth so they cannot read his lips tip them off, and promptly tone down their signing gestures, leaving the interpreter unable to decipher what they're "saying". A later scene has another suspect "talking" with his lawyer. This time it's the district attorney who demands that the interpreter reveal the details of the "conversation", trying to use the same "in plain sight" loophole, but this time, the interpreter stands firm in his refusal to translate, as that would violate attorney-client privilege.
</li><li> Another episode had a Hispanic woman warning her little girl in Spanish that "people with big eyes get hurt", obviously fearing for her daughter's safety should she reveal what she knows about a murder. At this point Detective Barek reveals her fluency in Spanish by gently urging the woman to let her daughter tell what she knows.

</li><li> Another episode has the team investigation a possible molestation in the Orthodox Jewish community. The Orthodox Jewish leaders attempt to run interference with Hebrew pamphlets and conversations in Yiddish advising community members against cooperating with the secular police. Munch is fluent in both Hebrew and Yiddish, so their attempts are exposed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> did something similar, when Scotty attempted to talk with a potential witness, who pretended not to understand English—nor the fluent Spanish that Scotty then spoke to him in. Only the threat of a call to immigration—no doubt the very reason he was keeping his mouth shut—got him to talk.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnDoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnDoe">John Doe</a></em> has the police station taken hostage by an ex-cop who wants something from the evidence lockers. As he's planning his escape, he converses in Farsi on the phone. Unfortunately for him, the titular character has the total sum of human knowledge in his head, including every language. Not only does he translate what he heard to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce">Friend on the Force</a>, but he also explains that the "Bedouin Prince" is not a person but a ship.

The couple argue with each other in Russian about whether or not to tell the police what happened; Captain Renard calmly interjects in Russian, making the question moot. For reference, Sasha Roiz (the actor who plays him) is the son of Russian immigrants, so his Russian is pretty good, if accented.

This includes her first meeting with Eyal Lavin, a Mossad agent. After learning she dumped the briefcase she was supposed to give him, he goes on an unsubtitled rant in Hebrew. A few minutes later, she speaks a phrase in Hebrew. His expression is priceless. However, in one episode, this works against her. Her attempt to infiltrate an organization results in her meeting its boss, who takes a call in front of her and speaks Turkish into the phone. Naturally, Annie understands, but the woman later reveals that he guessed by Annie's body language that she understood, which was part of the reason her cover was blown.

</div></li><li> Israeli early 90s cult teen drama <em>Lo Kolel Sherut</em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> (one of many, actually) in its second season, featuring a Russian immigrant who comes to work at the café where the series takes place as a cleaner. Back in those days, as the USSR was just collapsing, former Soviet Jews immigrated to Israel en masse (along with people with Jewish parents or grandparents, who could still immigrate easily using the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return">Law of Return<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). When the staff were told he did not speak Hebrew, they started speaking somewhat bluntly about him around him, some making disparaging comments while others were more supportive, reflecting the actual variety of attitudes prevalent at the time (and two female waitresses talked about finding him attractive). Soon enough, however, some of the staff overhears him speaking Hebrew on the phone, and at the end of the episode he reveals that he does speak the language (albeit with some mistakes), and didnt at first because he was shy. He quickly patches things up even with the ones who made particularly mean comments, but decides he does not want to keep working there.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, when Joy asks Catalina how to say something in "Mexican". Catalina obliges by giving her a very wrong, insult-filled translation that would only get Joy into trouble. Joy immediately knows Catalina is trying to pull a fast one, because the Spanish word for "bitch" was used, and Joy has been called a bitch in every language on Earth.
</li><li> On an episode of National Geographic's <em>Drugs Inc</em>, US Border Patrol agents in Detroit find some drugs in a car and driver tells the passenger, in Spanish, to say that the drugs belonged to the passenger instead of the driver. The agent looks amused for a moment and then turns to the driver and says (in English) "So the drugs really belong to you, then?"

Phryne merely compliments the meal she'd served them in the same language, prompting the grandmother to stalk away in embarrassment.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> telefilm, Horatio and his four men end up in a longboat with a dozen Frenchman after his prize vessel sinks under them. Horatio makes the ship's erstwhile captain swear not to make trouble. Then he asks the captain to have his crew swear. The captain tells them, in French, to wait for his order to seize control. Horatio feigns ignorance by asking what they said, but quietly begins plotting a false course on the chart so that they won't be able to reach shore after the inevitable takeover.

Two hostages plot to run away in German, only for one of the robbers to threaten to shoot them in German if they try it, which is part of the foreshadowing that said criminal is much more than just a bank robber.

The team is sympathetic until she begins whispering to the son in Romani, at which point she's dragged away. No one on the team speaks Romani (Prentiss only knows enough to recognize the language), but they were recording the interaction and quickly get a translation, which serves the same purpose. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter what language she used, the damage was done as soon as her son got the message: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Don't tell them about your brothers."</span>

A tourist pretends to be a foreigner who doesn't speak English so he doesn't have to have small talk conversations with others. Since he doesn't speak English, people have various conversations in front of him which eventually reveals a plot to drive the owner of the lodge out and use the place for KKK meetings.

Thus, she has no problem berating them in English and, at one point, mocking them by saying how she has no plan to actually help them get their mother from Hong Kong to America (which was the only reason they were helping her for). The brothers make it clear that they think she's an idiot, and end up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having no problem turning her in to the police at the end, with one of the brothers telling her in English "I speak better English than you speak Chinese!"</span>

Unimpressed, Vogel calmly replies (albeit in English) that Kazuo should care because Ultor is a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> that formally employs his son Shogo (who was in charge of the Ronin until Akuji took over in person).

<ul><li> There's an anecdote about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment">Haim Saban</a> that goes as such: During the '80s, Saban was attempting to buy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> Licensing rights, and was meeting with Gene Simmons with Avi Arad at his side. At a certain point in the meeting, Saban turns to Arad and says, in Hebrew, "Now we will gut him." Simmons responded by saying "You asshole, I'm one of you" in Hebrew and walking out of the meeting; his birth name is Chaim Witz, and he was born near Haifa in northern Israel.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.overheardeverywhere.com/archives/002438.html">One story on the website "Overheard Everywhere"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has an airport worker in Cologne refer to a pair of female Americans as sluts to one of his fellows — in German, of course.
<div class="indent"><strong>American guy:</strong> Could you stamp my passport, please? It's a hobby of mine. <br/><strong>Passport checker:</strong> <em>[to coworker, in German]</em> These damn Americans always want something. Look, they've all got booze and bags and T-shirts. Now they want stamps. <br/><strong>American girl:</strong> Sir, I'd like mine stamped, too. <br/><strong>Passport checker:</strong> <em>[in German]</em> I bet that girl was here to fuck guys. American girls become sluts in Europe. <br/><strong>American girl:</strong> Sir, that's not very nice! <br/><strong>Passport checker:</strong> <em>[still in German]</em> I hate it when they know German. Then we can't talk about them!
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> In short, if you assume someone <strong>visiting your country</strong> doesn't speak your language and you badmouth them, any consequences that arise are your own fault.
</dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2010/06/13/14372641.html">A woman reported a burglary to the police.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Partway in she got a phone call from her father and explained to him, in French, about how she and her boyfriend had set up the fake burglary plot. The investigating officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">spoke seven languages, including French.</a> What makes her actions even dumber is that this happened in Canada where even in an English-speaking province one should expect many people, especially police officers, to have some understanding of French. After all, it is the country's <em>second</em> official language.
</li><li> This happens often in bilingual regions of the US — California, Texas, the Southwest, etc. In Florida, one particularly foolish criminal used his "one phone call" to call his accomplices and tell them, in Creole, to dispose of the gun they had used. Sure enough, one of the detectives was herself of Haitian ancestry and understood everything he said. Much like the first example, his assuming that no one would understand him is especially stupid, as this took place in a predominantly Haitian community.
</li><li> In one <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fmylife.com/miscellaneous/329882">anecdote on FML<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the poster is a Swede in a non-Swedish community and tends to bad-mouth people in Swedish. When at a restaurant, they say a girl in the next booth is ugly. Said girl turns around and tells them to "Go to hell" in Swedish.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fmylife.com/article/today-i-was-with-my-grandma-waiting-in-a-line-she-only-speaks-chinese-and-there-was-a-black-man-in_161677.html">In another anecdote,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a lady was with her grandmother in a line as a black man talked loudly on his cell phone ahead of them. The grandma complained, in Chinese (her only language), that "the black man's really loud and annoying". After he hung up, he turned to the two and said, in perfect Chinese, "What's wrong with loud black men?"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> used a translator when talking with Churchill and Roosevelt. Stalin never let on to them that he knew English.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">George Takei</a> was a teenager, he earned some extra cash as a seasonal worker among mostly Mexican-Americans. The overseers were Japanese-Americans and one day he overheard them talking in Japanese about how they were going to cheat the workers out of some of their rightful pay. Cue young George telling them in the same language that if they did, he'd report them. They caved.
</li><li> In the end of the 19th century, a French banker visited a Russian factory he owned. There, he saw one man working with a wheelbarrow loaded with material for a blast furnace. He said (in French) "This monkey is working well". However, the worker was actually a nobleman who ran from his house, and knew French perfectly.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note576d2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note576d2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note576d2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">French was the preferred language of the Russian nobility.</span> So, he turned the wheelbarrow at him, and drove him halfway across the yard. When the banker had to climb an ore heap, the man stopped and said (in French!) "Sorry, the flooring here is too rough to control the wheelbarrow". The flooring was replaced.
</li><li> Happens a lot with deaf people. Say Alice indicates in some way that she is deaf. Bob and Carly, who see this, decide they can now make snide comments about her with impunity, because, well, she's deaf. She can't hear them, right? Unfortunately, Alice happens to be able to lip-read...
<ul><li> Something similar happened during a football game at Gallaudet University. The opposing team, Norfolk State, talked openly about their strategies, assuming that the Gallaudet team couldn't hear. Norfolk never guessed that they were great at reading lips, and were promptly slaughtered in the game.
</li><li> Or the other way around. During a chess match against a deaf team, some of the deaf players were using sign language to talk about their ongoing games, which is forbidden. Unfortunately, someone in the opposite team was responsible in his company for the troubles of deaf people and knew sign language (actually, he knows three sign languages, due to some employees also being foreign).
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretCho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretCho">Margaret Cho</a>. She was promoting her short-lived sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllAmericanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllAmericanGirl">All-American Girl</a></em>, about a Korean-American family, on a morning news show for a local TV station that was being bought out by Disney. The host asked her to tell the viewers at home "in [her] native language" that they're changing over to an ABC affiliate. But since she was born and raised in California and is not actually fluent in Korean, she looked at the camera and curtly said in plain English, "They're changing over to an ABC affiliate."
</li><li> English speakers are more likely to be the victim of this than speakers of other languages, since in most parts of the world there is a pretty good chance that the people around you will have at least some understanding of English. That said, it is pretty common knowledge that this is the case, so any English speakers who are humiliated in this way have only themselves to blame.
</li><li> This trope is becoming increasingly common in the USA with Spanish speakers as the percentage of the USA's population that knows Spanish increases.
</li><li> A Korean-American grocer tells her husband something negative about an African-American customer, with the addendum "he can't possibly know what we are talking about." The customer tells her, in fluent Korean, that he served in the Army in Korea in 1952.
</li><li> Disney encourages its cast members to become bilingual, in order to interact more smoothly with the guests. Unfortunately, the guests don't always realize that, and can be very, very abusive toward cast members they don't think can understand. There was one well-known incident where a cook making sandwiches to order listened very patiently as three French guests badmouthed the hotel they were staying in, the food the cook was making for them, and the cook himself while he made their meal. When he handed the sandwiches over, he said something along the lines of "I'm sorry your visit has been so difficult. If there is anything we can do to make it better, let us know." in flawless French. The guests left and apparently never returned to that restaurant for the rest of their stay.
</li><li> A very weird variation is the bilingual version of <em>O Canada</em>, ostensibly to please both French- and English-speaking Canadians. It might have worked if one stanza was in one language and one in the other. Unfortunately, the switch occurs mid-stanza, making part of the song sheer gibberish for those that only speak either English or French (it's common for crowds in Western Canada to sing the English part, and go silent at the French, due to most of them not speaking that language). The Bilingual Backfire? Those that speak <em>both</em> know that the two versions say completely different things, resulting in Phrase Salad.
</li><li> Parents in Israel — or, for that matter, any non-Anglophone country — often switch to English so their kid wont understand when they talk about him. It can get awkward if the kid already knows more English than they think or has an English-speaking friend over; parents are often aware of the new limitation, but might slip up.
</li><li> Welsh regiments of the British Army often used Welsh in their communications, thinking that the obscurity of the language would keep it secure. This generally worked, but apparently backfired on the guardsmen on some occasions during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> as Welsh was surprisingly widely studied in Nazi circles, since it was considered an example of early Aryan languages.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6otl9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6otl9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6otl9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was still used in the Far East for comms, as the chances of there being Welsh-speaking Japanese was held to be vanishingly small.</span>. Later during the Falklands War, the British Army decided against using Welsh in their communications to prevent this trope from occurring not because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgentinaIsNaziLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgentinaIsNaziLand">Argentina Is Nazi Land</a>, but because Argentina has a well-established Welsh-speaking community in Patagonia who could probably have exploited this trope. Welsh soldiers serving in Northern Ireland also had to be reminded that the two major local universities, as well as the principal ones in the Republic, all had Celtic Studies departments where Welsh was taught to students. Therefore the chances of there being Republicans listening in to radio comms and being able to understand every word was very high indeed.
</li><li> When someone who speaks a less spoken language visits another country they're often quick to assume that nobody understands a word they're saying, completely forgetting that they're not the only ones who travel or that people move to different countries. Chances are that someone is wondering what the better option is: Reveal to them that they are understood or continue having fun. The owner of the weblog Roachware occasionally tells friends an episode when he (a German) went to Belgium to a town on the Flemish/Walloon language divide and looked for a specific address. He asked a passer-by, in Flemish (which is close enough to Dutch for him to speak fluently), only to receive a "Comprend pas" (I don't understand). As he was German, he probably surprised the other person enough that, when he then switched to French "Pouvez-vous me dire...", he was interrupted by clear directions. He didn't even say the name of the street in French — which, due to Flemish/Walloon idiosyncrasies was quite different from the Flemish name....
</li><li> Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes">Auto-translate features</a>, this can easily happen with social media posts made in another languages (although in general it is pretty stupid to post something on the internet you don't want other people to read, no matter the language).
</li><li> Virtual Gaming allows people from all over the world to play online games together. Occasionally people end up in a foreign server and figure that they can say whatever they want about the foreigners. They can then be caught with their pants around their legs when one of the foreigners reveals that he or she understands their language.
</li><li> This happened on a regular basis at the Canadian Military College at St-Jean-sur-Richelieu when sports teams from French colleges elsewhere in Québec competed against them and first-time players would hear cadet athletes, coaches, or spectators conversing in English, especially those with the distinctive Newfoundland accent and would start saying something insulting in French. They tended to learn very quickly that everyone who went there, if they weren't already, was required to become at least functionally bilingual.
</li><li> The Irish army, when trying to avoid being overheard in Lebanon in the '80s, spoke in Irish (e.g. when radio communications, etc), reasoning that no one outside Ireland spoke the language. However, they eventually discovered that some of Israelis had learned Irish.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7whce');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7whce" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7whce');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It shouldn't have surprised them; the President of Israel at the time, Chaim Herzog, was an Irish Jew born in Belfast and raised in Dublin, and Ireland has a small-but-vital Jewish population, most of whom would have been taught basic Gaelic in school and many of whom would have dual Israeli nationality, or at least visit frequently</span> Given that even most Irish people don't speak Irish fluently, the speech is slow and deliberate, making the translation an easy job. They switched to speaking English with very thick Irish accents, much harder for non-Irish people to understand!
