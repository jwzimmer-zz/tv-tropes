<p>Let's say you're watching a movie, playing a game, or reading a book. The story is well-told, the characters are engaging, and the settings are beautifully presented. When you finish, you walk away satisfied with what it had to offer.
</p><p>Later, you decide you're in the mood to experience it again. Maybe you'd like to remember the exact way a quote was phrased, maybe you want to show it to a friend, or maybe it's just for personal enjoyment.

</p><p>Congratulations, you've discovered that this work has a Rewatch Bonus! Turns out the creators put a lot more work into writing the story than you realized. While there were bigger things drawing your attention when you were first experiencing the story, now that you're revisiting it, you can now see that there was a lot of interesting setup to said bigger things. This trope also isn't limited to narrative elements and can also refer to quick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">blink-and-you'll-miss-it</a> sight gags, interesting character quirks, and other things that you didn't notice or were unable to appreciate on the first go-around.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> has <em>plenty</em>. With the massive amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Foreshadowing/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Foreshadowing/AttackOnTitan">foreshadowing</a> and revelations, many things soon come together and make sense on a second watch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>:
<ul><li> The anime was originally broadcast in non-chronological order, the plot naturally made more sense when re-watched chronologically, or at least with the knowledge of what order the episodes take place in.
</li><li> The anime also has many hidden details one might miss during the first viewing. Just as an example, did you know the taxi driver of episode 5 (chronologically) is very likely to be the butler Arakawa?
</li></ul></li><li> The first time you watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em>, you're just trying to figure what is going on. See it again, and you'll be noticing little jokes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a>, and visual metaphors you missed the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Homura's</a> pained expression when Madoka meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteIsEvil">Kyubey</a> for the first time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">Well, it's not really the first time</a>.</span> The creators even encouraged the audience to re-watch the series from the beginning after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Episode 10</span> was aired, saying it would change people's perception of Homura.
</li><li> The runes weren't meant to be deciphered until the release of the last BD, where the jacket would have the same lines as the almost-last display of runes, in plain letters (a case of Rosetta stone, that is). Unfortunately for the creators, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageBoards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageBoards">some people</a> are determined code-breakers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Mami mogu mogu</a>.</span>
</li><li> Also true for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion</a></em>, perhaps even more so. For example, the park scene initially seems nice, but unimportant. The second time, its eerie undertones come to the forefront, and one realizes that the conversation in it prompts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Homura</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.
</li><li> After watching <em>Rebellion</em>, consider what we have learned about Nagisa Momoe's wish. Now go back and watch the conversation Mami and Madoka have in episode 3 inside Charlotte's Labyrinth. Yeah.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: It's got foreshadowing galore, Easter eggs here and there, and trivial lines that will blow up in your face 500 chapters later. And it all just makes perfect sense and shapes the <em>One Piece</em> world and its characters beyond the first glance. The fandom jokes that Eiichiro Oda has the memory of an elephant. You know that one minor character who's seen in one chapter and then forgotten? He'll be back, 400 chapters later, and often in a <em>big</em> way.
</li><li> Watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon">RahXephon</a></em> a second time is a <em>completely</em> different experience, as suddenly all sorts of really minor incidents suddenly seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">symbolism.</a> More than a few people have claimed to not truly understand the story until rewatching the series.
</li><li> Pretty much everything in episode 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> where Okabe and Mayuri visit the time travel lecture counts as foreshadowing and gains more significance in episode 23 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Okabe revisits the conference using the improved time machine.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Itachi had set up Sasuke's eyes such that it would cast Amaterasu on Tobi if Tobi were to show his Sharingan to Sasuke. He does, and the Amaterasu does engulf Tobi. Tobi goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">offscreen</a> for a while, and returns without any damage, exclaiming to himself, "I am glad Itachi did not know everything about me." We can now see that Tobi escaped the Amaterasu by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using Kamui to teleport it into his alternate dimension.</span>
</li><li> Once you know Tobi's <em>true</em> true identity, it is <em>embarrassingly</em> obvious that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Tobi" is a phonetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Sdrawkcab Name</a> for Obito.</span> Though, to be completely honest, it was obvious before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> which is why so many dismissed the initial theory at first. Truthfully, a person could fill an entire page on just Tobi alone, listing all the little details that doubled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> for his true identity in hindsight.
</li></ul></li><li> Rewatching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> is very helpful due to the symbolism-heavy nature of the series. On rewatch, the viewers know about the truth of the duels and the Rose Bride, allowing the watcher to pick up on certain characters' behaviors and actions and notice a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing they might not have noticed before.
</li><li> A relatively minor scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> becomes very significant when one has finished the first series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Novelist Takatsuki Sen can pass through the CCG's ghoul-detecting gates because she, like the protagonist, is a half-ghoul...the monstrously powerful One-Eyed Owl.</span>
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> gives away the endings of every story arc in the show, and you'll have no idea what any of it means until you watch the whole thing through and start over.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SeitokaiYakuindomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SeitokaiYakuindomo">Seitokai Yakuindomo</a></em>, Mitsuba mentions how she noticed a "lens-like" gleam in the sky appear from time to time (this is after she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">destroys it by chucking a rock at it</a>). Rewatching the episode again, yup, there it is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinFamilyAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinFamilyAllStars">Lupin Family All-Stars</a></em> is completely different the second time around. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Everyone's dialogue and demeanor make a lot more sense when you know they're all another character in disguise.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, when Zeref meets Natsu for the first time onscreen, he <em>cries</em> and says, "I missed you, Natsu." This appears weird, not only to the audience but also to the in-universe characters. Happy even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it saying, "You have some real weirdos as friends, Natsu!" Watching this scene again after knowing the backstory presented in a much later arc makes Zeref's reaction understandable since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Natsu is Zeref's brother, whom he loved very much.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em>:
<ul><li> Biscoe and Norton play a major role near the end, to the point that their appearance seems too sudden, except for Biscoe, who has a brief scene in episode 15. But then, in a rewatch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Biscoe and Norton actually first appear in episode 6 as nameless characters in a blink-and-you-miss-it shot of Big Daddy's conference.</a>
</li><li> Alzac Tino, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whom Big Daddy later chooses to lead Millennion after his retirement.</span> Alzac first appears in the same shot as Biscoe and Norton.
</li><li> The piano tune in episode 6 is a variant of the OST Bitter Ending that plays more often in the latter part of the anime as everything slowly goes to hell. The tune plays as Brandon dances with Maria, as Big Daddy has a conference with his business associates, and as Harry eliminates the Lightning goons, which drops a hint that the happy times won't last long. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Much later in the series, Brandon breaks up with Maria, Harry murders Brandon and Big Daddy and has Maria killed, and Millennion becomes a corrupt organization under Harry's reign.</span>
</li><li> Mika's family speech at the finale makes more sense (and is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal">Bodyguard Betrayal</a> has just happened to her and she isn't aware of it</span>) if one pays more attention to Gary's and Widge's speech in episode 21. Gary and Widge define family as a special bond that exists between people as long as they don't betray each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em>: Episode 10, particularly the post-credits puts everything in perspective: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The episode reveals a year prior to Victor going to Japan, he and Yuri had already met when Yuri got drunk and partied, including inviting Yurio, Victor and Christophe for a dance-off. The end result of that partying was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that Yuri was the one that invited Victor to go to Japan and be his coach, and it's also implied that Victor started falling in love with Yuri then, which would explain all the times he acted flirty or touchy-feely with him.</span>

During the flashback to what Ed saw when he saw the Truth, there are flashes of real-world pictures, such as the American flag. Later on, one soldier is heard humming a real-world song. And later, we see an abandoned chapel with many broken stained-glass windows, and inside there are clearly crosses on the altar. And then when it goes into blatant foreshadowing, Izumi notes that a letter Hohenheim wrote to Dante was dated 400 years ago with a dating system based off the birth of Christ, a religion that hasn't been practiced in centuries in Amestris, showing us that Amestris is an alternate history of our world.</span>

Rewatching the beginning reveals that not only did she attend the same show as Akko, but she's also the very first character onscreen.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017">the series itself</a>, Croix's existence and relevance to the plot is hinted at a couple of times before she makes her official introduction halfway through:

This is the show that we learn Chariot used the Dream Fuel Spirit for, the one that Croix had been helping her out with, and the one that ultimately marked the end of their friendship.</span>
</li><li> Her voice is heard in the flashback Akko sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the Polaris fountain, as the one Chariot is performing her Moonlit Witch routine for, indicating just how close the two friends used to be before their falling out.</span>

Sorry, I'm late. I've been looking everywhere for you." However later in the movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sophie travels back in time and meets a young Howl, telling him to find her in the future,</span> his first words to Sophie taking on a different, more heartwarming meaning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>: The anime is famous about this.
<ul><li> Just to start with, there are three characters in a chat room who discuss how the general public sees the events of each episode. Their identities are revealed in episode 12, and in hindsight, are super obvious.
</li><li> Mikado always gets a very interesting look on his face whenever anyone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mentions the Dollars. This is because he founded the gang as a joke over the internet, so he's shocked that it's become a serious power in the city.</span>
</li><li> Anri tends to shut down whenever anyone tries to hit on her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet">which is often</a>), and shows a shocking amount of stamina when she drags Mikado halfway across the city without even breathing hard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not only does she have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove">little understanding of love,</a> but she's bonded to the demonic blade Saika, who taught her swordsmanship and can provide her with supernatural endurance in an emergency.</span>
</li><li> Masaomi starts the series (after a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoUnfunnyItsFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoUnfunnyItsFunny">terrible jokes</a>) by giving Mikado a serious rundown of local politics and telling him who to avoid. He also glares whenever he sees the Yellow Scarves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He actually founded the Yellow Scarves in middle school, and with Izaya's help was able to weave through the politics of the city to make them the strongest gang in the area.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Shimoneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Shimoneta">Shimoneta</a></em>: The sudden awakening of Anna's hormones is commonly attributed to the accidental kiss between her and Tanukichi. Rewatching the scene reveals it wasn't the kiss alone that did it, it was caused by his knee brushing against her lower genitals as he stood up. The contact causes Anna's thigh to twitch in response. After Tanukichi runs away, Anna is seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">lightly rubbing herself</a> in the same spot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor">though it's obscured</a> by the folds of her dress.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">Gundam Build Divers</a></em>, Ayame has two vocal-only flashbacks and gives Riku a warning about the fact that she pilots an SD Gundam when he attempts to recruit her into Build Divers. These make more sense after watching episode 11.
</li><li> Minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>: there are a couple of scenes in Episode 29 of the anime, where Seiya and Saori share <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">rather some romantic moments</a>: first when she holds onto his neck before they jump off the cliff to escape, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">while he's unconscious and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss">she almost kisses him</a>. If you pay attention, Shaina's attitude during both scenes takes a different undertone if you already know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that she's actually in love with Seiya due to one time they met during training.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets">The Quintessential Quintuplets</a></em>: If you go back and re-read the manga after reading from Chapter 86 and onward, you'll notice that <em>many</em> events involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yotsuba</span> have become this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series as a whole thrives on this, with lots of little details, forshadowing, and character traits only becoming noticeable on a second or third rereading.
</li><li> One particularly strong example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Chapter 192</a>, which paints all of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Osaragi's</span> previous appearances in a very different light <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">given that she was revealed to have been in love with Ishigami since middle school.</span>

</li><li> Quite a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> due to the large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhovs Guns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Gunmen</a> seeded throughout the story's earlier points.

</li><li> There's also all the subtle build-up to Spider-Man's eventual battles with the Roxxon Corporation. On reread, you'll notice more than <em>a lot</em> of Spidey's enemies and problems were being caused by Roxxon indirectly even before he knew about them; Beetle being hired by them, Killer Shrike attacking their labs, Spot and Sandman being experimented on by them...

The first part of the story is Lyra noticing how many of the objects used by ponies were not designed for hooves in mind and coming to the conclusion that humans must have been in Equestria.

</li><li> The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Héctor is a father</span> becomes more apparent in second viewings, with the way he speaks with Miguel to calm him down, censors naughty songs and overall assists and encourages Miguel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>:
<ul><li> Seemingly innocent lines from Prince Hans can be re-interpreted as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disguising his true nature in later viewings.</span> For example, during his duet with Anna, some of his lines ("We finish each other's-" "Sandwiches!" "That's what <em>I</em> was gonna say!") are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suddenly signs of tailoring himself to make Anna fall for him.</span> In particular, in the same duet, he has a line about having waited his whole life to "find my own place". While he says this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he isn't looking at Anna - he's turned away from her to gesture at her kingdom.</span> On one's first viewing, it's difficult to notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's essentially admitting to being more interested in the kingdom than the girl here,</span> but it's glaringly obvious on a rewatch.
<ul><li> Elsa even says to Anna following said duet: "You can't marry a man you just met." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Becomes important as she knows Hans is not who he seems.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Observant viewers will notice that during the scene where Hans "saves" Elsa from being shot by a crossbow bolt, which brings an enormous chandelier down on her, that he both glances up to make note that the chandelier is above Elsa, <em>and</em> has completely wrested control of the crossbow from its owner when the arrow is fired.
</li><li> Similarly, the lyrics of the opening song foreshadow a lot of the later events of the film; Elsa's powers and her developmental stages, the freezing of the harbor, the frozen heart, and the importance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">true love</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie">The LEGO Movie</a></em> is absolutely loaded with these. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Once you realize that the story is - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">probably</a> - just taking place in a child's imagination, all those hints at the deliberate artificiality of the LEGO world</span> - the fact that almost all sound effects (a plane taking off, the pigs oinking, laser blasts) are provided by human voices, the deliberately limited movements of the minifigures, the presence of physical objects like Vitruvius' lollipop staff and the Kragle - that much more significant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em>: The "Lilo feeding her pet fish a sandwich because she thinks he can control the weather" bit at first seems like little more than a silly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>. Once you learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was raining the day her parents died in a car crash</span>, it becomes a lot sadder.
<ul><li> Not only that but on rewatching, pay close attention to the weather when Pudge gets his sandwich. The clouds which were gathering in the background disperse. <em>Lilo may be right.</em>

<ul><li> At the science fair, Wilbur knocks over a girl's box of frogs and she makes him pick them all up. Wilbur isn't too pleased, calls the girl "annoying" and isn't amused when she warns him that she "knows karate". The scene is already funny but it becomes even more hilarious when you realize <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the little girl is Franny, Wilbur's future mother and yes, she does know karate.</span>
</li><li> When meeting and introducing the Robinsons, Bud casually mentions to Lewis that he would like Wilbur's mother Franny. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Franny is actually Cornelius/Lewis's wife.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>, the scene where Sulley accidentally scares Boo has Mike in the background convincing Mr. Waternoose that Boo isn't toxic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His reactions during that scene are all off, and indicative of his role in the plot to kidnap human children. They include a cartoonish gasp and pantomime raising of hands when he first sees her (instead of the terror displayed by <em>every other monster</em> at the prospect of a human child being loose), a calculating shiftiness in his eyes once Mike starts talking, being so willing to discard a lifetime of teaching during the course of a minute-long speech from Mike that he willingly picks Boo up (which Mike is still hesitant to do after a full day in her company), a different sort of anger during his "how could this happen?" question than would be expected from someone who's just been told a murderous psychopath is using his factory to kidnap human children, and then immediately asking who else knows about Boo once Mike finishes. Assuming the viewer wasn't distracted by the heartbreaking way Boo cowers away from Sulley, it would be implausible for even the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> to react as calmly as Waternoose does to a massive security breach from a "incredibly dangerous" human child.

</li><li> The opening musical number "This is Halloween" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em> can seem even more impressive when you watch it the second time, and you realize that the inanimate pumpkin-headed scarecrow in the very first shot is the hero Jack Skellington; it first seems to be a simple establishing shot to set the mood of the film, until the scarecrow reappears and springs to life towards the end of the song, revealed to be a disguised Jack in a pumpkin mask. Relatedly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">main villain</a> Oogie Boogie can seem even scarier when you realize that he's also introduced in an anonymous cameo during the opening, as "the Shadow on the Moon at Night".
<ul><li> Not just them; <em>everyone</em> in the opening number ends up as a recurring character for the rest of the movie.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>:
<ul><li> Woody and Buzz mistake the mutant toys they encounter at Sids house to be cannibals at first. Indeed, on a first viewing it appears that the toys really are as bad as Woody and Buzz believe them to be, before theyre revealed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actually be good</span>. For example, when Woody first encounters them, they are seen carrying away the bodies of two toys Sid wrecked; then they are shown blocking the door to Sids room when Woody and Buzz try to escape. But when you rewatch those scenes with the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mutant toys really are not evil in mind, it becomes apparent that they were just carrying away the broken toys so Sid wouldnt cause more harm to them, and when they blocked the doorway they were really just trying to protect Woody and Buzz from Sids dog Scud, who was right outside. Also note that they are never shown attempting to attack Woody or Buzz.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> movies have something from an <em>upcoming</em> movie worked in, doubling as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing">Production Foreshadowing</a>. It'd take the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> to recognize Nemo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">Finding Nemo</a></em> as the toy fish Boo handed to Sulley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>, but you'll definitely notice these things on your next viewing of the earlier film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Once you know who's actually behind it all and why, certain early events that seemed innocent on first viewing take on a more sinister cast. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The way Bellwether happens by at <em>just the right time</em> to force Chief Bogo into putting Judy on the Otterton case no longer seems quite so coincidental in retrospect  and her excusing herself from her office as Judy and Nick look through the traffic cameras no longer seems unintentional.</span>
<ul><li> A big blink-and-you-miss occurs when Bellwether answers the phone for Lionheart: At the bottom of the phone is a stickynote with the phone number of someone named "Doug". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doug is the name of the scientist making the night howler serum causing the animals to go savage, and she's in on it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> At the beginning of the movie, Judy chases down a thief, who has stolen bulbs from a florist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Why would a thief steal bulbs from a florist? Later, Judy identifies them as Night Howler bulbs (though she uses the scientific name for them) when talking to Chief Bogo about the crime, then we learn that Otterton is a florist, laying a firm foundation for a flower to be an important part of the case.</span>
</li><li> It is more apparent when Nick/Judy are able to come up with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As Nick says "we'll think of something," he is looking down at the blueberries spilled on the floor and his face clearly shows an idea forming before being interrupted by Bellwether, who then proceeds to gloat for a while giving them time to set up their plan.</span>
</li><li> Doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>, there's a very brief shot of Nick and Judy reacting to what they're hearing when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the unnamed badger doctor explains to Lionheart her theory about the savage incidents having to do with the predators' biology.</span> If you pay close attention to their faces, you can see that Judy starts listening intently like she thinks that makes a lot of sense and explains everything, while Nick looks shocked and offended that such a thing would be suggested. This very subtly foreshadows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how Nick becomes terribly upset when Judy repeats the theory at the press conference</span>.
</li><li> As the subway car that Nick and Judy have commandeered tips over from taking the curve too fast, a brief cut inside the car shows Nick falling to the side and a split second later, the briefcase holding the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nighthowler serum and airgun</span> falls right into Nick's stomach giving him the opportunity to save it from the crash. Watching the remainder of the crash scene shows how the animators cleverly position Nick to shield the briefcase from the audience's view until the final reveal.
</li><li> When Nick is confronting Judy about her comments during the press conference, he asks if she's afraid of him  her nose twitches in the same manner as her childhood confrontation with Gideon, giving a subtle hint that the answer is "Yes".
</li><li> When Nick is giving his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speech to Chief Bogo, he says that they have 10 hours left. If you watch Judy's face when he says this, she is visibly concentrating, then frowns, indicating that she finds this statement incorrect, but then dismisses it with a subtle shake of her head.
</li><li> When Nick is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hit by a night howler pellet by Bellwether</span> and Judy is being cornered, there are two blink-and-you-miss moments that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're actually pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>. First, Judy's nose is not twitching, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic">Character Tic</a> for whenever she's scared or suspicious. Second, Nick's eyes look normal instead of slitted or dilated, and the remains of the pellet can be seen on his neck when it should absorb into the skin like it did with Otterton and Manchas. These are what clue the viewer that they're only acting despite the realism.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Megamind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Megamind">Megamind</a></em> has a <em>terrific</em> blink-and-you'll-miss-it minor detail you likely won't even notice the first time, but will definitely only make sense during your second watch. When Metro Man and Megamind are bantering after he's been trapped in the abandoned observatory, the screen the hero's face is on skips a single frame after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> fails to fire. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When it's revealed he actually used his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> to fake his death, that "frame skip" was actually him being gone and setting it all up in a fraction of a second</span>.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Many European arthouse films are made to be seen multiple times to really get what they are about. This is especially the case for the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanLucGodard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanLucGodard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>What you see with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanLucGodard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanLucGodard">Godard</a>...is that ten years later, after the movie, you see that he was telling the story. But because of his modern mise-en-scène, the story wasnt exposed. It appears over time. And in that way, hes like Picasso or Einstein. Because hes searching, hes searching and he finds...People walk out of Godard movies because they say theres no story, theres no logic. But there is a story. Its just exposed differently. For instance, in a classic film, youll have an actor who says, Im the President of the United States. In a Godard film, youll have an actor saying nothing, and youll have a voice coming in from somewhere saying, Mr. President, do you want a glass of water? Thats his method of exposition. Its hard to understand. And you need to understand that logic to be moved by the movie. But with time and maybe one sentence in the program, these movies can touch people. Slowly were catching up.</em>

<ul><li> In an early scene, Stuart is told that there's been a sudden change to their "Beta Squad." When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> McClane talks to a member of Grant's team, he explains he's a last minute replacement for a team member who got sick.</span>

</li><li> An early scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrandBudapestHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrandBudapestHotel">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a></em> has the Writer speaking to the camera for a while until he suddenly breaks off to yell at his son, who is revealed to be aiming a toy gun at him. On a rewatch, you can see the Writer's expression very subtly change a few moments before he breaks off, presumably when the kid entered the room with the gun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AHistoryOfViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AHistoryOfViolence">A History of Violence</a></em>, a small town diner owner named Tom saves his restaurant, patrons, and employees from a pair of murderous thieves. After Tom's actions hit the news, a group of gangsters from Philadelphia come to town, saying that Tom is actually named Joey Cusack, that he was also a gangster from Philadelphia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob">The Irish Mob</a>, and was the sort of criminal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror">scared even the other hardcore criminals</a>. For the first two thirds or so of the film, the audience is being teased with the question of whether Tom really is Joey. After watching for the first time and learning that Tom and Joey really are the same person, (even if there's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</a> thing going on) nearly every action, ambiguous expression, or choice made by Tom is open to being reinterpreted, and tiny details or camera shots that last for just a few seconds become clues to the truth.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> has you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwed</a> the first time, heavily confused the second time because you start looking for signs of dream and reality, and finally by the third time, you might get it.

<ul><li> Colonel Brighton, who had a complicated relationship with Lawrence not quite being able to explain the nature of that relationship.
</li><li> Allenby, the man who twice convinced Lawrence to not only go back but want to, when Lawrence had been ready to quit, saying he "didn't know him well, you know". No one knew Lawrence better than Allenby.
</li><li> It's not hard to figure out what Jackson Bentley is likely picturing when he calls Lawrence a shameless exhibitionist.
</li><li> And, finally, knowing that the unnamed man who calls Bentley out for his offhand comment a. slapped Lawrence (dressed as an Arab) in the face and never realized who it was, and b. specifically approached Lawrence for the handshake he brags about in this scene just because he wanted to be able to brag.

Abe is perturbed and weirdly insistent that Joe should go to China instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thats because Abe, being from the future, knows Joe is supposed to retire to China since thats where hes retrieved from when his loop is closed. He thinks the future has been altered and is trying to nudge it back on track by telling Joe to go to China.</span>
</li><li> The Rainmakers henchmen in the future scenes are wearing distinctive black costumes with wide-brimmed cowboy hats. Later in the movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cid</span> is shown to have posters, drawings, and toys depicting a superhero who wears <em>that exact outfit</em>. Hes the Rainmakers younger self and got the idea for the costumes from that superhero.

Even their accents are slightly different, especially when angry or drunk (when the façade is weakest).

<ul><li> Watching it again you can pick up how the supporting characters behave around Teddy Daniels knowing he's actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a delusional patient at Shutter Island and not a marshal investigating a disappearance.</span>
</li><li> When first arriving on the film, there is a gag where Teddy's partner Chuck has great difficulty getting his gun out of the holster, eventually taking the entire holster off, to Teddy's confusion and the Deputy Warden's annoyance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">On second viewings it's clear that Chuck can't get it out because he's a Doctor on the island, not a lawman, which is also why the Deputy Warden acts like this is annoying, but doesn't see it as unexpected</span>.
</li><li> Late in the film, when Teddy believes there is a conspiracy happening on the island, the Warden gives Teddy a lift back to the main buildings on the island. During the lift, the Warden gives a very odd speech about violence, and how it's God's gift. It makes it seem as though the Warden isn't quite right in the head, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but he's actually just taunting Teddy because Teddy's is a dangerous patient on the island who the Warden thinks should be lobotimized</span>. More specifically, the Warden's line "I know you - we've known each other for centuries" sounds like a metaphor, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the first part, at least is true. The Warden's known Teddy for two years</span>. The most blatant line, however, is "Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be controlled, but I know different". Teddy interprets this as Cawley believing Teddy can't truly interfere with the conspiracy on the island. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Warden is actually referring to Cawley's belief that he can cure Teddy</span>.

Regarding the identity of "Brett", you can catch a few early clues, with one friend calling him "Pack Man" (although most will audibly interpret it as "Pac-Man" the first time before they know The Reveal) and Mary also talking about how he lived "up north". Also, Dom mentioning Ted's zipper incident  even though he wasn't there and Ted never told him about it  is a big tip-off about his hidden agenda that's usually regarded as a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the first time.

Only after you read through all of them will you pick up on scenes and lines you passed over before and realise how significant they really were. For example, the bats' prophecy in the first book, <em>The Dark Portal</em>, will become clear upon reading the main trilogy in its entirety. According to the author:
<div class="indent">"Before I even began writing the first chapter, however, I worked out the storylines for all three books. This meant that I knew precisely who was going to survive and who was not! It also enabled me to put in hints of what could happen later."

<ul><li> Several of the novels contain revelations that, once learned, make it worthwhile to go back and re-read not only those individual books but <em>the entire previous series</em> to catch all the newfound implications. Most notably, re-reads can get <em>really</em> interesting once you know that (MAJOR spoilers) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thomas is Harry's half-brother, Ebenezar is their grandfather, Susan gets pregnant from the love scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathMasks">Death Masks</a></em>, Bob has a hidden evil side, Martin and Peabody are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">moles</a>, Maeve is infected with Nemesis, and the Winter Court protects the known universe from Outsiders.</span>

When you read the book with the knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amy is completely insane</span>, this scene really hits you hard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> One example is Sirius Black being mentioned in passing in the first chapter of the first book when he wouldn't be introduced until the third.

</li><li> It's quite funny to read through the books and see how wrong the main characters get everything. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Like when Harry hears Snape's and Quirrell's conversation in the Forbidden Forest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em></span>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Dumbledore</strong>: Keep an eye on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Quirrell</span>, won't you?
</div></li><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Snape's muttering the countercurse while Quirrell hexes Harry's broom makes way more sense after book 7, when you learn that Snape is still protecting Harry out of his love for Lily, Harry's dead mother.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> It is first mentioned off-hand that Nick got Peeves to drop the Vanishing Cabinet and break it, in order to distract Filch from Harry. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">the second book</a>, Harry hides in a cabinet in Borgin and Burkes' to avoid meeting Malfoy and his father. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">book five</a>, Fred and George say they shoved one of the Slytherins into the broken Vanishing Cabinet. Well, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfbloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfbloodPrince">book six</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vanishing Cabinet plays a <em>huge</em> role. Malfoy realized that the two vanishing cabinets form a passage between each other, he's been spending a lot of time in the Room of Requirement to fix it <em>and</em> it's also how Death Eaters got into Hogwarts at the end of the book, despite the stricter safety measures</span>!
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">book four</a>, very early scenes make a lot more sense upon re-read. In particular, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Winky sitting in the Top Box, her fleeing from the campsite, exactly how far ahead Fake!Moody planned by giving the water plant book to Neville after their first lesson, his overall help to Harry during the tournament and Voldemort's speech of the faithful Death Eater residing in Hogwarts. Also, Moody's surprise when getting a look at the Marauder's Map, and him confiscating the map from Harry, makes much more sense when the reader discovers Moody's true identity. The map nearly ruined Fake Moody's whole plan and <em>would</em> have ruined his plan at that very moment if Harry had gotten a look at it</span>.
</li><li> In book one, Harry gets the feeling that Snape can read his mind. In book five, Dumbledore assigns Snape to teach him how to <em>stop</em> people from, basically, reading his mind, being very good at both reading minds and preventing his mind from being read.
</li><li> Early in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">book five</a>, Petunia reveals she knows what dementors are because she heard "that horrible boy" tell Lily. Harry and first-time readers assume she's talking about Harry's father, James. Re-readers might recognize that she actually meant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snape.</span>
</li><li> Snape's mutual hatred of Sirius seems to be solely based on Sirius bullying Snape in their teens, hence a lot of characters wondering why he can't simply let it go. Re-read book 3 with the knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everything Snape did was in revenge for Lily's death since everyone thought it was Sirius who betrayed the Potters. Even if Snape learned Pettigrew was the traitor, it was still Sirius' idea to make Pettigrew the Secret Keeper, and in a way his fault they were murdered.</span>
</li><li> In the first book, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> Neville Longbottom gets into a fight with Crabbe and Goyle to keep them from ganging up on Ron (who is fighting Draco). Ron mentions that Neville is in the hospital wing, but has no serious injuries himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This was the first indication that Neville, meek as he was, was placed in Gryffindor for <em>good reason</em> and his future role as a protector of others, but the first time you read it, it just seems like another joke at Neville's expense.</span>
<ul><li> One of the reasons why Neville joined the fight in the first place is because Malfoy made a rude ableist crack about the mental ward in St. Mungo's. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that his parents are permanent residents there because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">they were tortured into insanity by the Death Eaters</a> puts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Neville's reaction</a> to what Malfoy said in a whole new (and heartbreaking) light</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In something of a montage sequence in Book 5, it is offhandedly mentioned that the characters find, among other junk, "a heavy locket none of them could open". Re-reading after learning about the Horcruxes in Books 6 &amp; 7 cause the reader to realize that they had a Horcrux in their possession the whole time.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">book 6</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore's</span> final words are heartbreaking in two very different ways. On the first reading, you believe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that Dumbledore, shocked by Snape's betrayal, is begging him not to kill him.</span> However, on the second reading, you realize it's actually the exact opposite, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dumbledore is begging Snape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKillArrangement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKillArrangement">to go through with their agreement to kill him</a>, so as to gain Voldemort's trust.</span> In addition, the look of "hatred and revulsion" on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snape's</span> face, seemingly directed at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore</span>, is actually directed at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">himself</span>.
<ul><li> Related to the above, Hagrid tells Harry that he accidentally overheard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore and Snape</span> having an argument, and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snape</span> sounded particularly angry and suggested that he might have "changed his mind".

The other kids even ask why Constance was selected to join the group, seeing how the other children are all gifted, and Constance doesn't seem particularly smart. Only at the end of the book do you realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she isn't a dwarf at all, she's a very intelligent toddler</span>. When reading the book for a second time, you'll notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although there are many references to Constance being short, at no point does anybody use the words 'dwarf' or 'midget'.</span> There are many other small touches that set up the twist.

For starters, Audrina flashes back to the First Audrina staggering home after the rape, which would be impossible if she'd been killed. Later, when she has another flashback about the rape, she recalls her boyfriend/husband Arden being there, also impossible if the First Audrina was nine years older than she was.
</li><li> Pretty much all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirNabokov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirNabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>'s books have this, on account of his belief that the first time a reader reads any book they're just coming to grips with it, and you only really get to know a book on successive readings: the way he put it was "We do not read books: we re-read them." He actually built hidden spoilers into his work, for the benefit of people re-reading them. The first time you read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita">Lolita</a></em>, you're informed in the fictional 'foreword' that "Mrs. Richard F.

Going back through the previous books, it becomes so clear that Harvey was only mad at Tommy being able to dance with Sara because he was jealous, and why he's also been nicer to Sara than anyone else.

Sure, the main plot is much easier to follow than a lot of other highly elaborate fantasy epics, but you can only really appreciate the rich backstory of Westeros and its families by rereading the books several times over. Other bonuses include all of the visions experienced by Bran Stark in his dreams or by Dany in the House of the Undying (which foreshadow heavily a lot of what happens in the series), as well as the seeds of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roose Bolton's betrayal of the Starks.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em> is very satisfying to re-read, as you connect the prophetic epigraphs to the actual events from the books. It gains an additional bonus once you read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Edgedancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Edgedancer">Edgedancer</a></em> and learn that there's a species which can use cremlings  tiny animals that are as popular on Roshar as sparrows are here on Earth  to spy on people.

</li><li> If you reread <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, you notice all sorts of foreshadowing that you'd have missed the first time, especially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsTheOriginalSeries">the original series</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsPowerOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsPowerOfThree">Power of Three</a></em>.

</li><li> Steris at the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne">Wax and Wayne</a></em> is as the only noblewoman in the city whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Wax</a> hasn't offended, and is his last hope for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney">marriage that will save his house</a>. She appears to be a stuffy, domineering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, but she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a> upon later reads. Most of her off-putting behavior in her first appearances isn't because of malice, but because she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> and tends to overcompensate.
<ul><li> Within moments of meeting each other, Steris makes it clear to Wax that this is a marriage between houses and not each other, going as far to neatly schedule future interactions in the marriage contract, leaving little time for them to get to know each other in private. Seems like she already dislikes Wax? Shes afraid that <em>he'll</em> dislike <em>her</em> once he gets to know her, just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">her previous fiances</a>.
</li><li> When Wax wonders why she schedules all their public appearances, she says moving too quickly would be scandalous, and while she doesn't make or like the rules of Society, they have to live with them. It seems like shes being pushy, because Wax chafes under High Society parties. Turns out that shes just as uncomfortable with it as he is, just better at hiding it.
</li><li> The schedule looks like she's going to dictate Wax's whole life. It turns out that she only wrote it for when they're together, and doesn't care what he does alone.
</li><li> Her marriage contract allows both of them to take potential mistresses, remarking that shell abstain from a dalliance until an heir is produced. On the first reading, its foreshadowing for how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marasi is her half-sister by her fathers mistress, not her cousin</span>. On the second reading, its an implicit way of telling him that shes fine with whatever he does in his personal life; at the end of the book, she tells him that neither of them can expect the other to change, but she's content with that.
</li><li> During their first public appearance together, Steris dictates the topic of conversation, and is distressed when Wax, Wayne, and Marasi eagerly jump on the topic of the Roughs, especially when they talk about how Wax once shot a dogs balls off. Later conversations reveal that the topic itself was irrelevant; Steris has difficulty being spontaneous and needs to plan her sentences in advance, and so any digression took her out of her depth.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWellOfMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWellOfMoments">The Well of Moments</a></em>, on reread you get to see exactly what happened in Toshiro's original lair that messed up his face, explaining his unusual display of anger. Maxwell's indignation when Jasmine steals the Well from him makes way more sense, and is much funnier, knowing what his preconceptions were (and also that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was forewarned she would shoot him, albeit not fatally</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame">The Westing Game</a></em> has so many such bonuses that, even after a hundred times, with each reread you notice some new facet of Sam Westing's manipulations that led to every single character getting their own individual happy ending. Plus tons of foreshadowing and other hints planted throughout the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> saga is so heavy with foreshadowing and elaborate plot weaving that second reading feels more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnotatedEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnotatedEdition">The Annotated Edition</a>, so many previously unnoticed details strike into eyes.

</li><li> Similarly season three makes it clear why the Second World War Nazi offshoot HYDRA somehow became the multi-ethnic organization it appeared as in the modern day, why HYDRA separated so quickly from the Nazis, and why HYDRA members become annoyed at being called Nazis; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> HYDRA long predates Nazism and their connection was only a temporary alliance at best.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> often has jokes that only make sense after you've seen later episodes. The Rita storyline, in particular, stands out: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Who would have thought the behavior of a spy and a Mentally Retarded Female could be so similar?</span>
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, this was called <a class="urllink" href="http://ubots.com/b5/jms_on_b5.shtml#ARC4">Holographic Storytelling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that if you read two scripts, went back and reread the first one, you could see things in it that you hadn't seen before. When you read three, again glanced over the first - and new things had come out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blindspot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blindspot">Blindspot</a></em> explicitly shows how Jane's apparently trivial and innocuous missions for Oscar over a number of episodes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> were used to frame Mayfair for murder</span>, but a more subtle one is the reveal that Orion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had been a black ops squad working for the CIA, likely under the direction of Carter, and Jane had been a member of the unit</span>. All of a sudden Carter's fixation on killing Jane makes a great deal more sense than simply being an overreaction to her being connected to someone who knew about Operation Daylight.
<ul><li> Likewise, many seemingly random and quiet moments in season 4 take a new meaning in the finale as it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's all part of a massive scheme by Madeline Burke to frame the team for terrorist attacks and have them become fugitives while Burke lands a job with the FBI to destroy it from within.</span>

<ul><li> For the series as a whole, getting greater insight into Walter's motivations and psyche later in the show, can put scenes and conversations from earlier in the show, going all the way back to the pilot episode, into a whole new, and much more disturbing, light.

Buffy in a dream sequence sees a clock at 7:30, and Tara says it's slow. In the same scene, she ominously says "be back before dawn". The next episode introduces Buffy's younger sister, named Dawn.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> retroactively does this with a handful of Season 3 episodes after the abrupt death of Prue at the end of the season.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jgri');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4jgri" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jgri');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty">Shannen Doherty</a> left the show</span> Episodes like "Sin Francisco" and "Death Takes A Halliwell" have other characters calling Prue out on her reckless demon hunting behaviour. Other episodes like "Just Harried" have her learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about not needing to devote so much time to her witch duties. In her final episode "All Hell Breaks Loose" those very character traits lead to her death.
</li><li> The numerous flashbacks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> get this once the killer and their motive is revealed. Things said/done take on much more significance. For example, in the episode "Forever Blue", this is said about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> victim as he arrives late and disheveled at the christening of his best friend's son.
<div class="indent"><strong>Father:</strong> Isn't it about time he got married? <br/><strong>Friend:</strong> You gotta go on a second date for that.
</div><ul><li> In that context, it makes him sound like a womanizer. However, once you realize that he's gay, you realize that he never went on a second date, not because he couldn't be satisfied by only one woman but because he couldn't be satisfied by <em>any</em> woman. To make matters worse, he was also secretly in love with his partner who he saw all the time. He probably thought that if he kept going out with women, he could suppress his feelings.
</li><li> There's also the fact that his partner's wife is very cold to him. One thinks it's because he's late, then another flashback implies that it's because that <em>they've</em> been having an affair and she's angry about his sleeping around. Another flashback reveals it's because she walked in on him and her husband kissing.
</li><li> There's also this little tidbit between the victim's partner and father right before the above-mentioned exchange when he arrives looking disheveled and tucking his shirt in:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Father:</strong> Brawl or Babe? <br/><strong>Friend:</strong> Brawl. Got a Babe. <em>[cue wife looking very displeased]</em>
</div><ul><li> Again, this makes him sound like a carefree irresponsible womanizer and sort of plays into the idea that he's got an affair with the wife but is possibly double-timing her. Upon rewatching one realizes just <em>why</em> his partner was so sure it was a 'brawl' and more importantly that the 'babe' is <em>the partner himself</em>.
</li><li> <em>Cold Case</em> flashbacks are also good for this because while they're always a literal representation of events, they don't have to show context. More than once, the show has shown a flashback scene, only to reveal that either the entire thing was a sham, or that there was a part of the conversation they didn't see that told a different story.

When arrested, he reveals this "mistress" was just a woman who sat next to on a flight and then stalked him. Looking back, it's clear the woman's behavior, her lack of actual contact with her "boyfriend" and the fact several of their photos together looked odd (they were photoshopped) were tip-offs.

It's difficult to catch on first viewing that these similar melodies are used to thematically compare and contrast the different lyrics being put to them. To give a few examples:
<ul><li> The melody for Eponine's "On My Own" - a song about the character admitting to herself that her love for Marius is delusional - is used at various other points where characters are suffering from comforting delusions - Fantine on her deathbed, Cosette protesting that Valjean doesn't have to die yet, etc.
</li><li> Valjean and Javert both have contrasting soliloquies to very similar melodies, but where Valjean's keeps increasing in pitch as he "climbs to the light" to become a better person, Javert's remains around the same pitch until suddenly jumping up on the final note as he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> commits suicide</span> - because Javert doesn't manage to find any means of escape from his own emotional and moral pit other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> death</span>.
</li><li> One melody is recycled for various instances of Valjean protesting miscarriages of justice - first against himself ("Now every door is closed to me/Another jail another key"), then against Fantine ("You've done your duty, let her be/She needs a doctor, not a jail"), then against his unfortunate doppelganger ("You say this man denies it all/And gives no sign of understanding").

They are separated, but Reznov turns up years later as a Russian defector and joins Mason's MACV-SOG unit on their various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">black ops,</a> going as far as wearing an American uniform; he actually blends in frighteningly well with American Marines whenever they're around. MACV-SOG has a precedent for this in the form of Grigori Weaver, another Russian defector whom Mason has to assure others is trustworthy despite being Russian. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out Reznov died in the camp and from then on is actually a figment of Mason's imagination, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em> style. He's wearing an American uniform because Mason is replacing a random American with Reznov in his mind, but the player finds nothing strange about Reznov joining the unit and wearing the uniform because of previously seeing Weaver. Because Reznov is also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, the unbelievability is further mitigated by the fact that a weak excuse is satisfactory if it allows him to have more screen time.

<ul><li> The sequel has a noticeable example as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arthur occasionally coughs throughout the story, but it's subtle enough most players don't pay any attetion to it until he starts coughing up blood, passes out, and is diagnosed with tuberculosis late into the game.

Here are a few more examples.
<ul><li> Nearly every single opening video shows something that happens later in the game, and you'll only fully understand the openings once you've beaten them. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kratos and Lloyd about to duel, presumably to release Origin.</span> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eldrant and Asch and Luke's final duel on top of it, and the hyperresonance that destroys Akzeriuth.</span> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">anime</a> eventually shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luke speaking with Lorelei and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PietaPlagiarism">holding Asch in his arms</a>, which is basically the second-last scene.</span> The very first image in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em> shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> adult Sophie at the end of the future arc.

Guilty conscience, perhaps?
</li><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, you learn that Guy was initially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in league with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Van.</span> Play the game again and check out the conversation Guy has with Van in the manor in the first hour. Van mentions something about "leaving everything" to Guy, just as Luke approaches, and then Pere, who's also hanging around, shouts "Master Luke!" Seems like an incongruous exchange the first time, but the second time...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wait a second, is Pere <em>spotting</em> for them to make sure Luke doesn't overhear their conversation? Genius!</span>
<ul><li> Similarly. there are a few instances where, if you are playing the game the second time around, it actually becomes a little more <em>painful</em>.

An early scene has Alvin describing his gun as a magical device that summons fire spirits.

On a second, you know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's lying: it's just a normal gun.

As some examples:
<ul><li> If you call Master Miller shortly after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Donald Anderson"</span> dies in front of Snake, and you'll get Miller in total surprise at the death.

Ada is trying to accomplish her mission at all costs and she has to keep up her identity as a "civilian" without Leon catching on.

For example, the subtitles refer to them as "A Gentleman" and "A Lady", which are also used to refer to the Luteces until their names are learned; they talk about "experiments", which should give away that they're scientists; they even sound exactly the same. The only attempt to mask their identity is the fact that their faces are hidden</span>.
<ul><li> Furthermore, their back and forth of "He doesn't row?" "No, he <em>doesn't</em> row" "Oh, I understand" seems like bizarre nonsense the first time you hear it.

Besides the reveals justifying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">why no one has emotions, why Sera has godlike powers, and why everyone knows about things that don't exist in the Junkyard</span>, the biggest standout is the creepy and mostly unexplained Disneyland-expy called Destinyland.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, many things about the character makes more sense and those little details fall into place neatly.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons a lot of players (who played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallChapters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallChapters">Dreamfall Chapters</a></em> episode-by-episode) recommended playing it again was this. Among the most notable is the fact that Queenie and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Old Lady Alvane</span> have the same voice actor and that bottle of Biju Zoë gives is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> part of the potion Saga creates</span>. Due to the fact that the last episode featuring Queenie was in 2015, and the Biju was given in 2014, a <em>lot</em> of people actually missed this.

Of particular note, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's a lot easier to see that Manny is orchestrating events to ensure that he and Graham are the final competitors because he sees Graham as the weakest link and therefore the easiest to beat</span>.

For example, if the player chooses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Josh</span> as the person they dislike the most, Dr. Hill will say that he understands you better and to go easy on said person. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The "you" in this case is Josh and you are telling <em>your hallucination of your psychiatrist</em> that you despise yourself the most.</span>
<ul><li> Earlier on, Josh mentions to Sam that it will probably take a traumatic event for Chris and Ashley to confess their feelings for each other and that Chris wouldn't say anything about how he felt for Ashley unless someone puts a gun to his head. Both comments are said jokingly as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> but it takes a darker turn once the player finds out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that Josh was the Psycho and he deliberately engineered traumatic events and the death traps revolving around Chris and Ashley in hopes that his best friend and his crush would get together.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> The game contains a <em>musical</em> example: the main theme, Edge of Dawn, definitely warrants a re-listen once you realize <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a>, apparently Edelgard expressing regret for what she's become and nostalgia for her time in the academy. Notably, the song plays for the credits on all the routes in which Edelgard dies.</span>
</li><li> If you have Dimitri and Edelgard fight in the mock Battle of the Eagle and Lion in Chapter 7, she tells him "If the Empire and the Kingdom go to war, we'll be able to fight as much as we please" and he replies "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">I'm sorry, but that is not something to joke about</a>. The thought of fighting you is troubling at best".

</li><li> Many scenes with the Death Knight take on a new meaning after the 3rd wave of DLC revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jeritza and the Death Knight aren't the same person, per se, but rather the Knight is his split-personality.

<ul><li> Many of the cases in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> start out fairly simple and then head into complicated territory, to the point where you may have forgotten a small detail mentioned in the first day that had no significance until the final day. Special mention goes to the <em>Investigations</em> sub-series, mostly the second game. As the cases are a lot more connected than in the rest of the series, it's a real eye-opener going back and seeing all the foreshadowing.
</li><li> So much of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation">cryptic conversations</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">chicanery</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">deception</a> that watching it again is almost like watching a different story, especially with the large amount of foreshadowing. It's also out of order, meaning the first parts of the story only shows part of the picture (like in the case where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Keiichi's murder victim is mysteriously moved</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">even more confusing</a> when one first experiences it, especially with the question of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">whether the story is a fantasy or a mystery</a>, but after certain revelations, reading through it again has many strange details make much more sense. For example, rereading the first few episodes knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shannon, Kanon and Beatrice are only alter egos created by Sayo Yasuda</span> completely changes the scenes where they are talking to each other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since it's eventually made clear that the conversations between Shannon, Kanon and Beatrice are only happening in Sayo's head and symbolize the conflicts in her heart</span>. A reread after learning about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sayo and her motive</span> also changes several of the locked rooms from seemingly impossible to solvable and/or heartbreaking.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a></em> has a lot of this. Even after getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> you probably <em>still</em> need to replay each girl's story route at least 2-3 times in order to truly catch and understand everything. Shizune's route in particular is so full of subtext that a lot of things, including the emotional element of Shizune and Hisao's relationship, tends to go over a lot of players heads on the first playthrough unless they are <em>really</em> paying attention.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape">Zero Escape</a></em> series you'd be hard pressed to find a character who isn't harbouring a massive secret of some sort (even among the POV protagonists) meaning everyone's actions are interpreted differently on a second playthrough. On top of that, there are plot twists and mechanics that manipulate the fundamental basics of user interface that will change the player's perception of things they didn't even realise could be altered.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Shuichi gets the cameras, the story does not advance until you, as Kaede, investigate the shot put balls, resulting in her picking one up. The first murder is committed with a shot put ball.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> It's rather interesting to watch the prologue again and note what lines up with what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> claims at the end of the game and what doesn't.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaede is somewhat more verbally abrasive towards Shuichi (although she does apologize, so it can be chalked up to stress) and explicitly states how rotten she thinks the world is. Her audition tape shows she was a misanthropic nihilist before her entrance into the killing game.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaede recalls how nobody lifted a finger to help her when she was abducted in broad daylight. Of course, nobody would think twice about Team Danganronpa "recruiting" their contestants.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaede's dialogue indicates some familiarity with who the Monokubs are. She likely knows about them from her auditions.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Monokubs refer to the Ultimate Hunt as the "backstory". It's all a plot device to set up how they ended up in the killing game.</span>
</li><li> However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaede, Shuichi, and Rantaro all explicitly identify themselves with the names they use during the killing game, and Kaede notes that she plays piano as a hobby, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> claiming that every aspect of their lives was created for the killing game. It was probably easier to modify what was already there than to fabricate something from scratch.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Much of what Kiyo says takes on a different meaning after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chapter 3, in which he's revealed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who kills girls to allow his dead older sister to make friends</span>.

<ul><li> Kamen warns Hiro not to break Momoko's heart, specifying that he might do so by cheating on her.

</li><li> Raiko's discomfort at a story about two sisters killing each other becomes a lot more poignant when you hear that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raiko's older sister died (vaguely implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>), and Reiko feels responsible</span>.

</li><li> If you have Raiko say that she came to the party to see Kamen(who, at this point, has shown little but outright contempt for Raiko), Kamen's surprised. Kamen appears overwhelmed with emotion as Raiko mentions that there's something she forgot... at least until Raiko asks what she did to get on Kamen's bad side. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The truth is that Kamen is deeply grateful to Raiko for saving her from being accused of shoplifting, and her hostility toward Raiko is due to being upset over how much Raiko changed (since Raiko's sister died shortly after Raiko first met Kamen).</span>

<ul><li> A keen eye may notice the time traveler Blendin Blandin in the background of several episodes before his official debut in "The Time Traveler's Pig".
</li><li> Several actions and quotes of Grunkle Stan (such as his shocked reaction to the wax statue of himself in "Headhunters") take on new meaning after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of his twin at</span> the end of "Not What He Seems".
</li><li> Revisiting "The Time Traveler's Pig" after "A Tale of Two Stans" makes it clear to the viewer that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the person in what would become the Mystery Shack when Dipper and Mabel briefly travel to the distant past in the former episode is not Stan, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Ford</a>.</span>
</li><li> In "Dreamscaperers", we see that part of Stan's mindscape is made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedPlayground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedPlayground">a creepy, decaying swingset</a>. Given that most of Stan's mindscape is based on the Mystery Shack, this doesn't make much sense. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fast-forward to the credits of "Not What He Seems," where we see Stan and his brother as children, sitting on a similar swingset, quietly watching a sunrise.</span>

<ul><li> After Twilight becomes an alicorn, and eventually the Princess of Friendship, much of the actions that her mentor Princess Celestia took can now be seen as her preparing her student for the role.
</li><li> In "Swarm of the Century", the first time viewers see Pinkie trying to round up some random instruments while the titular Swarm are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">eating everyone's homes and possessions</a>, it appears she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">being her usual random self</a>, but it turns out there's reason behind it — she knows about the Parasprites and how to get rid of them.
</li><li> Everything learned about Chrysalis being Cadance in disguise in the Season 2 finale become important in rewatches since the audience knows why "Cadance" acted evil from the start, as opposed to it being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bridezilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bridezilla">wedding day nerves</a>.
</li><li> In the Season 8 finale, once you learn that Cozy Glow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turned out to be the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>,</span> it casts her earlier appearances in the season in a new light.
</li><li> After the reveal that Ahuizotl was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a> guardian spirit who had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">misjudged by Daring Do</a>, some very minor details about his past "villainy" become a lot more relevant on rewatch. His first time being explicitly evil is taking place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">in one of Daring Do's books</a>, and his second time of being "evil" involves unleashing a centralized heat wave on a valley where, if you pay close attention, all the native animals and ponies of the valley <em>are freely helping him accomplish</em>.
</li><li> The reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Discord was disguised as Grogar</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> becomes much more relevant throughout the season since it was all a test for Twilight to see if she is ready to become the new ruler, and he gives plenty of hints throughout.
</li></ul></li><li> Watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a></em> with the knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Conrad Fleem is actually Todd &amp; Riley's uncle</span> makes certain things regarding the titular replacements make sense. After all, why would a successful businessman allow two kids he doesn't know to replace people for any reason?
</li><li> ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsWhoShotMrBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsWhoShotMrBurns">The Simpsons "Who Shot Mr. Burns?"</a> features a significant number of subtle hints towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of the shooter which the viewer won't pick up on until future viewings when they start paying attention to the character's actions throughout both episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> notably has several bits of foreshadowing that aren't as noticeable on the first viewing. In particular, the twist that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Norman Osborn was the Green Goblin all along and framed his son to take the blame</span> has several bits that subtly hint at the reveal long before it occurs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> often has hints in the dialogue and background that can be connected to things that are revealed later.
<ul><li> For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E37AloneTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E37AloneTogether">"Alone Together"</a> provides some interesting hints at Garnet being a fusion of two gems, Ruby and Sapphire. Garnet is the most gleeful and encouraging of Steven and Connie fusing into one person, calling it an experience that is meant to be enjoyed. Also, when the other Gems say that fusion is hard for them to comfort Steven's initial failed attempts, Garnet deadpans that it isn't for her. She's right, it isn't since she spends her entire life as a fusion.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E28MessageReceived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E28MessageReceived">"Message Received"</a>, all of Peridot's dialogue from the beginning of the episode ends up being an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> when we learn that her plan was to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convince Yellow Diamond to spare the Earth</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">The Movie</a>:
<ul><li> On a second viewing, the shot of a dark, abandoned location (later revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink Diamond's garden</span>) that appears during the broadcast of Steven's message blatantly has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spinel's foot</span> in the middle <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/d/d7/SU_Movie_039.png/revision/latest?cb=20190904012538">of it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The first time you listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">"Other Friends"</a>, it sounds like a bunch of confusing threats and demands. The second time you listen to it after watching the movie you realize it's Spinel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">listing all the ways Pink Diamond hurt her</span>.
</li><li> During the brief montage where Steven and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spinel</span> look for Amethyst, Onion appears in each visited area.

After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the villainous reveals of Jonathan Rook and Malcolm Kane</span>, their behavior throughout the whole series takes on a whole new meaning, particularly how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rook just happened to benefit from Stretch Monster's actions, how Rook was in awe of Stretch Monster's feats, and how Kane seemed incompetent when dealing with the Tech Men</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Toonsylvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Toonsylvania">Toonsylvania</a></em> episode "WereGranny" has Igor and Phil believe they've turned Dr. Vic's visiting grandmother into a werewolf and they both desperately try to cure her of her lycanthropy while doing whatever they can to prevent her grandson from seeing her transforming. One scene has Dr. Vic show his grandmother his telescope and ask if she'd like to see the moon, Granny replying that he knows how she is and giggling. This scene doesn't seem important at first, but after a second viewing stands out as an early hint that Granny Frankenstein was already a werewolf before she visited and that Dr. Vic was already aware of his grandmother being a werewolf.
</li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> have many retroactive moments that foreshadow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Sari's true heritage.</a></span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. Various details revealed over the course of the seasons make past character behaviours a lot more interesting in retrospect- most notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> M'gann being a White Martian, Roy being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone</a> and the fact that Kaldur is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a>, not a traitor at all.</span>

<ul><li> This is known as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/">The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After you learn a new piece of information, you begin noticing it all around you. For example, learning of a new math term only to then discover that said math term has been present in previous equations, even though you didn't know about it at the time.
<ul><li> Or as Lewis Black put it in layman's terms: "One day, your friend tells you about a bear he saw walking down the street, and you say "oh, that's ridiculous". And the next day, the bear's following you around!"
</li><li> Maybe something like, oh I don't know, an online database of recurring motifs and themes in media <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTropesWillRuinYourLife">that makes it impossible to not notice them</a>.
