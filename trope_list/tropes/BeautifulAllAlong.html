</p><p>Another version of this would be "Miss Jones Syndrome", where a dowdy, bespectacled woman switches to contacts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShakingHerHairLoose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShakingHerHairLoose">shakes loose her hair</a>, and is told by the unrequited object of her affections, "Why, Miss Jones, you <em>are</em> beautiful."
</p><p>This is mainly possible because most of the "ugly" women on TV or in the movies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">beautiful actresses in bad clothes</a>, though it also has something to do with Hollywood's unforgivingly narrow standards of physical attractiveness, particularly for women.

The trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a>, often differs in that while the girl in question might like rough casual clothes or work gear most of the time, she knows damn well she can look stunningly good when she wants to be.

</li><li> Often used in many ads with "Before" and "After" pictures - a simple cure for baldness can turn a depressing nerdy guy into a hunk by not just fixing his hair, but his eyesight (causing him to lose the glasses), his skin, his clothes, his glum frown into a confident smile, etc.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em> Sophie believes herself to be ugly. It doesn't help that other girls agree, and she's wearing clothes a good 50 years out of date. Howl, however, can see her as her true self and comments that she's beautiful, which she denies, at which point her temporary change back to a young girl ends. At the end, Sophie ditches the ugly hat, gets some new clothes, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown">Letting Her Hair Down</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which becomes silver. She breaks the curse, realizing her value and admits to Howl that she believes her silver hair to be beautiful</span>.
<ul><li> Of course, a witch turns her into a hunched over old lady for much of the movie, although the curse seems to come and go.
</li></ul></li><li> In the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>, Narusegawa Naru goes from looking like a total nerd to being beautiful by removing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a> and taking her hair out of massive braids. Then again, her "ugly" state is a deliberate act intended to drive off unwelcome male attention.
</li><li> Likewise, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent">Strawberry 100%</a></em>, Toujou Aya becomes better looking by letting her bangs down, and beautiful by taking off her glasses and unbraiding her hair.
</li><li> A subtle subversion is Chisame Hasegawa of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. In her daily school life she is a bespectacled computer geek, allegedly with bad skin. But at home she takes off her glasses, combs out her hair, and takes digital pictures of herself in costumes, which she then photoshops to clear up her skin and increase her bustline — and becomes the virtual idol "Chiu" on her website. Of course, her teacher Negi insists that she's cute enough as-is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild">but he's ten</a>, what does <em>he</em> know? Her problems with her appearance may be one reason she seems to prefer remaining in the form of a ten-year-old via the age pills, during the Magic World arc...
<ul><li> Asuna's friends are also rather surprised at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">how normal and even elegant</a> Asuna can look without her hair ornaments, dressed normally and not kicking people in the face.
</li></ul></li><li> Chika Ogiue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em>. Normally, her strange paintbrush hair and baggy clothes mar her appearance, but occasionally she lets her hair down, puts on more form-fitting clothes, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">swaps her contacts out for glasses</a> and turns out to be quite attractive.
<ul><li> Katou can also be considered this, as she turns out to be quite beautiful when that long, shaggy mop of hair isn't covering her face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em> this trope is played in the classic fashion. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a> takes off her glasses, lets her hair down, and the object of her affections (who doesn't recognize her) almost immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute">bumps into her</a>, and thinks about how cute she is. Unfortunately for her, she couldn't recognize <em>him</em> without her glasses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, Guts thinks of Casca as a soldier, it isn't until she dolls up for the ball after their major victory that he realizes that she is beautiful. The other men at the ball (who didn't realize she was female until that point) agree with him, enough that she has to make her escape.
<ul><li> Hell you probably think of Guts as a downplayed male example, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">attitude</a> and attire dissuade women and people in general from finding him attractive (especially in comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Griffith</a>). However Guts much like Casca looks great in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">formal wear</a> and is considered handsome by women if they get a good look at him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a>,</em> Sunako, who shuns light and all forms of beauty, abruptly transforms from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> creature into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl">Aloof Dark-Haired Girl</a> when her friends are threatened or she has a brief bout of self-confidence.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IdatenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IdatenJump">Idaten Jump</a></em>: a handsome, brilliant fighter deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">hides his good traits and pose as a complete nerd</a> to protect his secret identity from his enemies.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NGKnightLamune40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NGKnightLamune40">Lamune &amp; 40</a></em> series makes this into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>; when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">Meganekko</a> Cocoa removes her glasses for any reason, everyone in the immediate area has this trope hit them hard — and she just says "What?" as she puts them back on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a>,</em> Nina Einstein, who looked extremely dorky and nerdy in the first season, returns in the second season with an updated look, that she looked quite beautiful.
</li><li> Skewed a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>: when Haruhi Fujioka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a> come off, the members of the titular club are startled to realize that she's really quite attractive — but Tamaki still thinks she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">boy</a> (unlike the other club members, who figured it out during the day).
<ul><li> Inverted the following episode when the club members managed to find a picture of Haruhi sporting long hair and in a schoolgirl uniform, and they question just how such a pretty girl could turn into someone so mousy and boyish looking (to which Haruhi replied that she cut her hair after some mischievous kid stuck bubblegum into it).
</li></ul></li><li> One of Akane's pet peeves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> is that, although female Ranma looks very ordinary in the standard, unisex Chinese uniform (which is tailored for Ranma's male form anyway), "she" is actually a beautiful woman otherwise. (Not to mention Ranma's apparently unconscious, instinctive ability to do both sexpot and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> at will...)
<ul><li> Not surprisingly, Ranma's mother, Nodoka, appears as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">attractive, but nondescript woman</a> in a kimono most of the time. When she lets her hair down, she goes from "pretty" to total babe in two seconds flat.
</li><li> Inverted by Mousse, who initially comes off as a Bishonen, but is a total moron who requires thick Coke-bottle glasses to function properly.
</li><li> Near the end of the series there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">domestic mother figure</a> Kasumi appears wearing the second-tiniest bikini in the entire episode (only raving loony Kodachi wears a smaller one), and accidentally wins a beauty contest (in which all the other girls have entered, and for which she is acting as a "card girl") when the (mostly male) audience decide they like her best.
</li><li> Minor example is Ukyo when she decides to dress like a girl. Even though every guy starts drooling over her, it's only a minor example because she was plenty cute enough already.
</li></ul></li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> filler arc, there was the minor villain Fuuma Kagerou. He pretty much looked like a gorilla with a huge overbite in his first appearance. Then he, literally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">shed his body and was revealed to be a quite beautiful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">girl</a>... Of course, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Kagerou's</a> general powers and abilities were inspired by the mayfly, this also meant that her remaining lifespan was reduced to a few hours through this act.
</li><li> The hentai manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereSlut">Were-Slut</a></em> combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a> (and, perhaps, a more subtle form of lycanthropy). After main character Kimiko swallows the Beauty Stone, she becomes so beautiful that she gets flak from her teachers about wearing make-up and has to hide her gorgeous looks behind her usual nerd-glasses. This also keeps people from realizing that she's the Were-Slut, a side-effect of the expired Beauty Stone that... well, it's hentai, so it should be obvious by now. Also subverted by the fact that the boy she took the Beauty Stone to seduce was already in love with her and she only needed to have more confidence in herself (or just be blindly in heat) to make him her boyfriend.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a>,</em> Maya, who is usually described as "plain-looking", is cast as a beautiful princess opposite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">the beautiful Ayumi</a>. Everyone thinks it's a complete miscast, and are extremely surprised by Maya's first appearance on stage. It only lasts as long as the stage makeup does and weirds out her friends.
</li><li> Megumi "Nodame" Noda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em> is actually a very attractive lady when she washes her hair and doesn't dress in mold-afflicted dirty clothes—and also refrains from shouting at the top of her lungs all the time or making silly faces.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hyakko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hyakko">Hyakko</a></em>:
<ul><li> Torako may not be really ugly, but her tomboyish demeanor usually lets her be outshined by girls like Ayumi—until she decides to get loose while posing for some photos.
</li><li> Tsubomiya Inori plays this straight. Her usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Sadako</a>-like appearance tends to repel people, but when Torako peels back her forelocks and gives her a makeover...<a class="urllink" href="http://i374.photobucket.com/albums/oo186/slayer545/snapshot20081127005821.jpg">wow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> Delightful example from Episode 8 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where it's applied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Tieria</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">Erde</a>.

</li><li> To show that this trope is not restricted to women, Mitsukake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> was first seen with long unkempt hair and a Grizzly Adams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow">Beard of Sorrow</a>. When he saved Miaka and the gang and revealed his real face, he was male model gorgeous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> has a one-off character, Princess Dia, who wore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a>. Once they were knocked off her face she was revealed to follow this trope. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> the Sailor Senshi wonder if this trope would apply to Umino if he removed his specs, complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> Umino <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the trope does indeed apply to Umino too</span>.
</li><li> This is the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mangaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mangaka">Mangaka</a> Marie Buraidaru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, once she loses her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses">Opaque Nerd Glasses</a>. Minako is genuinely shocked to see how pretty she is, and notes that Marie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtImitatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtImitatesLife">looks exactly like the heroine</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> manga she draws.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask">Gasmask</a>-wearing, minor character Busujima from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">Samus Is a Girl</a>.</span>
</li><li> A male version would be Charden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> who wears glasses and a top hat. When he takes these off he turns out to be a handsome blonde man with flowing curls.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> is killed through poison by his beautiful soon to be ex-manager, who is also his ex-girlfriend, because he treated her like garbage and lots of his abuse was about her physical features. Turns out he did this because she had cosmetic surgery to please him, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheWayYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheWayYouAre">he liked her "ugly" original face better</a> and heavily blamed himself for her change.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke">Kimi ni Todoke</a></em>: the protagonist, Sawako, becomes very pretty when she smiles genuinely - as opposed to her forced smile, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">scared everyone away until she entered high school</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em>, Uzume was an ugly woman being held as a prisoner by Chinese soldiers. After marrying Sarutahiko, she reveals that she's actually very beautiful and that she disguised herself as an ugly woman so that the soldiers wouldn't rape her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>: Inosuke Hashibara is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a> who fights like an animal and wears the hides of beasts, including a boar's head that covers his entire head. Underneath that boar's head, however, is a very soft and effeminate face framed by shoulder-length black hair.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateCrossBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateCrossBlade">Hayate × Blade</a></em>. Inu, who starts off looking like something that would make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a>'s</em> Sunako look normal, is given a makeover by her sister-in-arms Momoka. While she does look a lot prettier with her hair done up, she's still considered creepy by her peers thanks to her...odd mannerisms (and matching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubbles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechBubbles">Speech Bubbles</a>, which don't go away after her makeover).
</li><li> Gender flipped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/XamdLostMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/XamdLostMemories">Xam'd: Lost Memories</a></em>: Raigyo is first introduced as a <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/raigyobefore.jpg">funny looking bloke in desperate need of a shave and a haircut<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Then, about two thirds into his introductory episodes, he decides to go and <em>get</em> that shave and haircut and...well, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/raigyoafter.jpg">damn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em>. Newcomer Akiyaki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSexyFlanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSexyFlanders">spends a good fifteen seconds just ogling stupidly</a> before it even registers in his head that it's really the same guy.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/PigBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/PigBride">Pig Bride</a> is a young girl cursed with a facial deformity unless she can win over her destined boyfriend. At least, that's what she thinks, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it turns out that underneath the mask she's really a beauty</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em> where Rin (who is attractive, just too young) takes down her hair and tries to talk seductively to Manji in order to prove that she can be mature and lady-like. Manji simply bursts out laughing at her and mocks the trope itself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> (or at least in the <em>Overload!</em> manga spin-off) Kaname's best friend Kyoko is normally cute, but apparently looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangatoshokan.com/read/Full-Metal-Panic-Overload/senfgurke2/25/15">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with her hair down and her glasses removed. Played with in that the group of creepy fanboys stalking her aren't interested in her like this because they have a fetish for her "glasses and braids" look, although Kaname thinks she's adorable.
</li><li> Yura from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt">Honey Hunt</a></em> when she loses the glasses and does something with that hair.
</li><li> Played with fairly mercilessly in an episode of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleFighterMiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleFighterMiki">Noodle Fighter Miki</a> where our heroine meets a scary teacher who looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl</a>. Even her attempts to look friendlier just make her scarier. However, she has the ability to become quite attractive and give off an extremely friendly vibe, <em>but apparently only while she's eating ramen</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Beauty Pop</em>, this pretty much covers all the girls Kiri makes over. Kanako's second makeover may be the closest to note, though, as it is revealed that her dowdy looks distracted people from her how perfect her hair, skin and nails are thanks to the instruction she's been taking from the SP in regards to their care.
</li><li> Vincent Law from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ErgoProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ErgoProxy">Ergo Proxy</a></em>. At the beginning he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">Eyes Always Shut</a>, a round face, and looks kinda short and dumpy. Some episodes later, after becoming a wanted man, he changes completely: he opens his eyes, musses his hair, loses some weight, stands up taller, and voilà!
</li><li> Eureka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> definitely deserves an honorable mention when she is not wearing her hairpin, as well as her long hair version in the movie ending. Renton is wise to fall for her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish">Princess Jellyfish</a></em>, Kuranosuke becomes convinced that Tsukimi is one of these, and decides to give her a makeover to prove it. Tsukimi was not amused, because she and the rest of the Amars think that making yourself over is like going over to the 'enemy' i.e. the side of the trendy people.
<ul><li> Kuranosuke thinks every girl is a princess but is quite realistic in that, while he may think that way, he knows most of the world does make assumptions based on appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brief</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> is revealed to be this in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">Cleans Up Nicely</a> scene.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>, Miranda Lotto lacked confidence in herself and suffering from the stress of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">the only one</a> not affected by the time loop affecting her town. It wasn't until she got her Innocence and became confident in her abilities (not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown">Letting Her Hair Down</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a>) that we truly see how beautiful Miranda was.
</li><li> Male example played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em>: delinquent gang leader Tatsuya Himekawa sports a gigantic pompadour and a pair of tacky shades, but when he's forced to take off the glasses and let down his hair, he could pass for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Sephiroth's</a> kid brother. No one recognizes him until his hair goes back up.
<ul><li> Played for more laughs because, despite the girls raving about how handsome Himekawa looks with his hair down, he persists in subverting the trope by <em>keeping</em> the ridiculous hairdo and shades for no particular reason at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Another male example appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>. After he gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a> and loses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpaqueNerdGlasses">Opaque Nerd Glasses</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leo</span> is revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">quite</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">beautiful</a> after all.

She usually wears a formal outfit. with thick glasses and her hair tied in a bun. When she plans to infiltrate Lupin's hideout, Zenigata objects that she's not pretty enough for Lupin to invite her inside. Cue her going inside her car, changing into a more revealing outfit, takes off her glasses, puts on makeup, and lets her hair down. Zenigata was shocked by her beauty.

</li><li> Hachiken's ancestress in a flashback chapter to medieval times. She's a narrow-eyed girl with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a> who is mistaken for a man at first, but it eventually becomes apparent that she's actually squinting because she needs glasses.

Mari is very plain and unfashionable before she meets Akko, but it seems more like Mari already wanted to pay more attention to make-up and fashion but didn't know what to do, and the emphasis is much more on the sheer fun of this new world Akko introduces to her.

Aurora wears her hair loose, and no glasses; Jeanne-Marie has a tight bun and "glasses you barely need for reading" (as her brother put it). While Jeanne-Marie is hardly ugly, she looks much more strict and severe than free-spirited Aurora. It reverses the trope, in that her (long lost twin) brother first saw her as Aurora, then was shocked to see her do up her hair and put on glasses <em>on purpose</em> to look less attractive. This is no Clark Kenting, either; she has multiple personality disorder, so this trope works to draw the line between two different people.

It eventually turned out that she was both an empath and a reflexive shapeshifter whose appearance reflected her feelings and the way everyone around her felt about her. She only seemed twisted and ugly because that's the way her home dimension treated her, but once Cap was nice to her for a while, she turned into a cross between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Galadriel</a>.

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NotAnotherTeenMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NotAnotherTeenMovie">Not Another Teen Movie</a></em> (whose main plot followed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesAllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesAllThat">She's All That</a></em>). The main character, Janie, a "rebellious" artist who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">seen as ugly</a> by all the other characters, gets a makeover by a popular girl. Before she begins, the popular girl warns Janie, "this may seem a bit crazy..." She then proceeds to take off her glasses and pull down her hair. Suddenly, everyone acknowledges her beauty, and she even gets her own slow-walk down a stairway shot, complete with music. Also parodied before that when she's nominated "hardest to make into the prom queen" because she has "glasses, a pony tail and paint-covered overalls". Candidates stated as "easier" to make over are an albino folksinger, twins joined at the head, and a hunchback.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaolinSoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaolinSoccer">Shaolin Soccer</a></em> subverts this not once but twice. The heroine, originally a rather ugly girl with terrible skin, gets a makeover in the hopes of attracting the hero, but the result is almost as bad; she ends up with streetwalker-thick makeup, '80s big hair and shoulder pads. Eventually she goes through a second transformation where she gives up on the makeup, etc., and shaves her head bald — and looks better than ever (one wonders what happened to the bad skin).
<ul><li> This is rather common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenChow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenChow">Stephen Chow</a> movies, in that almost all of his love interests have either physical flaws, or are characteristically flawed. One of the most memorable moments in Chow's movies before he became vastly famous was the ending scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodOfCookery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodOfCookery">God of Cookery</a>,</em> where the comically homely female street chef got an extreme makeover after he alleged death. The actress playing the role, however, is a famous Chinese pop star in real life, so her final appearance in the movie actually had her to do away with her faux ugly makeup.

</li><li> The scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em> where Clark Kent is in Lois's apartment with her (off-screen) getting ready for their date. He is debating whether to reveal to her that he is Superman, and the actor straightens his posture, removes his glasses (OK, he doesn't let down his hair, it isn't a perfect example of this trope), does something to his expression, and becomes the <em>extremely</em> attractive Superman. Lois (still off-screen) says something and he changes his mind, transforming instantly back into the nerdy and relatively unattractive Clark. An excellent piece of acting by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a>. In the original comics, Lois <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo">loved Superman</a> because she compared shy, clumsy, and cowardly (after all, he disappeared at the first sign of danger!) Clark against, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Superman</a>.
</li><li> Visible in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>. Who knew that getting thrown off a building, trashing her own house, and tearing up her clothes to make a catsuit would change dowdy secretary Selina Kyle so much? The book of the movie explains it's her self-confidence that makes her able to wear clothes that really suit her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>, Peter Parker loses his eyesight problems when he gains his spider powers, so he stops wearing glasses.

Although the actress is made up with things like rotting teeth, warts, and fungus, you can still tell she normally looks great.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985">Legend (1985)</a></em> for many fans, who consider Mia Sara more attractive as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">"Dark Lili"</a> than "Princess Lili". (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">Her costume</a> certainly didn't hurt.)

<ul><li> Though in this case, it's less of a broken aesop than normal, since when Ian meets Toula again after her makeover, he says "I remember you. I don't remember frump girl, but I remember you", implying that he liked her in the first instance anyway.
</li><li> The DVD commentary with the writer/lead actress also clarifies that the "makeover" was about Toula becoming more confident with herself as she developed her own identity outside of her parents' restaurant; it wasn't solely about looking pretty so she can catch guys.

By the time he returns, she looks terrific and has the self-confidence necessary to dump him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightWatch">Night Watch</a></em> film, the latent sorceress Svetlana is portrayed as your typical "librarian" with an average hairdo and glasses. Cut to the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DayWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DayWatch">Day Watch</a></em>, where she finds out about her magical abilities, she now wears her hair down and throws away the glasses. Suddenly, she is extremely attractive to the main character, not to mention a lesbian make-out scene in the shower.
</li><li> Done subtly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty">American Beauty</a></em> with Jane and inverted with Angela. At the start of the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThoraBirch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThoraBirch">Thora Birch</a> wears a lot of makeup to reflect how unhappy she is. As she starts dating Ricky and becomes a bit happier, she gradually wears less makeup as the film goes on. Mena Suvari then wears gradually more makeup as the film goes on, to reflect us finding out why she isn't so desirable.

Dull, colorless Mary hasn't had much of a life, living in a small town caring for her mother, so when Mom dies Mary decides to join the circus. Having spent the film learning to overcome lifelong inhibitions, she literally unpins her hair at the end. It's supposed to be an affirmation of freedom, but owing to Elizabeth's expression it comes off more like Instant Sexpot.
</li><li> For about a quarter of the runtime of <em>Some Freaks</em>, Jill is overweight and dressed in a deliberately off-putting semi-"punk rock" style (including piercings and green hair worn in an "undercut"). Partway through the film, she graduates high school and moves to college in California, where she loses 50 pounds, stops wearing her piercings, keeps her hair long and in her natural blonde color, and dresses more conventionally. She surprises her high school boyfriend with the changes, but he likes her better the old way - he keeps trying to tempt her off her diet, to the point of trying to trick her into eating some extremely fatty homemade mac and cheese, which leads to their breakup. It's also notable that even after her makeover, she's still considered heavy enough to be invited to a frat's "cattle call", a frat party where all attendees must invite a fat girl.
</li><li> Mahana in the 1969 short film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyLingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyLingo">Johnny Lingo</a></em> is constantly called ugly. After the titular character buys her dowry for eight cows, she's suddenly beautiful.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInvisible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInvisible">The Invisible</a></em>, Annie spends the first hour of the film wearing a black wool cap pulled low and all black clothes, looking like the picture of a teenage thug. Then, hiding out in a crowded club, she pulls off the hat and lets her long wavy hair loose and tosses her face up, reveling in the music and anonymity, and Nick just walks around her and stares at how suddenly beautiful she is.

When she was young she actually was rather unattractive (never quite "ugly," per se, but tall and gangly and generally plain), but in recent years (starting a year or two before the first novel, <em>On Basilisk Station</em>) she has begun to grow into her looks, and is now described by most characters as having a sharp-edged and exotic beauty. The problem is that, with prolong, it took her <em>sixty years</em> to finally get to this point, so her self-image as an ugly child is pretty much carved in stone, compounded by the additional factors of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> in her childhood and having a mother who has always been regarded as gorgeous.

The Beast's castle is completely without mirrors or even still water, making it that much easier for her to avoid seeing herself; she is thus pleasantly surprised when at the end of the novel the (former) Beast points her at a mirror and she sees that she's bloomed over the course of the book into a very lovely young woman.

She has been cursed and enslaved by an evil witch, who forces her to hide her face behind a leather mask whenever she is out among people. The mask, combined with the fact that she's usually walking hunched-over due to terrible stomach cramps brought on by the witch's curse, causes the general population to think she's a hobgoblin in service of the witch. The only ones allowed to see her without her mask are her four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalCompanion">Animal Companions</a>, who have no concept of human beauty and honestly can't tell whether she is ugly or not. Of course, any reader who has even <em>remotely</em> paid attention can guess that the girl is stunningly gorgeous behind her mask, but for most of the novel Thing really has no reason to think of herself as anything but ugly.

Then she applies for a job at the Boar's Nest and decides to shed all this for her trademark tight short-shorts, her hair let down and no more glasses.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver (1985)</a></em> ("Twice Stung") references the cliche- for his next trick, Mac needs a woman's glasses, her hairpins and the top three buttons of her shirt (upper cleavage level). She complies and it turns out to be part of the con that they're pulling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jake20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jake20">Jake 2.0</a></em> featured an almost painfully ridiculous invocation of this trope in episode 6 "Last Man Standing", wherein Diane Hughes (the NSA doctor tasked with monitoring Jake's nanite functions) accompanies an ailing Jake to a wedding to look after him. Despite the fact that Keegan Connor Tracy (the actress portraying Diane) is almost unfairly good looking, they pull this trope with her by straightening her hair and removing her glasses. The reveal is impressively goofy.
</li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge">Charles in Charge</a></em> ("A Date With Enid", broadcast 12/05/84) featured some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">play with this trope</a>. Enid, a classic early-80s girl nerd with ugly glasses and hair up in an awful style, is Douglas' first crush. She expresses a desire to be more attractive to him. Citing the old "take off glasses and shake out hair, voila she's beautiful" cliche, Enid fears that it won't be that easy for her. They spend the entire episode trying things to prettify her that fail horribly, only to discover at the end all she had to do was... take off her glasses and shake out her hair. Of course, the twist is that Douglas now thinks they "ruined" her...
</li><li> A parody of this trope was done on the first season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>, "Visiting Ours". G.O.B. has to seduce his father's secretary, and in the process he tells her to take off her glasses and let down her hair, revealing her to be cross-eyed with bad, poofy hair.
<div class="indent">"OK, keep the hair, back on the glasses."
</div><ul><li> What makes this a more thorough subversion than usual is the fact that with her glasses and done up hair, she is reasonably attractive, but without them she becomes rather unnerving looking.
<ul><li> Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGreer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGreer">Judy Greer</a> is in fact quite attractive in real life. Fans speculate that the show was intentionally trying to make her incrementally more attractive with each new appearance (sometimes with justifications, like her stealing a bunch of money for breast augmentation surgery) until by her final appearance on the show she's pretty smokin' hot — but everyone still treats her the same way.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> had something similar to this with Pugsley's teacher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse">American Horror Story: Murder House</a></em> plays this for pathos when Addie, who appears to have Down Syndrome, wants to "look pretty" for Halloween, wearing the makeup Violet put on her, instead of wearing the ugly rubber mask her mom wants her to wear. Her mom is furious at Addie for doing this, but eventually, reluctantly lets her daughter go out without the mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> had a notable inversion in the episode where Theo's teacher (Brazilian superstar Sonia Braga) came to dinner at the Huxtables' home. Prior to her appearance onscreen Theo had been describing her in unflattering terms, but when she finally arrives she is (to his shock and surprise) stunning. She <em>stays</em> stunning until she has to be "Teacher" again with his parents, at which point she casually puts her long hair up into a bun and puts on heavy glasses. She doesn't stop being beautiful, but the transformation is still impressive.
</li><li> Inverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveAmericanStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveAmericanStyle">Love, American Style</a></em>, a new young executive is constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">distracted</a> by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySecretary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySecretary">Sexy Secretary</a>, played by Carol Wayne. Whenever she is in the room he becomes a bumbling moron and is in danger of getting fired for incompetence. However, when he learns that she needs heavy glasses to read fine print, he asks her to wear them around the office all the time since he doesn't find her attractive when she has them on.
</li><li> Lisa Zemo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a>,</em> former epitome of the image of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd">Nerd</a> with no fashion sense, big glasses, and chronic nasal problems, became "hot" when she returned after a season break with "a new haircut, new clothes, new contacts, and new allergy medication."
</li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeansShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeansShow">Seans Show</a></em>; "Tie your hair up. Now, put on these glasses. My God, you're beautiful!"
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em>, a homely girl shows up on the island... and when given a makeover, looks exactly like Ginger Grant. Given that both characters were played by Tina Louise, people really should have seen this one coming.
</li><li> Subversion in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders">Midsomer Murders</a>:</em> A character, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing off her love rivals</span>, takes off her glasses, shakes down her hair, and goes looking for the object of her affection. He's creeped out, and when he learns what she's done, horrified.
</li><li> This trope happens just around mid-run of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoSoyBettyLaFea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoSoyBettyLaFea">Yo soy Betty, la fea</a></em>, where the titular protagonist, who has been considered ugly since birth, embraces a makeover. Interesting because the makeover is treated more as a metaphor of her newly gained maturity (and she resists at some stages), because not everybody thinks she looks prettier now, and because it happens by slow steps: first she gets a new hairdo; then she trades her ugly, horn-rimmed glasses for a pair of cute, modern, minimalist glasses; then she gets rid of her bad-fitting clothes and gets more fashionable ones; and in the last chapter of the soap she finally gets rid of her orthodontics treatment and shows the results. Notably averted (dream sequences aside) in the US version's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty">Ugly Betty</a></em> since she doesn't seem to have many hang-ups about her body and her odd fashion sense is an expression of her individuality (although they will be addressing the braces soon).
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode does this with a beautification drug. A woman realizes she doesn't need it and her confidence was what was truly responsible for her attractiveness when she's given a placebo. (Turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, though: Apparently, "confidence" completely re-does one's hair and makeup, makes the lighting more flattering, and even generates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl">soft focus</a> effect.)
<ul><li> Inverted in the episode "The Menagerie" where it is ultimately revealed that Vina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaussianGirl">Gaussian Girl</a> beauty is, quite literally, only an illusion.
<ul><li> Her beauty was real, before she became horribly disfigured when her ship crash-landed on the planet, and she became older; the Talosians simply restored it via the illusion. Also this was done in "The Cage", the abandoned series-pilot; but it's made into an Aesop in "The Menagerie", when Pike also becomes horribly disfigured, and Spock risks everything to also give Pike the illusion of his former beauty.
</li><li> Beauty and ability to move around and actually <em>do</em> stuff. Pike was horribly debilitated, Vina less so but not enviable (Pike makes a light blink once for yes and twice for no, and that's the extent of his functionality. Vina... think scoliosis or polio, when it comes to movement.)
</li><li> Also illogical since Vina says they put her together wrong because "... they had never seen a human being." However, except for their giant heads the Talosians look exactly like us so really they should have done it right.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rh9w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1rh9w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rh9w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This might be a holdover from an earlier draft of the script, where the Talosians were supposed to be humanoid crabs, and were changed to humans with big heads for budget reasons</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> when Lane stops wearing her glasses to look better to Zach, who prefers her with them. Agreeing that she looked better before and imploring her to switch back is actually how he and her disapproving mother first start to get along. Though she wasn't trying to appeal to Zach. She was unhappy with how her glasses came out in pictures the band had taken. And even after Zach tells her she looks better with the glasses, she does occasionally wear the contacts afterward, and the subject is never dwelt on again. So really the subversion comes in by the show just ignoring the "makeover" baggage that usually shows up when a girl takes off her glasses.
</li><li> Male example: In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>,</em> Hillary has a glasses-wearing boyfriend who she thinks looks better without them and makes him not wear them. This is only revealed after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm">accidentally rams Will's car</a>.
</li><li> Another Male example: In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em> the titular character decides to makeover an art student with glasses, shaggy hair, and a bad wardrobe. Of course, his handsome face and nice body always existed, and Raven begins to crush on him as soon as he finishes the transformation.
</li><li> This is actually done twice with Willow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>: although she neither wears glasses nor her hair in a bun, this is done by changing her out of her overalls-'n-jumpers outfits she wore through the first three seasons; in "Homecoming" she looks gorgeous in her formal gown and in "Doppelgangland" she astonishes the boys when she puts on Vamp Willow's sexy black leather outfit. Examining her chest, she says "Oh. Look at these." And do they ever!
<ul><li> Thrice, actually. The first time was in "Halloween:". Buffy convinces Willow to dress a little more racily for Halloween and Willow proceeds to put her hair up, apply a bit of make-up and wear a midriff top with black mini skirt and boots. She eventually feels too self-conscious and goes out wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost">Bedsheet Ghost</a> costume over the outfit. At the end she tosses the costume away and walks more confidently in the original outfit just as her future boyfriend Oz drives by and notices her.
<div class="indent"><strong>Oz:</strong> Who <em>is</em> that girl?
</div><ul><li> And of course it was played with in "Go Fish", with Buffy herself who confronts Angelus while drawing out the small stake she was holding her hair bun in place with, letting her hair fall in the process. Angelus immediately mocks the trope, saying "Why, Ms. Summers! You're <em>beautiful</em>!"
</li><li> This trope could also be applied to Xander in "Go Fish." He spends the majority of the series in rather unflattering clothes, and goes undercover ("Not under much," as Buffy says) on the swim team, and Cordelia, Buffy, and Willow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy">are rather stunned to find out that Xander has a good body when in a Speedo</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the episode "Inca Mummy Girl". Willow wears a dowdy and unsexy Eskimo costume to a cultural party and remarks that maybe she should have worn something sexy. However Oz ends up noticing her because of the costume.
</li></ul></li><li> Lizzi in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek">Greek</a></em> episode "See You Next Time, Sisters!" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">yes, that's the episode title</a>). Who knew that a straightening iron and a power suit could give a girl such confidence? Though it was less a confidence issue and more busting her out of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyOfficeGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyOfficeGirl">Plucky Office Girl</a> position to her boss, Tegan.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> ("Abnormal Psychology") had Diane trying to get Lilith and Frasier together by asking Lilith for a hairpin to fix the refrigerator door. Frasier scoffs at her transparent methods, but Lilith lets her hair down, and the two are instantly inflamed with lust for each other.
</li><li> In the second season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></em> episode "The Nowhere Affair", a THRUSH computer picks an ugly duckling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">sexy THRUSH scientist</a> to seduce Napoleon Solo, in the hopes of reversing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a> that was induced when Solo took "Capsule B" before his capture by THRUSH. The scientist does the statutory transformation from geeky to hottie by, of course, taking off her ugly glasses and white lab coat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown">Letting Her Hair Down</a>.
</li><li> Alex from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. A bespectacled, cute-at-best comic book nerd? Sorry, that position is already taken, and we've got quotas to fill. If it was just his "new identity" with a shave and one less pair of glasses, it would be debatable, but then that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">Shirtless Scene</a> came out of left field...
</li><li> Subverted in, of all places, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>. Miss Piggy was doing her usual routine of flirting with the male guest star— in this case, John Denver:
<div class="indent"><strong>Piggy:</strong> "Oh please, I would love to see you with your glasses off, Johnny, take them off for me please?" <br/><strong>Denver:</strong> (Removes his glasses.) <br/><strong>Piggy:</strong> (pause) "Put 'em back on, Denver."
</div></li><li> The MTV show <em>Made</em> had a number of episodes where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> or nerd girls wanted to become homecoming queen and are given a coach to transform them into one. The most startling transformation was Kitty from season 4. She was a genuinely geeky but sweet girl with an anime obsession who wore glasses, and baggy clothes and was madeover into an incredibly <em>gorgeous</em> girl with a great body who proceeded to win second place in her high school beauty pageant.
</li><li> Annie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> seems to be undergoing an on-going process of this trope; it's suggested in her backstory that, as well as being a rather neurotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> she had problems with weight and acne which she's only overcome relatively recently, which coupled with her various neuroses and self-esteem issues mean that she doesn't fully realize exactly how attractive she really is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> S5:E23, Steve's Aunt Oona from Altoona comes for a visit. She appears just as awkward and nerdy as Steve himself. Harriet takes pity on her and gives her a makeover, which reveals her to be as beautiful as Donna Summer. Because she <em>is</em> Donna Summer.

However, other than the Love Interest, no one seems to notice.
<ul><li> It is then subverted: Elphaba rushes from the room in tears, shows up the next day in a flirtier wardrobe, and earning everyone's notice <em>because</em> they know exactly how her roommate "fixed" her. Elphaba's future love interest then tells her that she really doesn't have to change herself, she's just fine. She never follows Glinda's makeover tips again, seeing as the costume department is too busy slowly transforming her into the Wicked Witch of the West.
</li><li> Then in Act II,
<div class="indent"><strong>Elphaba:</strong> I just wish... <br/><strong>Fiyero:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Elphaba:</strong> I wish I could be beautiful... for you. <br/><strong>Fiyero:</strong> Elphaba... <br/><strong>Elphaba:</strong> Don't tell me that I am, you don't need to lie to me. <br/><strong>Fiyero:</strong> It's not lying!

Tracy Turnblad is short and overweight and her make-over can only do so much. Then again, she became popular before the make-over, which is more of a perk of already being popular, by winning the crowd over due to her upbeat attitude and dance ability rather than looks. The love interest, Link Larkin, likes her because she makes him grow as a person, and because he's narcissistic enough to be beautiful enough for both of them. Tracy's mother, Edna Turnblad, is traditionally played by a man, compounding the problems. Her husband, however, doesn't even notice the make-over, as he is in love with her no matter what (and he's as thick as a 1960's bomb shelter door when it comes to noticing things).
<ul><li> There were casting calls for a local production of the play in Argentina. Even thought the ad for the casting calls clearly demanded overweight teenagers for the role of Tracy, some skinny/normal girls ignored this and auditioned for the role anyway.
</li><li> With regards to Edna, in her case it's really a "Fabulous All Along" moment.

<div class="indent"> Harlan had a brief flash of déjà vu, looking at Delta Spike. Then he realized that she was the picture of a Hollywood Girl Scientist, the one whos supposed to be a drab little geek, but you know that the second that she takes off her glasses and lets her hair down, shes absolutely gorgeous. Delta Spike had long glossy black hair that was tied up in a style that really didnt suit her. She wore a pair of thick clunky-looking black frame glasses that couldnt have done a better job of disguising her classic features if shed designed them for just that task. Still, she smiled prettily enough.

<ul><li> Double Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> parody episode, where Phyllis, a girl interested in Steve, lets down her hair and takes off her glasses to reveal... an unkempt afro and beady eyes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> in that he still finds her attractive. Possibly moreso.
</li><li> Subverted in an episode featuring a Kathy and Hoda style morning show, only drunker and crueler. They take a dowdy woman and when she comes out after the makeover, looking better, they say "Oh, we've got another one!". They then display a sign saying "Unsalvageable" and pull a cord dropping her into a trapdoor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">The New Batman Adventures</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheNewBatmanAdventuresE13MeanSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheNewBatmanAdventuresE13MeanSeasons">"Mean Seasons"</a> plays it straight as a twist. A villain going by the name "Calendar Girl" kidnaps various fashion and cosmetics bigwigs in order to exact her revenge from them. The villain wears a metal mask that conceals her face completely and constantly fumes about how the industry has ruined her, especially her beautiful face. At the end of the episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is revealed that she is flawlessly beautiful, but is so distraught by her perceived flaws that she believes herself to be immeasurably hideous.</span>
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a>,</em> the last two episodes just sort of mocked this trope. Joan is already quite good-looking, and as Abe tries to find her "hidden beauty" he just insults her unintentionally.
</li><li> Subverted repeatedly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>. She <em>is</em> pretty, but has chosen to not play it up because she thinks doing so would be vain. Averted outright at least once though, when Daria was getting fitted for a wedding dress and the seamstress said her body had no curves, making it impossible to fit the dress right. And the dress hung off her like a smock for the rest of the episode.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a>,</em> Clara's retarded cousin "Bleh," who normally wore confining clothes and a protective helmet, turns out to be more than "not just hot— but <em>retarded</em> hot" because of her slack jaw and dual lazy-eyes making her look impossibly sexy for a "normal" girl.
</li><li> A straight (if over-the-top) example occurs in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em> in which Cornfed meets a secretary who morphs into a supermodel when she undoes her hair/takes off her glasses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> plays this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Meg</a>, who goes from a girl who's so ugly that people commit suicide by burning themselves to death rather than look at her to a very attractive woman. Meg eventually abandons it after becoming conceited, being humiliated on national television, and deciding that it is too hard to maintain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, gargoyles have differing views of beauty compared to humans.

At the end of the season two episode "Wild Cards" she sits at the bedside of an injured Green Lantern in the Watchtower. The two have been building a romance for the past two years. Green Lantern finally takes off her mask and she's revealed to be <a class="urllink" href="http://chaplainandrews.files.wordpress.com/2006/08/temp_jl_hawkgirl_unmasked.jpg">absolutely gorgeous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> with beautiful green eyes.
<ul><li> In an episode of <em>Unlimited</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a> jokingly declares <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a> (Vic Sage, the male one) to be the ugliest guy ever to wear a featureless mask all the time. Even after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a>, she still hadn't seen his face. In part of the season finale, Q is beaten to within an inch of his life. He lets her remove his mask to kiss him, and he remarks that she was right on her joke. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/JusticeLeague">She still finds him attractive.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> A scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a> On the Rocks</em>: Wilma walks into the bedroom with her hair down and in skimpy clothing, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexophone">Sexophone</a> accompaniment. Fred at first seems to react according to the trope, but it turns out that Wilma was blocking his view of the TV.
</li><li> Sheldon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a></em> is a scrawny, weak Nerd, who walks with a hunch and has a Jerry Lewis-esque voice...until he takes off his glasses and we find he is incredibly muscular with a stronger and more masculine voice. It turns out that his glasses are so heavy they act as weights and keep his from walking upright. Subverted when Todd tries to see if Sheldon's sister is the same, only to walk away trembling when he finds out that she's not.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> episode "Mystery Solvers Club State Finals", the principal of the school (where the finals are held) looks very professional and...well, not <strong>un</strong>attractive. Yet it's not until she saves a life from drowning that she feels "alive!" She tosses off her glasses, releases her flowing hair from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun">bun-captivity</a>, and possibly the top button on her coat becomes undone, becoming the kind of school official whose office a teenaged boy wouldn't mind being sent.
</li><li> Another straight if over-the-top example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> where Lisa is inspired to take dancing lessons. She and Marge are watching a film where the male protagonist chooses a woman named "Lisabella" to be his dance partner. She initially looks very bookish but on removing her glasses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingHerHairDown">Letting Her Hair Down</a> and having the top buttons of her blouse pop off is revealed to be stunning.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "The List". Kyle convinces one of the ugly girls to take off her coke bottle eye-magnifying glasses. Turns out that her eyes are tiny and practically on the sides of her head.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Let's just... put those back on.
</div></li><li> Gwen Stacy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. Seriously, she went from one of the cast's dowdiest female members to flat out gorgeous. Mary Jane was too kind. Though because of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">she just looked like a blonde version of MJ</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdsAreSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdsAreSexy">many of the fans preferred how she looked</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, who in her "Kara Kent" identity wears a wig and glasses, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>.
</li><li> Starfire is an odd example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Transformation". She's beautiful to begin with, but the change she undergoes in the episode (which is similar to Tameranian puberty, but more extreme in her case) turns her ugly - temporarily. When it's over, she's not only beautiful again, she's <em>far</em> more powerful, as if the short "ugly period" was needed to strengthen her powers.
</li><li> Beautifully averted in the episode, "Beauty and the Wildebeest", of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimonAndPumbaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimonAndPumbaa">Timon &amp; Pumbaa</a></em> where Rafiki helps an ugly wildebeest improve his looks and manners so that he can romance a beautiful gazelle that he has a crush for. In the end the gazelle, touched when the wildebeest is willing to reveal his hideous visage to scare off a rival at her birthday party, removes her makeup and reveals herself to be just as ugly as he is and they both share a kiss before the end credits.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. The right haircut, dress sense and accessorising can <em>dramatically</em> change one's appearance. For some people, it can be as simple as wearing shirts that fit, or styling their hair differently. In other cases, someone who has for years been considered homely-looking can get a flattering haircut, change up their fashion sense to suit their build, stop (or start!) wearing glasses or just change the frames, and suddenly find themselves with a lot more romantic attention.
</li><li> Can cross over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a> when picking a new look in the course of growing up results in this. When they're young, most people tend to follow passing trends exactly, or allow other people to make choices for them (parents choosing clothes, friends "suggesting" certain things, etc.) However, after a few years, and a hefty amount of trial and error, most people tend to find what works specifically for them. For women, it's finding what products work with your complexion, and what hairstyle (long, short, lighter, darker, etc.) complements their face, while men tend to find out that some faces look wrong with facial hair, and others look wrong WITHOUT it. Alongside the ending of puberty, which makes everyone's face and body go haywire during high school, and a very awkward teenager can become a very attractive 20-something.
</li><li> Male example: a regular feature of the reality show "Beauty and the Geek" was a mid-season makeover for all of the remaining geeks. It was always quite surprising how well some of them turned out. In particular, Wes from Season 2 was transformed from a mop-headed nerd into a shocking handsome man with just a haircut, contacts, and a new set of clothes. One of the show's dirty little secrets was that they specifically cast "geeks" who they knew would clean up well - you'll notice you never saw any who weighed 300 pounds or had terrible acne - sometimes the geeks were even "uglied up" so that their "makeovers" just returned them to the way they usually looked. At least one, for example, was told in his "makeover" to ditch his thick-framed glasses and switch to contact lenses; thing is, the guy only ever wore contacts in real life before going on the show. Since plenty of the applicants were just regular guys trying to seem as geeky as they could to get on TV, it wasn't hard to find presentable ones.
</li><li> The best-looking people tend to have a lot of help (via personal trainers, salons, fashion-consultants etc), while those with a poor self-image can neglect or even sabotage their appearance so it's conceivable that some people can undergo quite a change; likewise, illness typically harms one's appearance, so improving health can likewise make a substantial difference. And vice-versa.
</li><li> A Daily Mail writer willfully underwent a personal <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2101789/TOWIE-look-Transforming-Essex-Girl-involves-8-hours-torture-1-200.html">makeover<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to look more like the women of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOnlyWayIsEssex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOnlyWayIsEssex">The Only Way Is Essex</a></em>, the British equivalent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore">Jersey Shore</a></em>. Final tally: 8 hours, 1,200 pounds, and this comment from the writer herself: "I look like a Quality Street. And yet, as I peer at the women tottering around me in Loughton, I seem to fit right in."
</li><li> Many of the young actors in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies started out as average and geeky looking as befit their characters and became very attractive as they grew up. The most noteworthy examples are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a> (Hermione Granger) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewLewis">Matthew Lewis</a> (Neville Longbottom). Matt Lewis' transformation was so drastic that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb">to Neville Longbottom</a>" has become a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSpeak">Fan Speak</a> verb amongst Potterheads, meaning "to have puberty do you <em>all</em> sorts of favours".
</li><li> In the 1990s during the Clinton administration, First Daughter Chelsea Clinton (a mere pre-teen when her father was elected) was often the subject of downright cruel mocking of her looks. However, as Chelsea grew into adulthood, the mocking vanished.
</li><li> It's not uncommon for this to happen to kids that enlist in the military after graduating High School. Many males start out meek looking, and not much to look at compared to the jocks that they'd have to compete with for female attention. A few months, and the addition of the Dress Uniform and the women that would've normally scoffed them off suddenly forget the jocks even exist. Ironically, this was also one of the contributing factors for the baby boom right after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Many American GIs left for Europe or the Pacific without a girl back home, but after the war was over, they certainly didn't have many issues finding a woman to settle down with... even if they weren't a US Citizen.
</li><li> Japanese professional shogi player Manao Kagawa used to be look tomboyish in her younger years, with her short hair, chubby build and eyeglasses. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.goodtimes.my/2017/12/22/japanese-shogi-player-manao-kagawa-acted-little-boy-grown-appearance-changed-completely-netizens-said-star-4/">A few years later, and she cleaned up so well she looks like a completely different person.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></li></ul></div>
