<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frieza pointed out several flaws of his enemies:
<ul><li> When Goku calls out Frieza on his wanton cruelty and puts him off for killing the Saiyans and Namekians, Frieza points out that the Saiyan race was no better than he was, which is unfortunately true: the Saiyans <em>were</em> savage space pirates, and even if they were in Frieza's employ, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">they still loved their jobs and took great pride in it</a>.
</li><li> Frieza repeatedly tells Goku that he is too merciful and that he has become overconfident, dropping his guard too soon. While undeniably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocritical</a> sentiment as far as overconfidence goes, he isn't wrong: Goku's inclination towards mercy has nearly gotten him killed on several occasions, and he <em>has</em> dropped his guard around Frieza several times, nearly dying for it <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When the Universe 9 assassins come to kill him, Frieza naturally starts dropping them like flies. When Goku tells him not to do it, Frieza responds that it doesn't really matter if they die by his hand now or when their universe will be erased after the tournament (which Goku, who has come to recruit him to participate, <em>will</em> make happen by winning, whether he wants to or not). Unlike the above instances, Goku doesn't have <em>any</em> arguments to refute Frieza's claim.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> While Zamasu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> god-student of Supreme Kai Gowasu of Universe 10 has become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Super's</em> Future Trunks Saga and went on to destroy all mortals considering all of them evil and stupid, his overall view on them is not entirely unfounded. Mortals do misuse the knowledge of the gods and have committed several atrocities: Frieza and the Saiyans were cold-hearted planet brokers who regularly committed genocide for profit; Dr. Gero used his great mind to create mass-murdering androids, one of whom (Cell) literally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">ate</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">people</a>, all to settle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">a petty grudge</a> with Goku; and Bibidi and Babidi unleashed Majin Buu on Universe 7 and caused the deaths of nearly all of the Supreme Kais and killed billions of people. There's also Bulma, who despite knowing that time travel can bring really great disasters and that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTaboo">forbidden by the gods</a>, <em>still went on to create a time machine</em> in the episode <em>immediately</em> preceding Zamasu's defeat. Zamasu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>, however, is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">inability</a> to see that not all mortals are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">evil by nature</a>.
<ul><li> His assessment of the Babarians proves sound; Gowasu brought him there to demonstrate that mortals weren't inherently evil and capable of maturation, yet even after a thousand years, there was no moral growth to observe in the species.
</li><li> He also has a point about the gods' inaction against evil mortals. It's explicitly pointed out that the reason Universe 7 has such a low mortal level is because the gods don't help mortals as much as they should. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> manga even points out that Beerus <em>should</em> have dealt with Majin Buu prior to Buu killing all but one of the Supreme Kais and leaving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained">Incompletely Trained</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">to rule alone</a>, but he was asleep at the time. He also allowed Frieza to run rampant and encouraged him by approving the Saiyan genocide.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> has this with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren Yeager</span>. The villain has seen just how bad the treatment of the Eldrians has gone — those living on the island are treated as perpetually-sinning devils incarnate and are planned to be exterminated through extreme measures, while those living elsewhere are treated as second-class citizens, barricaded into 'their' section of a city, get indoctrinated into believing a skewed view of history that makes them believe themselves part of those sinners, and their powers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of turning into Titans</span> are used for the government's benefit — and realizes that talking is no longer an option. The mindset of the Eldrians being evil is so deeply ingrained into the whole <em>world</em> that there is no way to peacefully resolve things, so they decide to use the Rumbling to kill everyone not on the island. Without having anyone on the outside wanting the island Eldrians dead, they can finally live in peace from the world and free of Titans. Even some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">in-universe</a> characters agree that the villain's method is extreme, but it would work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> has this with Kaito Tenjo. He believes the Numbers' cards are evil, and from what has been seen, the Numbers can easily make the good bad (Ukyo, Fuya to a lesser extent) and the bad worse, (Jin, Rikuo, Kaio). Also, his claim that the Numbers want to destroy the world seems plausible, seeing the evil from Black Mist who was able to capture Astral and control Yuma's body against his will. The only issue with him capturing Numbers is that he takes the soul of the person who possessed it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Daimon calls out Kaiba on the way he used and abused both The Big Five, and his own brother, Mokuba, during his coup against his adoptave father Gozaburo. While Daimons a bastard, and in no position to criticize, he's not wrong when he points out how unacceptable Kaiba's behaviour was.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em>, maybe he doesn't exactly earn the title of "villain" (he's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> than he is villain), but when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yamamoto grabs Hinako in the final chapter, setting himself up pretty nicely as one more in a long line of abusive bastards</span>, he makes her realise that, without intending to, understandable though her reaction was, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she has truly hurt the feelings of some of the guys in her class, most of whom wouldn't even dream of harming her the way her rapist did.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Shogo Makishima</a> may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopathic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who instructs would-be criminals how to commit their crimes, but he is spot-on in his criticisms of the society in which he lives, and especially of the sybil system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>:

<div class="indent"><strong>Gene:</strong> <em>(pissed)</em> Don't gimme that! I know it was you!

The Giha village chief is right that living underground keeps them safe, the Adai village chief is right that they don't have enough food to feed more people so his methods keep the the village as a whole alive, Lordgenome is right that suppressing humanity keeps them safe from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Anti-Spirals</span>, and they're completely justified in their goals because otherwise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the universe is at risk</span>.

</li><li> Kagatane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet">Black Bullet</a></em> is your typical masked man ranting on and on about the government and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>. Though when you see the overall treatment towards little girls who risk their lives to save their butts every waking moment of their life, which includes lynch mobs, school bombings, and treating them as something less than human, you begin to wonder why the protagonists don't start thinking like him.

During the fight, Stain notes that Iida is obsessed with a selfish desire for revenge but is completely indifferent to helping his newest victim, which means that Iida is not a true hero at all. When faced with the contrast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Midoriya and Todoroki</a> showing up to selflessly help him, Iida has to admit to himself that Stain was right.

<ul><li> Stain's whole motive is his hate for heroes who are only in the business for their own popularity and fame rather than to actually help people. While everyone agrees that his methods (killing everyone who doesn't live up to his outrageously high standards) are awful, it is acknowledged in-universe that his complaint isn't entirely baseless. There are a number of heroes who are far more concerned with winning accolades for themselves than actually being helpful. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Todoroki,</a> of all people, knows the consequences of such personal gain via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">his father, Endeavor,</a> who Stain openly calls out upon encountering as the <em>worst</em> of the "fakes".
</li></ul></li><li> The League of Villains as a whole intend to call out the Pro World for their hypocrisies and failings, and they aren't wrong that the Pro system is hugely flawed. Shigaraki Tomura, in particular, has an exceedingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> that could have been avoided if somebody had stepped in to save him - and All Might damn near has a mental breakdown when he finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's Nana Shimura's grandson. When she gave her child, Kotaro, up for adoption after her husband's death, ostensibly for her child's safety, Kotaro grew up bitter over being abandoned, and proceeded to abuse his younger son, Tenko. Then after Tenko accidentally killed his family with his newly awakened quirk and was reduced to living on the streets, nobody would help him because they all felt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">that was a hero's job and not theirs</a>, leaving him an easy target for All For One. It's no wonder he feels the hero system is broken.</span>
</li><li> Dabi gets a turn when he sneers at UA for being "pathetic" when they decide to bring <em>sixteen-year-olds</em> to the frontlines of the hero vs villain conflict (with Midnight even telling a terrified-looking Kaminari he "knew what he signed up for"). Of course, Dabi has no qualms fighting teenagers himself, but he isn't doing it and claiming to be a hero.

Sadly, he's proven right when SAO is cleared.
</li><li> Sugou Nobuyuki is a total bastard, but he makes a valid point when he remarks to Asuna that Kayaba's FullDive technology had far more potential and uses than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">simply making a video game</a>, and that Kayaba was foolish to not want more out of it. Indeed, Kayaba's tech has found other uses beyond game development, most notably with the Medicuboid and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Soul Translator</span>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2et1k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2et1k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2et1k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, Sugou's argument is somewhat undermined when the ending of the Mother's Rosario arc reveals that Kayaba was actually the original designer of the Medicuboid, meaning he <em>did</em> in fact see the potential in his invention.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Sugou</strong>: Mr. Kayaba was a genius, but he was also a fool. All he wanted to use his technology for was his game. He couldn't see the potential in it. But <em>I</em> did.

He's a mass murderer who constantly lies to everyone who cares about him. But Light put an end to all wars and reduced global crime by 70%. Nobody contradicts him when he says this. In fact, a good part of his in-universe support derives from this.
</li><li> Embryo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em> is a raging, narcissistic, psychopathic, hypocritical bastard and on top of that a super creepy and disturbing pervert. He wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestartTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestartTheWorld">Restart the World</a> because in his eyes, humanity has grown corrupt and decadent, even if he might have had a hand in making it that way. Throughout the series, we witness with our own eyes how this has taken effect: Humanity became drunk on using Mana, becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Entitled Bastards</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racists</a>, and Norma are discriminated against just because, with only a few even bothering to develop beyond their prejudice-filled mindset (such as Momoka). It <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsBeyondSaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsBeyondSaving">rotten to the core</a>, the same thought that the heroine Ange also has, and the Mana users make up the majority of the world population. Even if Embryo was the one who suggested such a racism system in the first place to avoid war, it's plausible to say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">he realized that such a system was a mistake if it created such rampant decadence</a> and there's no other option to fix this except to restart and think of a new one. If Embryo wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist">trying to please his raging hormones or trying to play God and stroke his ego more</a> (or not considering the Norma and predecessors to be just collateral damage), he might've gotten his point across instead of getting every one of the Normas and the predecessors to oppose and kill him.

Her reasoning is that since Imanity, which can't see or use magic, is declining due to being unable to win the games that serve as an alternative to warfare in Disboard, they need the help of the Elves in order to survive. While Sora is disgusted with Kurami's lack of faith in Imanity, he believes that an Imanity-Elf alliance does have potential merit, and after defeating her and becoming co-rulers of Imanity alongside his adopted sister Shiro, sets out to unite all the races under one banner.

Yoichi's statement is meant to distract Enchu while Muhyo prepares to strike, but considering that he'd investigate what led to Enchu's accomplice's betrayal of the MLS, he seems to mean it.

Muhyo and Roji ultimately lose to Goryo and Ebisu in the ensuing competition, and Muhyo puts Roji on leave to find out what he needs to do to improve himself. In fact, Ebisu, Goryo's rather unpleasant assistant, helps give Roji some of the advice he needs.

Utena never really tried to progress her relationship past their initial impressions of each other, contently played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a> role despite the inherent imbalance of that relationship, and never realized that Anthy was deeply miserable and in suffering for their entire time together. All that, along with the fact that Utena's stated goal for almost the entire series was simply to be a prince, suggests that Utena's relationship with Anthy was indeed shallow and fueled by a desire to play out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect">The Dulcinea Effect</a> rather than genuine concern. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Akio is right, because the Rose Bride's prison is self-inflicted: Utena's only been focusing on beating him, which won't free Anthy because it won't make Anthy want freedom. Unfortunately for Akio, this is what allows Utena to figure out the truth about Anthy and show her that she can be free.</span>

He brings up the idea of going to that exact moment and preventing the High Ones from being sent into the past and driven from their home, and preempt centuries of struggle and suffering on their part. When Cutter objects, Rayek makes a point: the presence of elves has always negatively affected the World of Two Moons (going back to the first volume, when a human tribe caused a forest fire to drive the Wolfriders out), but they're literally <em>aliens</em>; the world had its own path before they arrived by accident, and it has a right to its own destiny.

His insults to Optimus about using titles (like Prime) to put oneself above the others is detrimental to the new peace (which ol' Screamer's obviously being a hypocrite about since his whole Chosen One schtick puts him above others), which Optimus agrees with. Then there's Starscream's justification about using Superion, since Optimus has Devastator, a dangerous powerful monster that Optimus really cannot control. When Devastator does end up a problem, Starscream forcibly conscripts Six Autobots and turns them into a Combiner, and he's completely right in doing so. Devastator is a damaging machine of destruction who took down the only Combiner on their side, but with two, they defeat Devastator and save everyone. Starscream looks the hero, and he has two powerful war machines behind him, even if their true loyalties are to the Autobots.

But once arrested, Norman (and the other villains SHIELD takes into custody after Peter defeats them) are not provided with legal counsel, representation, or are even allowed any form of contact with the outside world. Nick Fury flat-out says he has no problem detaining them in a SHIELD prison facility indefinitely unless they agree to work for him. Osborn naturally points out that whether they altered their DNA or not, they still have human rights (Fury claims otherwise) and that holding them without trial or even contact with the outside world is highly illegal. All good points, though the moral high ground is lost when coming from Osborn, who inevitably goes on a killing spree every single time he escapes custody. The one time he escaped and used the chance to make a media shitstorm by telling everyone he was illegally detained, it was derailed when he flew into a homicidal rage and burned his own attorney to death.

Some examples are: 1) He immediately recognizes that Batman is the real reason why organized crime is threatened in Gotham and points this out to the mob, which causes the mob to hire the Joker when they realize he was right, giving the Joker access to Gotham's underworld. 2) He exploits the fact that Batman really is an unlawful vigilante by promising to kill people until Batman unmasks, turning the city and the cops against Batman. 3) He convinces Harvey Dent to become Two-Face by telling Dent that the so-called justice system that he supports is filled with corrupt people who constantly tolerate corruption and profit from crime, which is true since Jim Gordon is forced to work with suspect cops in order to have enough men to do his job. 4) He constantly claims that people are complacent and corruptible and backs up his beliefs by putting people in a position where they have to choose to obey the law and their principles, or lose something they dearly love (only Batman consistently demonstrates his incorruptibility).

After the Paris Peace Accord incident, he then points out that the participants include a man who can direct metal (and is the prime suspect/convicted prisoner in the death of a sitting U.S. President), another who believes that mutants will drive humanity into extinction, and a third who can shapeshift into anyone and order a nuclear strike if she felt like it. It doesn't justify his genocidal tendencies towards mutants, but these are some very real fears.

That being said, many times they bring up the valid point that the Olympians themselves can be unbelievably petty and cruel, even to those that don't deserve it, and that they can often be inattentive or uncaring to the mortals that need and look up to them. One of the major reasons the bad guys in the first series had an army of demigods on their side in the first place was due to their feelings of abandonment, believing themselves to be forsaken not just by the gods, but by their own <em>parents</em>.

<ul><li> During a heated exchange when Catelyn Stark tries to insult Jaime Lannister by calling him 'Kingslayer' and dishonourable, Jaime rightly points out that the king in question was an insane monster (he could have equally pointed out that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon also betrayed the king by rebelling against him in the first place). Then Jaime points out that Ned Stark (Catelyn's husband), while honourable, was not without his flaws either and Catelyn herself hardly fulfills the ideals of "family, duty, honor" either, since she had always resented her husband's illegitimate son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Jon Snow</a>, an innocent child, for something that was not Jon's fault.

For instance, when Sansa gets upset with him for being a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, he points out that he's the only one who could protect her from his boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">King Joffrey Baratheon</a>, mostly thanks to his reputation. He also mocks the notion of "knights" as being romantic and idealized, viewing them somewhat correctly as hired killers, and he is better than most of them because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt">at least acknowledges what he is</a> and doesn't indulge in wanton sadism.
</li><li> Tywin is absolutely correct about Joffrey neither being a wise or a good king.
</li><li> Speaking of, in a rare moment of actual brilliance, there's Joffrey's assessment of the feudal system Westeros runs on. A king is completely dependent on his subordinates, and his subordinates rely on their bannermen, which makes handling a continent the size of Westeros very difficult. Also that many of these bannermen have some really big armies and can really tip the scales if they aren't appeased in every possible way. That's how delicate the balance of power really is.
</li><li> In Season 6, Euron Greyjoy returns to the Iron Island in order to claim the throne. When Yara accuses him of murdering her father, Euron brazenly admits he did it and comments that Balon was a terrible king that nobody wanted, who lead the Iron Islands into two wars they had no hope of winning and brought his people to near-ruin, all because of his personal ambition and yet no strategy or plan to back it up. He's right on all counts and his speech is enough to turn the majority of the Iron Islanders against Yara and Theon.
<ul><li> Also, the Ironborn are a culture of raiders. Their motto is "We Do Not Sow," because they take what others have rather than grow their own crops or build their own palaces. Euron killing Balon to claim the throne actually shows him far more fitting a ruler than Theon and Yara, who based their claims based on appeals to honor.
</li></ul></li><li> In Season 7, Cersei Lannister is able to rally her allies against Daenerys Targaryen due to her bringing a massive Dothraki horde to Westeros. While Cersei is a highly corrupt despot whose aim is to remain in power by any means necessary, the fear and hate of the Dothraki is justified: up until Daenerys took control of them, they were a savage and extremely misogynistic barbarians (one Dothraki widow reminisced how her husband brutalized her after she gave birth to a daughter - and <em>she was 12 at the time!</em>). Even though Daenerys has noble intentions to liberate Westeros from the Lannister's iron grip, the reputation of her own forces is far more feared than that of the Ironborn, the local Westerosi raiders.

Hardy's lame excuses (like that he's just "living in the moment" or that he's not perfect), combined with the fact that he never admitted fault for his past, caused more than a few fans to turn against the supposed face. Of course, this didn't at all justify Punk's cheating or using cowardly sneak attacks.
<ul><li> Punk tends to get this a lot. His point toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus">The Nexus</a> feud that he's not as high on morals as he claims can be argued to be true. John Cena's done some pretty awful things and was saved from being booed by being a face. Of course Punk, being a heel, was booed for pointing this out.
</li><li> Further down the road, he was the heel in a feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, but it was then-heel Orton who attacked then face-Punk years ago when he was champion, and punted him in the head, forcing him to forfeit the title via injury.

Where this got particularly dark was when Orton took to using the same punting move on members of Punk's Nexus group, eventually putting everyone in the group except Punk himself on a bus. When you look at it, Punk is seeking revenge for something that a person would be extremely justified in being angry about, but he's the villain, when Orton himself has barely changed from his vicious, psycho heel persona, but the crowd cheers him anyway.

Read between the lines of the typical heel self-aggrandizing and it was pretty sound. She felt WWE women's wrestling wasn't given any respect by fans or the WWE corporation despite busting her butt to bring up diva's wrestling to the level it was at the time.

Whilst describing the rest of the divas as "perky bimbos" may be going a little far, consider that the two of them have in fact wrestled from an early age and yet often lose to former models who never wrestled before joining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> and it can be a little hard to see them as outright heels.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MuhammadHassan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MuhammadHassan">Muhammad Hassan</a> had spent his entire career in the WWE pointing out the prejudice and racism he has to go through as an Arab-American. When you hear fans chanting "USA" at him despite being billed from <em>Detroit, Michigan</em>, you know he has a valid point. And let's not talk about his appearance in the Royal Rumble match (where every wrestler in the ring, heel or face, teamed up to eject him). What drove home his point is that during his feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, he had several masked assailants attack Taker. <em>The New York Post's</em> Don Kaplan ran a story headlined with "Undertaker Attacked By Arabs." Hassan brought up the very valid point of "How did they <em>know</em> they were Arab if they were wearing masks?" (Answer: because they appeared after Hassan apparently "prayed" them into existence, and as his theme song played.) Unfortunately, even that wasn't enough to save his character - UPN essentially forced WWE to never show him on Smackdown again when the terrorism angle coincided with the 2005 London bombings, and they saw no other choice but to have Undertaker essentially kill him off in their scheduled match at the next pay-per-view. Sad thing is, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> Arab; in real life Mark Copani was descended from Italian Americans, so it's really just because people see dark skin and assume everything they hear that is negative to be true.

He was supposed to come off as jealous (since he failed to win his own tribute match to his uncle), but considering that Eddie's death has been used as Rey's motivation even <em>before</em> his Road to WrestleMania, some fans agreed with him to the point where <em>he</em> was considered to be the true face in all of this (others just thought it was a dumb angle, considering Rey <em>should</em> be able to coast on his own family name).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fortune">The Fourtune</a>/EV 2.0 feud in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> seemed to be based around the fact that Fourtune was pissed they had to make room in the spotlight for all the old ECW guys, most of whom they feel can't wrestle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> stated that until [the ECW guys] survive a plane crash like he did, they can't tell him shit about being "hardcore". Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> feels he's helped make TNA what it is through his duty to the company, calling TNA "The House That AJ Styles Built" and declaring ECW has no right to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">push him and the other originals out of the spotlight</a>. They both have a point. What sends this into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> territory is that the ECW/EV2.0 guys were famously loyal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a> because they always came first to him (other guys would come in but he never put them over at the expense of his originals). The audience was supposed to boo Fourtune (the original TNA guys, for the most part) because they're complaining EV2.0 (the invaders) are taking over their show, when the invaders' original company (ECW) achieved its success because the original ECW manager was loyal to his originals and never pushed them aside. Furthermore, the ECW guys are supposed to be faces, but they're doing something that the original ECW despised (pushing aside original talent in favor of other, more famous people).
</li><li> The way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> was treated after <em>Over the Limit</em> was particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a>, not the least because it happened on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">his very last night with WWE</a>. He and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> competed for the WWE Championship in an "I Quit" match that culminated with Batista giving up after Cena threatened to give him the Attitude Adjustment off the top of a car. Cena smiled — and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">went through with it anyway</a>, nearly killing him! The next night on <em>Raw</em>, Batista showed up (in a wheelchair) to protest Cena's cowardly attack on him and to threaten to bring a lawsuit against WWE, claiming them responsible for nearly ending his career. <em>Raw</em> General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> then appeared and told Batista that he would be granted another chance at the WWE Championship if he could win a qualifying match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> to be held immediately. When Batista pointed out that he couldn't even <em>walk</em>, Hart rather rudely stated that Batista therefore forfeited. Batista went ballistic and screamed at everyone, announcing that he was quitting WWE for being treated so unfairly — and <em>every single person in the arena booed him</em>, like they would any other crybaby heel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> aside, it was a really disrespectful send-off for a wrestler who, for the past five years, had been second only to Cena in popularity.
<ul><li> Bret Hart's ascension to General Manager was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> attempting to pull this on him. After Bret dished him a particularly nasty beatdown over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">Montreal Screwjob</a>, Vince decided to promote him to GM, showing him that being in charge means being the bad guy and making decisions not everyone will like for the sake of the company. He gets into a disagreement with his family after making such a decision over a match, though Vince quickly seizes the moment and fires him afterwards, ensuring Bret still looks unfairly treated.

While Triple H was a heel at the time and could be dismissed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> trying to justify himself betraying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">DX</a>, after thinking about <em>Chyna</em> betraying Triple H for the Corporation and how he was all alone with none of the other DX members coming to his aid, it's no surprise that Triple H decided to sell out his buddies in DX.

While the point Cole made <em>was</em> slightly valid, it really <em>wasn't</em> Lawler's place to interrupt a new champion's victory celebration, but The Miz is a frankly pathetic heel who more or less cheated to win his title and most faces would have done the same, there was a point in that Lawler technically did screw himself out of the win. While yes, Cole did pull him off the ladder and temporarily stop him from winning, Lawler berated and then assaulted Cole on this for at least a full minute. If Lawler had simply given Cole a well-deserved punch in the mouth and gone back to his business, Lawler would have been champion. Although it was still fun to see Michael Cole get beaten down.

Sting tried to punish Roode for his outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">cheating tactics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> tendencies - including taking advantage of injured ex-partners and practically shooting them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Dixie Carter</a> as a shield and spitting in her face, among other assorted tactics - by making life hard for him as the champion. However, Sting in the process took to forcing Roode into repeat title defenses on <em>Impact</em> after certain pay-per-views as well as physically involved himself in world title matters. Roode is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfish traitor</a> with no redeemable social qualities whatsoever, but he's got a point about Sting's zeal for screwing with him to get a more virtuous champion — he's later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">exploited that to recreate an old Bret Hart title defense</a>. Sting would still later realize that Roode was right and he would never end Roode's reign this way, turning over power back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> because it just wasn't working and coming back later as an active wrestler again.

Notably in a cage match, Jeff cost them the titles by being at the top of the cage, and instead of escaping (and winning the match), he chose to jump off and ended up getting pinned. Matt had a point, didn't he?

Bobby took offense to this but not only was it true, MVP also did everything in his power to keep Lashley healthy even after he was healthy enough to wrestle again, not demanding he get his shot until Lashley lost the belt. Nonetheless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> and Bobby Roode tried to milk this for all they could to turn Lashley and MVP against each other.

Considering that just the prior week, Cena told Rusev he had the right to free speech, assaulted Rusev when Rusev later exercised that right, and then put a barely conscious Rusev in the STF until Rusev's crying girlfriend agreed to give Cena what he wanted, Rusev had a point in calling Cena an arrogant dick.

</li><li> Several of the Primarchs who betrayed the Emperor during the Horus Heresy had legitimate reasons to be pissed off at the Emperor: Angron, the savage berserker, who was whisked away to serve as a weapon in another's war while the people he cared about were left to die; Perturabo, the coldly calculating besieger who was willing to sacrifice any number of warriors for victory, who spent a century and a half trudging through the endless hell of sieges while all the other Legions got the glory and looked down on him; and Lorgar, the high priest of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a>, who had his genuine commitment treated with brutal disdain by the one he revered above all, in a rebuke that left a city in ruins and its population dead.

And given that he lost Doma because he didn't kill Hien, and lost Ala Mhigo because he was reliant on Doman conscripts who had no reason to be loyal once Doma was freed, under Zenos's rule the Empire would have torn itself apart within the month.</span>

<div class="indent">"Some people ask why XANA immediately tried to kill Jeremie in this episode, given that Jeremie really isn't a threat. I think I figured out why XANA tries to exterminate humanity. When XANA was first created, the very first person he met was Franz Hopper, a man so crazy that even Aelita pointed it out at one point. The next person he met was Aelita. Since XANA has at least a peripheral understanding of the outside world, he can sense what's going on in the factory. That means that he can sense the horrors of French engineering. He can also sense the school, which means that he can sense the amazing incompetence of a school that hired Jim, hired a man as crazy as Franz Hopper, keeps open containers of toxic waste near children, and is run by a man so spineless that Sissi can manipulate him. He can also sense the hospital, and the horrors of the french mental healthcare system. Based on all these things at once, my guess is that XANA encountered all of these horrors of humanity, and it's first reaction to a species that consistently produced such horrible things was, "AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT WITH FIRE! actually, SCREW FIRE, KILL IT WITH FIRE, ORBITAL BOMBARDMENT, DEATH LASERS, CAPTAIN JANEWAY'S CYBERNETIC SPIDERS, ARMIES OF ROBOTS, THE POWER OF STEPHEN KING NOVELS, WEATHER, ELECTRIC TAR, AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES TO MIND!" XANA is not evil. It's just trying to save itself and all other species from the horrors of humanity. Given that the main and secondary cast includes Yumi, an implied domestic abuser; Ulrich, a disturbed stalker; Jim, a person who smiles at the thought of rubbing himself with poop; Jeremie, a necrophile; Aelita, a pedophile; Odd, a manwhore moron; and other horrors, I kind of have to side with XANA on this one."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>: One of the recurring themes of the series, with Toph directly stating in the final season that every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> started off with good ideas (equality, spirituality, freedom, unity) but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">went too far with them</a>. Tenzin also tells Korra that she needs to learn things from her enemies.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntimagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntimagicalFaction">The Equalists</a> under Amon claim that benders in the United Republic of Nations are forcing non-benders to live as second class citizens. This belief carries some weight since the state is governed entirely by an unelected council that at the time was chaired solely by benders, the heavy hitters in the military and the police are mostly benders, the biggest sport in town is one that only benders can play, and benders apparently get more job opportunities (such as firebenders who power the generators with lightning) than non-benders. They attempt to get rid of this injustice through terrorism, armed revolution, and Amon using his mysterious power to permanently take peoples bending away. The unsuccessful Equalist Uprising does convince the United Republic to abolish its unelected council and hold elections for a democratic government, leading to the victory of the non-bender President Raiko and, according to Asami, a system in which non-benders also have a voice.
</li><li> Unalaq is a tyrant who wants to unleash a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> upon humanity and take over the world, but his goal of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> removing the barrier between the material world and the spirit world</span> might not in itself be a bad thing. The dark spirit attack on the Southern Water Tribe's festival at the start of the seasonand Unalaq's success in handling it did establish that there are problems resulting from humans falling out of touch with the spirits. After defeating him, Korra decides to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leave the spirit portals open so that spirits can live among humans. While bringing back the spirits does cause some problems of coexistence in Republic City, it also results in some people around the world spontaneously developing airbending powers in season 3, which enables Tenzin to rebuild the Air Nation. Admittedly, that also leads to Zaheer getting airbending and managing to break himself and his companions out of prison.</span>
</li><li> Varrick has a point about the right of the Southern Water Tribe to use military force to resist Unalaq and his Northern Water Tribe's takeover despite the refusal of other countries to get involved, and while his "Nuktuk" movers are hilariously propagandistic, they do a lot to create popular sympathy for the Southern Water Tribe in the United Republic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He crosses the line with his plan to steal Future Industries from Asami and stage a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagAttack">False Flag Attack</a> against President Raiko to persuade the United Republic to join the war</span>.
</li><li> Season 3 gives us Earth Queen Hou-Ting, who conscripts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of the new airbenders</span> in Ba Sing Se as her personal army against their wills. While this is shown to be nothing but despicable, both she and Commander Bumi point out that as their monarch and head of state she really <em>can</em> conscript any of them she pleases. The problem is she's having them abducted <em>in secret</em>, keeping them from contacting their families and loved ones, having them "trained" by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> Dai Li agent (he basically just earthbends projectiles at them and forces them to try and deflect them and punished Kai when he kept another airbender from getting hit), and is treating them like slaves.
</li><li> At one point, a group of bandits tries to steal tax money the Earth Queen demanded Korra deliver to her in exchange for helping find the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> new airbenders</span> in Ba Sing Se. After she and Asami fight them and drive them off, one of them exclaims that she's on the wrong side, and the gold belongs to the people. Korra admits that she has a feeling that he's right, but still delivers the gold in the hopes the Earth Queen would uphold her end of the bargain, and calls the Earth Queen out when she doesn't.
</li><li> The main villains of Season 3, the Red Lotus society and their leader Zaheer, want to remove all world leaders and replace them with anarchy in the name of freeing people from the tyranny of their governments. Considering some of the authority figures we've already seenthe warmongering Fire Lords who preceded Zuko and Izumi, the inept President Raiko of the United Republic, and the cruel, vindictive Earth Queeneven Korra cant deny that Zaheer is correct in identifying the problem. However, the Red Lotus is willing to murder Korra and innocent people associated with her just because they stand in the way. Furthermore, the Red Lotus's assumption that people will become happy and free if they simply destroy the existing governments without replacing them with anything turns out to be hopelessly naïve. This is demonstrated in season 4, which shows the Earth Kingdom has spent three years divided into many weak states which cannot protect their people from bandit attacks or guarantee the availability of food. This situation ends up creating the villain of the fourth season, Kuvira, who becomes a dictator as tyrannical as the Earth Queen was in her quest to reunite and rebuild the Earth Kingdom. Korra makes sure to point this out when she visits Zaheer in prison.
</li><li> Zaheer is 100% right when he tells the Earth Queen that imprisoning Korra is idiotic because shes flirting with causing an international incident. She and Raiko are the only world leaders to whom Korra doesnt have a personal connection. Her dad, cousins, and Izumi could all send their armies in after her and Tenzin wouldnt take it lightly either.
</li><li> General Kuvira in Season 4 usurps the throne of the Earth Kingdom and instead crowns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing">herself Emperor</a> due to the heir apparent (Hou-Ting's bumbling nephew Wu) being an incapable leader who would essentially be a puppet installed by the other nations instead of a strong leader with enough authority to be able to push back against them. She also blames Suyin Beifong, her former mentor and surrogate mother for her complete refusal to stabilize the Earth Kingdom, not even with supplies, thus allowing the situation to get so bad. Having said that, Kuvira relies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">Appeal to Force</a> in all her negotiations, subjects her citizens to forced labor and reeducation camps, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">develops a superweapon to use against her enemies, and finally tries to conquer the diverse, democratic United Republic on the grounds that Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko created it out of the Fire Nation colonies that were stolen from the Earth Kingdom in the first place (ignoring the fact that the then-Earth King approved this)</span>. Wu himself eventually agrees with Kuvira about the obsolescence of the traditional monarchy after she is defeated, and decides to reform the Earth Kingdom into a republic with elected leaders.

Even the Lorax concedes that this would be too drastic a solution. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, the Thneed production goes too far and the very last Truffula tree is cut down to make them, resulting in not only the permanent closing of the Once-ler's factory, but the complete destruction of a beautiful forest.

</li><li> In the Season 5 finale, although having ulterior motives of stopping Mane 6 from ever befriending one another, Starlight Glimmer does save past Fluttershy from the bullies and preaches to Twilight how in her utopian society of equality (which Twilight helped destroy earlier) Fluttershy wouldn't have been bullied in the first place. Twilight, while admitting that's not exactly a bad thing to strive for, quickly turns the tables back by pointing out the aforementioned ulterior motive.
</li><li> Obvious motives aside, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Principal Cinch</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Friendship Games</a></em> is fairly justified in accusing the Wonderbolts team of cheating after witnessing Rainbow Dash "pony up", and also noting that Canterlot High's sudden (and unexpected) boost in academics and athletics coincided with the introduction of magic.
</li><li> In the episode <em>Once Upon A Zeppelin</em>, Twilight accuses Iron Will (who's more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>) of using underhanded business tactics and exploiting her fame for his own purposes without her consent. Iron Will points out that said business practices were outlined in the contract he <em>offered</em> Twilight's mother. It was Twilight Velvet who signed it without reading it through first. Offering the "free" vacation to Twilight Velvet instead of directly to Twilight (Sparkle) may have been a bit underhanded, but it wasn't his fault that she didn't tell her daughter about the fine print and he had every right in the world to expect them to uphold their end of the bargain <em>after</em> he delivered his half of the bargain.

<ul><li> Hordak is a central antagonist but his anger over Shadow Weaver and Catra lying to him makes sense. Trust is an important trait in relationships and lies means the person can't be trusted.
</li><li> Hordaks military strategy is measured and restrained. In The Price of Power, he initially refuses to squander troops on a wasteland like the Crimson Waste, and only changes his mind when he recognizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an opportunity to exile Catra</span>. In season 4, he criticizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Catra</span> for spreading troops too thin. It turns out that his military restraint was a smart course of action. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Catras bold, unrelenting blitz won the Horde multiple victories in the short term, but by spreading troops too thin, her strategy meant that the Horde was left in shambles after one large-scale ambush. In addition, by pushing the troops too hard, she also drove several soldiers to defect.</span>
</li><li> Catra's anger at Shadow Weaver taking credit for her successful mission of capturing Glimmer, Bow, and the Sword of Protection is quite understandable, as Catra did all the work and planning. As such, when Hordak scolds Shadow Weaver for losing all three in the rescue, Catra's mocking smirk towards the dark wielder is karmic.
</li><li> Catra was right to point out how wrong it was of Shadow Weaver to abuse her, an orphaned child who was in her care.
</li><li> In season 4, Shadow Weaver tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glimmer</span> that one thing she really needs to think about moving forward is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what kind of queen she will be. But, Glimmer letting her emotion guide her judgment to the point of reckless decisions was not what Shadow Weaver meant.</span>
</li><li> At the end of Season 4, Catra is on the receiving end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> delivered by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Double Trouble</span>. While incredibly cruel, it's also entirely correct, as they systematically call out of of Catra's issues, summarizing that the main reason for her own unhappiness is her incessant need for power and tendency to push all her friends and loved ones away in pursuit of it.
