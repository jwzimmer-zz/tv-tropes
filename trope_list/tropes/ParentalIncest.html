If the child is the aggressor in the relationship, it usually means he or she is seriously twisted in some way or in the very least has serious issues. Sometimes this is played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>, particularly in the case of mothers and sons, with the son understandably freaked out due to the mother's advances.

</p><p>This is a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing">Unequal Pairing</a>, since the parent is almost always at least psychologically if not always physically in a much more powerful position than the child.

Ibara goes to her adoptive father's room to seduce him, not out of any attractionshe actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">despises him</a> and doesn't think he's good enough for her adoptive motherbut because she worships her mother so completely that she wants to be just like her, and believes sleeping with her mother's husband will bring her closer to that goal. Unfortunately for her (or fortunately, as the case may be), she discovers that night that neither she nor her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">ever stood a chance</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KanonByChihoSaito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KanonByChihoSaito">Kanon by Chiho Saito</a></em> the incestuous parent/child relationship is the hub of the whole plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster">He Is My Master</a></em>, the sister-maids ran away from their home in the first place because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">they got tired of resisting their father's constant sexual advances</a>.</em>
</li><li> The ironically aptly-named Electra Complex relationship between the surrogate father and daughter pair of Nemo and Electra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em>.
</li><li> The anime villain Furumizu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade">Witchblade</a></em> has some creepy implications of this. Doesn't help the man has a very messed up reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> has an incredibly creepy example in the King of Midland and his feelings for his only daughter, Princess Charlotte, who is unfortunate enough to bear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">quite strong resemblance</a> to the late Queen of Midland. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Griffith has sex with Charlotte following Guts' leaving him and the Hawks, the King goes crazy, and after throwing Griffith into the Tower of Rebirth to be put to the torture and declaring the rest of the Hawks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw">outlaw</a>, he tries to rape Charlotte. She barely manages to fight him off, and the experience wracks him with incredible guilt, to the point where he visibly ages and falls ill. Charlotte (very understandably) wants nothing to do with her father afterwards, and won't even see him on his deathbed</span>.
</li><li> Seishirou Sakurazuka and his mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">Setsuka</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoBabylon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoBabylon">Tokyo Babylon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X1999</a></em>. No evidence about sexual encounters, thank God, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubText">Sub Text</a> is <em>incredibly</em> strong — specially in the CD dramas. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not helped by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastKiss">Last Kiss</a> in the manga, which comes <em>after</em> a teenage Seishirou <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">fights, defeats and kills Setsuka</a> as the requirement to become the Sakurazukamori.</span>

</li><li> This, along with many other types of perversion, occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em> with Toyama and his dad. It's also implied to be a part of the carefully crafted breeding program among the Class. The ultimate result is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kano, a guy with deformed legs (soon replaced with cybernetics), and an even more deformed mind. Just for example, he seems to genuinely believe that the world exists only inside his mind, and all his atrocities are just a form of self-discipline.</span>

</li><li> Later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after rediscovering her long lost daughter Ryuko (who she had thought was dead)</span>, Ragyo apparently has a threesome with her and her adopted daughter Nui Harime. It's later implied that this was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memory</a> Ragyo implanted, but even if that's true, it brings up the question of <em>why the hell she would implant a memory like that</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em>, one of the ways Jien (Dokugakuji) protected his younger brother (by his father's mistress) was by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"taking [his] father's place" and sleeping with his mother to calm her down.</span> He ends up killing her to keep her from killing Gojyo. Naturally, Dokugaku feels <em>incredibly</em> guilty about all of this, and, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> between Hakkai and Kanan, this is never spelled out in the anime version.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou">Gankutsuou</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Andrea Cavalcanti</span> not only tries to rape his half-sister, but actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>has sex</em> with their mother, Victoria.</span> Note that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>knew</em> she was his mother</span> at the time, while she was unaware.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Karas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Karas">Karas</a></em>, Otoha is revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>, his mother having been raped by his brother/father. It is suggested that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">congenital insensitivity to pain</a> is a result of his being a product of incest.

A recent chapter showed that this maybe due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">inherent innocence</a> about love rather than romantic designs on her father, though, as she apparently doesn't really know the difference between a kiss on the cheek and a "deep, passionate kiss." <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/mahou_sensei_negima/v28/c253/11.html">This leads to her saying that she wouldn't mind giving the latter to her dad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which elicits a disgusted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction">"No. Just...

Luckily a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Megaton Punch</a> from his father prevented it from going any further.
</li><li> There exists a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">yuri</a> manga called <em>1 x 1/2</em> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">a teenage girl who is sexually attracted to her mother</a>, and its made pretty clear how abundantly messed up everyone involved would have to be for her to even have such feelings to begin with, since the girl has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> tendencies and abandonment issues, possibly stemming from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her having been abused by an older classmate years before</span> and considering this to be normal behavior as a result. The mother does eventually find out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">even though shes horrified</a>, shes ultimately too passive to put her foot down and stop the situation from escalating to the point of them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kissing and sharing a bed</span>, which is hinted to be because she has only ever been in dysfunctional relationships which she doesnt know how to get out of. The daughters behavior is hinted to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> on her fathers side, since the fathers sister <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has sexually abused the mother apparently without her knowing that this is wrong</span>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">deceased father</a> is subtly implied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">have manipulated the mother into marrying him</a>, with their child possibly having been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>. Thus, when her daughter confesses, the mother is horrified but finds herself unable to do anything about it because she has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror">Conditioned to Accept Horror</a> over the years. The manga is extraordinarily disturbing to read through on pretty much every level, <em>despite</em> nothing overtly sexual being depicted.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a></em>, it is widely believed, but not confirmed (although he has not denied it, either), that Xia has this relationship with her son, Jubal.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics, Legion (a.k.a. David Haller), the psychotic, overpowered son of Professor Xavier with a legion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">split personalities</a>, time travels to the past and is implied to have raped his own mother Gabrielle Haller.
</li><li> In the dystopian divergent timeline of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a>, Magneto and Rogue eventually marry and have a son despite their initial surrogate father-daughter relationship after she permanently absorbed the powers and part of the psyche of his own secretly long-lost biological daughter Polaris. In addition, Rogue is canonically <em>even younger</em> in this reality than any of Magneto's prior biological children: Polaris and their fellow X-men Pietro and Wanda. One saving grace might be the fact that the mainstream continuity hadn't settled on Polaris being Magneto's actual daughter when this story was written, so the Oedipal aspect wasn't as blatant originally. Though it still was a story where Rogue wound up in love with her main father figure...
<ul><li> Their fellow AoA X-Men, the reformed berserker Sabretooth and the jailbait amazon Blink are a fan-favorite cult pairing despite having a surrogate father-daughter relationship, as he rescued her as a child from Apocalypse's slave pens and raised her to adolescence. This is due to the intense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastAndBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastAndBeauty">Beast and Beauty</a> pseudo-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a> nature of their relationship, which is exacerbated by the fact that they are both highly sensuous warriors with a deeply intimate psycho-emotional bond and physically demonstrative displays of affection. They were separated when they were both made to lead separate teams of inter-dimensional heroes known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles">Exiles</a>, but were eventually reunited on a single team. In fact, Blink's then-boyfriend and fellow Exiles teammate Mimic was revealed to have known that she would never love him or anyone else as much and feared that she loved Sabretooth instead. This was shown by the fact that despite having proven herself as a leader, Blink deferred to Sabretooth during field missions. Despite later being separated again on different teams, they are currently still both single, leaving fans ever hopeful. The fact that Mimic resembled Victor in more ways than one though is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse">hardly coincidental</a>.
<ul><li> Whenever they're together, their relationship is depicted as a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Fellow AoA mutant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">Nate Grey</a> has one hell of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a> story. The genetically-engineered son of his reality's Scott Summers and Jean Grey, he crosses over to the original timeline of Marvel-616 where he gets involved with Madelyne Pryor, the long-deceased clone of his biological mother. It is later revealed that he accidentally physically resurrected her with the sheer force of his immense mutant talent when he unconsciously and instinctively tried to psionically contact Jean Grey upon his arrival in the other reality (his interactions with 616!Jean as a rule, are all mother and son, which she reciprocates). He also later gets involved with <em>yet another</em> counterpart of his biological mother, when an evil counterpart of Jean Grey from <em>yet another</em> alternate reality disposes of and impersonates Madelyne Pryor. This Queen Jean, a Jean Grey corrupted by her own power, was revealed to have had a prior consort who was her reality's counterpart of Nate, essentially <em>her own</em> genetically-engineered son, who rebelled against her and was ultimately executed, but not before helping his alternate counterpart defeat his mother Queen Jean.
<ul><li> It should at this point be noted that he only met AoA!Jean once, briefly (though there was an instinctive connection), and it was quite some time before he realized what relation either Jean or Madelyne had to him. After that, he backed off, fast, from Maddy's advances. Maddy, on the other hand, didn't seem to have the slightest problem with it and acted as a textbook, if somewhat homicidal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> towards him. And his relationship with Queen Jean (who, again, he thought was Maddy) was, at least on his part, platonic. His mental fantasy of the perfect life, Greyville, had her as his best friend. Further, it also doesn't really help that he was forcibly aged to 17 and for a number of his appearances had absolutely nothing in the way of life experience.

It's an entire series of exactly what you think it is from an artist (Josman) famous for that specific genre (once even involving a <em>grandfather</em> of all people). To avoid allegations that he had a serious thing for his own dad, the artist said in an interview what he <em>really</em> loved were twins doin' it, and drew a token twincest story to prove it. No one believed him when that story still somehow managed to involve an older man in the mix...

In a 1942 storyline, the eponymous hero is injured and dying. He is nursed back to health by preteen girl "Butch" Buchanan. She becomes his sidekick, legal ward, and surrogate daughter for the rest of his series. But she originally viewed him as a gangster and declares herself his "moll", doing her best to seduce him.

To make it worse, she can't be older than eleven. It could be seen as a platonic parental kiss, but that's screwed by the fact it's an <em>open mouth</em> kiss (he even removed her teeth in order to do it).
</li><li> In Barbara Slate's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelLove">Angel Love</a></em>, Angel finds out that her sister Mary Beth left home and changed her name to Maureen McMeal due to the shame she carried of Angel and Mary Beth's father sleeping with Mary Beth, and is even ashamed that she actually enjoyed it. After Angel's father left the house when this was discovered, Angel was told by her mother that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReleasedToElsewhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReleasedToElsewhere">her father died and went to heaven</a>.
</li><li> A variation occured with the pre-Crisis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a>. Dinah was inhabiting the body of her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">near identical</a>) adult daughter when she fell in love with the alternate universe version of her deceased husband. Post-Crisis, the grossness and general oddness of the situation was fixed by simply making two Black Canaries: the modern day one is the daughter of the (now retired) original Black Canary from the '40s.
</li><li> The infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">Avengers</a></em> #200 contained something of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers">Carol Danvers</a> was kidnapped, mind controlled, and impregnated by Marcus Immortus, the son of Immortus.

The baby grew into an adult in under a day and turned out to be another version of Marcus, reborn on Earth. Carol hated the baby, but when she saw Marcus as an adult, she fell for him. Eventually they left together to go to another dimension, and the crazy part was, the other Avengers seemed perfectly okay with it. Despite Marcus handwaving it as not <em>really</em> being pregnancy and just something that "resembled pregnancy", he still refers to Carol as "Mother" and she did give birth to him. <em>Avengers Annual</em> #10 brought Carol back, made it clear she was raped, and let her give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speech to the others (and by proxy, to the writers of the original story who thought this was acceptable).
</li><li> The eleventh issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a></em> had a time-displaced Spider-Girl encounter her father during his earlier days as Spider-Man. Much to her disgust, Spider-Man at one point hits on Spider-Girl, not knowing that she is his future daughter.

<ul><li> To explain, Aurora, the planet mentioned, has done away with the concept of family. A centralized system tests the genetics of people who want to produce offspring together and gives the go-ahead. Once a child is born, the centralized system takes the child into custody and s/he is brought up in a communal nursery with no further interaction with her birth parents. Aurora is also a perfect example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture">Free-Love Future</a>, where sex is a casual pastime for everyone and no commitment is considered necessary. As such, as long as two closely related people do not procreate, sexual relations between them are perfectly normal and acceptable - and until procreation is intended, they are unlikely to know of the relationship in the first place. The example refers to an anomaly within this system, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where a roboticist interested in social dynamics decides to personally rear his daughter in his own home (he had to call in a lot of favors to be allowed that).</span> The girl grows up with her father, an unusual circumstance, and falls in love with him.

<ul><li> Played with in an episode. Dean goes back in time to see his parents as teenagers.

Also in that ep, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Yellow-Eyed Demon possesses Dean's mom's father and kills Dean's dad. The Demon makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">deal</a> with Dean's mom that promises he'll bring him back to life and Dean's mom accepts. How is the deal sealed? With a kiss. Dean's mom kisses her demon-possessed father.</span>
</li><li> In an earlier episode, Agent Henriksen tells Dean that he thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">John</a> brainwashed Dean into believing that demons and ghosts are real and probably molested him as a child. Of course, Henriksen said this just to make Dean angry.
</li><li> In "Family Remains", the antagonist is first believed to be the ghost of the daughter of the first victim. After all of the standard ghost-warding stuff fails, they figure out it was the dead daughter's daughter, who was a result of her father/grandfather raping her mother/half-sister. Jeez, these genealogies get complicated.
</li><li> Let's not forget poor Bela/Abby, who sold her soul to Lilith in exchange for having her father (and it may be implied her mother as well, though we never see her) killed because he was molesting her.
</li><li> Subverted in "Heartache". Sam and Dean break into the house of a deceased baseball player named Brick Holmes, but discover to their disgust that he apparently shared a bed with his mother Eleanor. It turns out that she was only posing as his mother, since "Brick Holmes" (born as a Mayan named Inyo) was an immortal man who met Eleanor when she was still a young woman, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">she continued to age while he remained young</a>.

<ul><li> There's an episode about a college student caught dumping her unwanted baby. By her father. Who she basically just met. Because she tracked him down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And it's not the first time she's gotten pregnant by him.</span> Naturally, their father is an upstanding pillar of the community. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After she's sentenced (or committed, I can't remember), he tries for custody of his (grand)son, but is shot down hard by Benson and Stabler.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's committed — but not for the unwanted live baby they found; she is acquitted of that. But later they find that she had a "stillbirth" a couple years prior, and Benson confronts her with that - and the girl blurts out that her father was also THAT baby's father, and she'd actually killed that baby herself. So she's committed for that earlier murder. The fact that the father had been schtupping his daughter longer than they'd thought makes them all the more determined to deny him custody.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A court judge was harsh on sex offenders after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he raped his 11-year-old stepdaughter and conceived a son</span>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> seduced her stepson and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convinced another man with whom she was having an affair to kill the father</span>.
</li><li> A murderer was in an incestuous relationship with his mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and killed her to free himself from her control</span>.
</li><li> Two brothers from season 1 were molested by their father: one grew up to be a serial rapist, the other turned out normal but got drunk and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake">killed a man he thought was his brother</a>.
</li><li> There was also the episode with a man who wanted lots of kids so he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">arranged for other men to impregnate his wife and, when she could no longer conceive, he artifically inseminated his daughter. It wasn't <em>his</em> sperm, but really that hardly matters.</span>
</li><li> Then there was the infamous reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fin's stepson, Darius, was the result of his mother being raped by her father</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in one episode guest-starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyIrons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyIrons">Jeremy Irons</a> as a therapist specializing in sexual addiction. He's ridden with guilt because he, a recovered sex addict himself, believes he raped his daughter during an incoherent moment in the past, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he finds out by episode's end that it was actually consensual sex with his daughter's friend, and the reason she was mad at him was that she was in love with her friend and was mad that her father came between them</span>.
<ul><li> A later episode in which Irons' character plays a supporting role involves two women sexually abused <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by their mother. The older one managed to get through it and live a relatively normal life, but the younger sister was so warped by the abuse that she tried to molest a little girl and then killed her when she freaked out.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A teenage girl goes missing and it's believed she was murdered by a man on trial. She's found having an affair with her music teacher and convincing herself they're in love. Her mother is upset as she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> charges the teacher and slaps him. She then starts talking about his seduction methods with first-hand knowledge. With her husband the cops all staring, she says she and the guy had a one-night stand... 17 years ago. "Do the math," she snaps as she reveals he's been sleeping with his own daughter. Unlike others from the show, he's more horrified than anyone else, begging "I didn't know" when the man everyone thought was the father has to be held back from throttling the guy. The girl's reaction? She <em>smiles brightly</em> as she's happy her father is a great musician rather than a garbage man, completely ignoring the incest part.</span>
</li><li> In another episode, a slew of young girls have been seduced by a man they believe to be their biological father (the result of a sperm donation he made in college). Mercifully, he actually isn't (he's impersonating the real donor, jealous of his perfect life—beautiful house/family/career and trying to destroy it), but that doesn't change the fact that he used their supposed biological connection to cajole them into bed. By the episode's conclusion, he's bedded the man's actual daughter that he had with his wife under the same pretext, claiming that her mother had an affair with him and he's the daughter's real father.
</li><li> In addition to being the focus of some episodes, this occasionally comes up as part of the backstory of a guest character, usually to explain some aspect of the character's situation or personality. In the most memorable example, a teenage girl who had been raped and pimped out by her biological father has lost her capacity to care about or empathize with anyone, to the point where she actively coerces her boyfriend into raping her adoptive sister (the reasons for which are never explained).

She got pregnant by her stepson and covered it up by inducing labor perilously early to create the illusion that she had been pregnant before her husband left. The child in question, now an adult, has recently been told of his true parentage by his church secretary, and has been lashing out at churches along with his adrenaline-junkie roommate.</span>
<ul><li> This is also part of the backstory of recurring antagonist Nicole Wallace. For most of her run on the show, this is only Goren's theory, but she seems to confirm it in her second-to-last episode when she tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Gwen Chapel</a> that "sometimes daddies can love too much".

As he does, he gradually starts to fall for her, and fantasizes about kissing her. When Lois off-handedly reveals that the diary is hers, unaware of the fact that Reese has developed a crush on the girl in the diary, Reese imagines going to kiss his mother as she is now, and is horrified.
</li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllSaints">All Saints</a></em> features an abandoned baby. When her teenage mother is found, she reveals, in a heartbreaking scene, that her father raped her and fathered her daughter, and that she abandoned her because she knew he'd do the same to another daughter.

This was ironic or prescient, because we later learn that his late wife and the mother of their son was also his own grandmother, having returned to life supernaturally after a failed attempt to murder Roger's father and aunt, Jamison and Nora Collins. Poor Roger never had any idea that he had married his grandmother, however... and neither did the writers until later.

She had her sights set on her thirteen-year-old grandson when she was killed.
</li></ul><ul><li> Strongly averted in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">body surfing</a> mother is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhodunnitToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhodunnitToMe">investigating her own murder</a> and is suddenly kissed by her adult son.

</li><li> The teaser for the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em> involves a case of a murdered teenage girl.

The girl, who has largely broken out of the cult brainwashing, was not happy about this.
<ul><li> An earlier episode features a child pornographer who's been molesting his elementary-school-aged daughter; when the mother found out and tried to get the kid away from him, he claimed <em>she</em> was the abusive one and that she had kidnapped the child. Fortunately for everyone except him, the perpeterator was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKiller">Cop Killer</a>, so the FBI had dug into his background and already found evidence that he was the abuser.

In the course of counseling, it comes out that both parents suffered this at the hands of their own fathers.

After being left to die by his father and then found by someone else, he meets him unrecognized on the road and kills him. He has several adventures (including solving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleOfTheSphinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleOfTheSphinx">Riddle of the Sphinx</a>) before heading home and marrying the Queen, who, yes, turns out to be his mother. He spends years with her — and they have <em>children</em> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">before finding out the truth about what happened</a>, and is so horrified by it all that he goes into exile, after exacting the punishment on himself for killing the old king to end a curse on the land, while she commits suicide.

She murdered her mother Clytemnestra in revenge for killing her father Agamemnon, and her name was used for the gender-inversion of the Oedipus complex.

</li><li> Other examples from Greek mythology beside Oedipus: Myrrha tricked her father Theias into incest, after Aphrodite inspired her with passion for him, and got pregnant.

Her corpse turned into a myrrh tree and, ironically, produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Adonis</a>.

</li><li> Thyestes was told by an oracle that he could only avenge the murder of his three sons on his brother Atreus if he had a son by his own daughter.

Poor Pelopia kills herself with shame, while Aigisthos kills Atreus.
</li><li> Antaeus is the son of Poseidon and Gaia. Gaia is Kronos's mother. Kronos is Poseidon's father. Truly, Greek myth knows no limits.
</li><li> Also consider that Oranos was both Gaia's first son and the father of her other children.
</li><li> Gaia also provides quite possibly one of the only instances of <em>great</em> grandparental incest. Hephaestus (who is the son of Hera, who is the daughter of Kronos, who is the son of Gaia) was overcome with unrequited lust after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">he tried and failed to rape his half-sister Athena,</a> and promptly ejaculated on the earth.

</li><li> Well, Heracles is Zeus' son. And his great-great-grandson (his mother Alcmene was the granddaughter of another of Zeus's bastards, the hero Perseus). This happens a lot. Danae was the great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Zeus and Io, as were (give or take some greats) Semele (whom Zeus impregnated with Dionysos) and Europa (who gave Zeus Minos, Rhadamanthos, and Sarpedon).
</li><li> The homosexual variety also occurs.

On other stories, though, Eros is the son of Khaos, which is the mother of Gaia, which is the mother of Kronos, which is the father of Zeus, who is the father of Ares.

Since a fair number of Biblical scholars doubt he would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">punished him so harshly over merely a little embarrassment,</a> they suggest this phrase was actually some kind of euphemism for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">molestation or even full-fledged rape.</a>
</li><li> After Lot and his daughters escaped from Sodom's destruction, the daughters believed that since their fiancés were dead, they were the last living women and their father the last living man in the area. Having children to populate your locale being rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> back then, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">got their father drunk and raped him</a> in order to have his babies. Nine months later, they each had a son, Moab and Ben-Ammi. The former's name sounds something like the Hebrew word for "from father" and the latter's name means (literally) "son of my paternal uncle" or (figuratively) "son of my people" in Hebrew, and these boys eventually married and had families of their own that grew into two entire nations. <br/><br/>Some detractors contend that the Hebrews made up this story to smear the Moabites and the Ammonites, who were Semitic cultures like the Hebrews, though polytheistic and pagan. However, these particular acts occurred centuries before the institution of the sexual laws in Leviticus. As such, they may serve as a kind of retroactive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop:</a> "This is the kind of skullduggery people used to do back before we had those laws against sleeping with close relatives, so aren't you glad we have them now?" Also, later books of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> clearly state without shame that the Davidic line (including none other than Jesus Christ) came from the Moabites through Ruth.

Afterward, when she asked him bitterly, "Did you derive any pleasure, then, from the place whence you issued?" he allegedly responded "Did I do this for any other purpose than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">provoke</a> my <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">creator</a>?"
</li><li> In 1 Corinthians 5:1-3, Paul chides the Corinthian believers' fellowship for not having expelled a certain man for sleeping with his father's wife (probably referring to a step-mother), pointing out that not even the pagans around them (Corinth being a rather decadent and sex-obsessed city) would tolerate that kind of sexual immorality and that they ought not to associate themselves with it, either.
</li><li> Even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> came to its close, certain Christian denominations' legends of the saints had some of this:

After a very eventful pursuit, Markella's dad found her near a cave: the rocks had half-swallowed the poor girl, but her head stayed out, so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">beheaded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">her</a> (and in versions where she was swallowed only up to her waist, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreastAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreastAttack">mutilated her breasts</a>) and then threw her head away, which is said to have floated to another island.

But the husband is unfaithful, and blatantly rejects her in favor of a younger woman. Her sons refuse to defend her, equating youth with usefulness. The rejected wife is granted dark powers by a malevolent entity, uses a disguise to seduce her husband, kidnaps his lover and holds her hostage, then murders him. Later, she seduces her oldest son (a powerful warrior) the same way, is impregnated by him, then kills him. Then she uses dark magic to transfer her unborn child to the captive woman's womb, and she bears the first annis. She does the same with her second eldest son, a farmer and outdoorsman, uses the same dark magic, and the infant is the first greenhag. Her youngest son, a sailor and fisherman, is not fooled by such a trick and wary due to the deaths of his siblings, so this time she disguises herself as <em>his</em> wife to seduce him, kills him, and again, impregnates her hostage, bearing the first sea hag.</span> Van Richten himself admits in his narrative that the ghastly story is likely apocryphal, and a sidebar confirms this view.

Neither of them apparently know they are actually blood-related, and it is unclear whether or not Eike still has eternal youth.
</li><li> Characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar">Medieval: Total War</a></em> can have this as a surprisingly common trait, reducing their religious support if it's discovered. This can sometimes happen with rather unlikely characters, such as unmarried 15 year olds. Strangely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> never happens unless you specifically order it.

</li><li> In the <em>Old Gods</em> expansion Zoroastrians were given the option of marrying close relatives, including children and parents, it gives a boost to vassal opinion as they view it as a holy marriage. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchites">Messalian Christians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (treated as a heresy of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism">Nestorianism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) have a similar feature.

<ul><li> As of a recent official Q&amp;A for the Going Rogue expansion, this has been rather humorously averted. The devs of the game had actually <em>failed to notice</em> this implication when the Praetorians were featured originally, and several fans calling attention to it got a rather entertaining "oh, crap, we did <em>not</em> mean to do that" reaction from them.

</li><li> However, whenever <em>Meg</em> makes any advances towards Lois, even if Chris did so first with no repercussions or if it was only a joke (as both of this scenarios did happen), she is immediately reviled and forced from the house/room.
</li><li> There's also "Peter's Progress," which has Peter's past life involved with <em>at least</em> a woman identical to (and named) Meg, but is most likely actually Meg's past life. Lois' past life, on the other hand, marries Stewie's past life when she's misled to think Peter is dead.

<ul><li> Though the people we see in the house for "family game night" don't look anything like his relatives that we've seen, so it may have just been a weak excuse he made up.
</li></ul></li><li> There was also the time he got an erection while hugging his transgender mother.
<ul><li> And a recent episode has Quagmire having sex with his transgender mother due to meeting a woman even kinkier than he is.
