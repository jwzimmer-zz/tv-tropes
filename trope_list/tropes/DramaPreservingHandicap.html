Sometimes this becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a>.

Almost every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> story is about this, as are a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">Right Hand vs. Left Hand</a> stories where the heroic factions would normally be able to beat the villains if they worked together.
</p><p>A mundane version of this trope would be the heroes' ammo count in a gunfight. During normal scenes, the heroes will be able to waste ammunition with reckless abandon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">shooting at anything and everything</a> but not hitting much of either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">while the enemy does the same,</a> and barely any mention being given to how many rounds are in the chamber or how many magazines are left. But then sometimes the heroes are counting their rounds, shouting "reloading!" or "last mag! Make it count!", their shots becoming more careful and sparse while the bad guys close in on their position. At this point, the heroes will either start making plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">go out with a bang</a> or hope some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> show up to pull their asses from the fire.

In the Cell Saga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Cell</a> has proven to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">completely outmatched</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super Saiyan 2 Gohan</a>. Then he gets his arm broken by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">Super</a></em> Perfect Cell.
<ul><li> Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifices</a> himself to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Cell's suicide explosion</a> from ending the series entirely, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">twofold gives Cell a power boost due to his Saiyan Cells</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">ability to regenerate</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">gets Goku out of the way</a>.
</li><li> Upon his return, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">immediately slays Trunks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSneakAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSneakAttacks">while everyone is distracted</a>, removing him from the picture as well.
</li><li> Lastly, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sold</a> Vegeta's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a></em> against him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">for Trunks' sake</a>), responds with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeteorMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeteorMove">strike strong enough to floor Vegeta instantly</a>, and almost kills him were it not for Gohan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave">Diving Save</a></em>, which leaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Gohan weakened as well.</a>
</li><li> The stage is then set for the ultimate <em>Beam-O-War</em> of all time, which would have been impossible to do otherwise as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Gohan didn't need help at all</a> until he was injured.
</li><li> This also happened at the start of the Androids Saga due to Goku's Heart Virus kicking in while he's fighting Android 19 and leaving him out of commission until Cell is about to absorb Android 17.
</li><li> Likewise, the Freeza Saga pulls this for both Goku and Captain Ginyu. With Goku's new level of strength after training in 100G, he is easily overpowering the Ginyu Force - and that's not taking into account that we also have Krillin, Gohan, and Vegeta healed up to full strength, plus a newly-resurrected Piccolo joining the mix not long after. Banded together, they could potentially give Freeza a serious run for his money despite his status as the dreaded. Thus, Ginyu steals Goku's body, it gets beat up while he's in control, and when Goku's mind returns to it he's sealed up in a healing tank while everyone else is dealing with Freeza, who transforms past their current limitations and eventually mops the floor with them. When Goku recovers, Vegeta's dead and the others are beaten and exhausted, setting the stage for a 1-on-1 Freeza fight. In turn, while Ginyu's in control of Goku's body to keep him from curbstomping everyone with Goku's powers the bodyswitch ends up weakening him, giving Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta a fighting chance.

<ul><li> This trope in general runs wild throughout <em>StrikerS</em>. The stronger heroic characters spend nearly the entire season operating under power limiters, and with that in place most of the fighting is done by the newbie Forwards. Nanoha, Fate and Signum don't get into any serious fighting until the climax.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">supplemental materials</a> after the end of the main events of the second season, Nanoha and Fate suspect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">the Wolkenritter</a> held back to avoid killing them, not wanting Hayate to be responsible for murder. The Wolkenritter also are forced to restrict their use of cartridges (which increase their magic power and enable them to use their more powerful moves) and magical energy in general (because they have to fill the book on a short timetable and keep energy in case the Bureau attacks them), which leads them to sometimes hold back or flee from the protagonists to conserve energy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce">Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force</a></em> implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Signum</span> may now suffer from this because, despite having risen up from her hospital bed, her body hasn't fully recovered yet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">from the heavy injuries sustained during her fight with Cypha</span>. It's also implied the possibility of her spinal injuries leaving permanent sequels but that's yet to be confirmed.

For the time of the WYC, Misugi was completely recovered from the heart disease. The only handicap remaining is his rather low stamina.

The only thing controlling this power is her personality. If she doesn't believe she can do something, she can't. If she doesn't think of trying something because she's been raised or led to believe it's impossible, she doesn't even think to try it. Her kill-attack is also kept under control by her personality which is unsuited to battle in the way other characters are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until she takes a third option and incorporates the kill attack into her much more powerful defensive shield, making it a pretty powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> and marking her evolution from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Combat Medic</a></span>.

</li><li> In the Ryuuguujou arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, Gintoki and Katsura were turned into old men before they can see any action, by Tamebako G, a device that can turn anyone into old people. The only reliable fighters at the time was Kagura and Kyuubei, and later the rest of the main characters were turned into old people as well. Had the device never exist, the arc could have easily ended in one episode. The great moment and Gintoki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> will never happened as well if that's the case.

What should have been an easy battle for her (given the foe's fighting style) ends up putting her on the defensive, all to allow Ranma (who had run out on her earlier) to come back to help her and defeat the enemy in a single panel.
</li><li> Another deliberate instance (and lampshaded) is found in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts">Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics</a> tournament. Normally, Ranma is far, far above Kodachi's league —but the rules of the sport state that contact without use of a tool is forbidden, and thus Ranma is restricted to the use of tools instead of his own style.
</li><li> This is true for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts">Martial Arts and Crafts</a> Ranma gets involved in. None of the bizarre martial arts practitioners have Ranmas level of skill (With the possible exception of the Martial Arts Tea masters, whom he never faces in a direct battle), as Ranma is capable of mastering the art fast enough to win the rematch, or sometimes the first match.
</li><li> Ranma's girl form sometimes counts, as Ranma is physically weaker as a girl. However it's usually also noted that he's faster that way too, and considering Ranma's specialty is speed, this doesn't come up unless he really needs that last extra bit of strength. His biggest problem in the girl form is usually shorter reach, since as a girl his (her?) arms and legs are shorter.

</li><li> Before Sesshoumaru, there was Miroku's Wind Tunnel which did the same exact thing, as it sucked everything in it's path into a black hole. Naturally, Naraku comes up with poisonous bees to keep Miroku from sucking him up and just ending the series. Many other enemies who weren't Naraku would also be willing to take hostages or had other things to make Miroku's wind tunnel useless like attacking it (physical wounds speed up the critical point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> that will make the Wind Tunnel kill him).

<ul><li> Pain vs. Naruto could have been considerably one sided in Pain's favor had he been allowed to kill Naruto instead of merely capture him alive.
</li><li> Similarly, Deidara holds back against Gaara, and except for one explosive he drops on the village to divert Gaara's attention, doesn't use many powerful bombs. When he goes up against Sasuke, whom he doesn't need to take alive, he uses powerful explosives while trying to kill him. This could apply to the Akatsuki in general, who are forced to capture the jinchuuriki live, but these two examples stand out.

The fight seems close, going back and forth, with impressive displays on both sides, but eventually Itachi comes out on top, reaches out to end it and..... dies. No visible injury. He just... falls over, dead. It turns out that Itachi had been dying from illness for some time, and was only alive at all by that point due to copious amounts of medication. Not only that, but due to overuse of the Mangekyo Sharingan if Sasuke was more than around 3 meters away, all Itachi could see of him was a hazy smear even while standing still. And Itachi actually wanted Sasuke to win. Tobi explicitly notes after the fight that even considering the fact that Itachi was essentially a walking legally blind corpse, if he had actually wanted to win, Sasuke would be dead.
</li><li> This trope is a constant companion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tobi</a> in every battle in which he participates. His abilities make him a defensively formidable combatant and even knowing about his abilities and planning against them isn't enough, as Fu, Torune, and Konan can testify. So in order to get past this, all of his opponents have had some sort of exclusive technique to counter his warping/intangible abilities or on him himself imposed what that limitation. Minato was able to defeat Tobi by just a split-second using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> technique; Konan had been observing Tobi's abilities in Akatsuki the whole time and she had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">''heavily'' plan, simulate and plant billions of traps</a> to battle him, and she still lost; Kakashi, Naruto, Guy, and Killer Bee had been having trouble even scratching Tobi until Kakashi realized he just happened to have the exact same Kamui dimension as Tobi; At that moment when he becomes the Jinchuuriki of the Ten Tails, he is unable to use Kamui due to having the Ten Tails sealed inside his body. And this is not to mention the fact that in each of these battles he had only one of his Mangekyou eyes which means that he could use only half his strength.

</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> example, this time from the anime. Ash could easily beat the Cerulean Gym if he used Pikachu, but he's facing Misty and Pikachu doesn't want to battle her, so he's forced to use his non-Electric Pokemon.
<ul><li> Ash is only rarely allowed to have and use powerful, evolved Pokemon on his team. He's been allowed to keep evolved Pokemon on his team in the most recent seasons, but the early show (the Takeshi Shudo era) deliberately went out of its way to <em>submarine</em> Ash's journey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">To Be a Master</a>. Butterfree was released to go participate in his mating season, Primeape was given to a boxer to go be trained<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ct35');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ct35" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ct35');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After winning the tournament it had just participated in... no, that makes no sense to us, either</span> (in the very episode that <em>it began to listen to Ash</em>, no less), Pidgeotto evolved into Pidgeot and was left with a flock of other Pidgey and Pidgeotto in the very first episode of the Orange Islands arc, the list goes on. (Misty had some of this, too — when she returns to Cerulean City to briefly star in her sisters' underwater ballet, the episode ends with Misty's sisters relieving her of Starmie).
</li><li> When he was allowed to <em>keep</em> powerful Pokemon, they would often have personality quirks, flaws, or foibles designed to prevent them from operating at maximum (or even remotely decent) efficiency. Most famously, Ash's Charizard was temperamental and often simply refused to lift a finger to help Ash in his battles. Late in the Orange Islands (EP105), Charizard is moved by Ash's devotion and finally decides to get its butt in gear. However, in the Johto arc, Ash is told that Charizard is too powerful and that he's been abusing its superiority, and the writers have him leave Charizard in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Charicific Valley</a> for training (EP134)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ch3a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ch3a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ch3a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The writers had apparently been planning this for a while, writing scenes to downplay Charizard's actual strength, such as when the Chikorita Ash would eventually catch managed to <em>slam it into a mountainside</em></span>. Look at those episode numbers again — Ash gets to enjoy a hard-earned, obedient Charizard for <em>less than thirty straight episodes</em>. This made room for Cyndaquil, a little badger cub with powerful fire attacks hampered by its serious ignition problems.
</li><li> Similarly, the writers used Ash's insistence on dropping his whole team (aside from Pikachu) with Oak at the beginning of each new series and starting from scratch to keep him from using his League-level Pokémon in early in the new region.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yusuke is at a disadvantage against Kazemaru and Rando because he already used up his Reigun (which, at the time, he could use only once per day) on his previous opponent in the tournament.

He's also almost entirely collected and has it together much more than either of them who both have their share of mental issues. By all rights he should utterly crush Lelouch in battle, and nearly does. His flaw? He has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">unspecified terminal illness</a> that regularly disables him with great pain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a>.

Initially, the machine is in poor condition after being buried in a mountain face for a few millenia, and Loran is an inexperienced pilot working from an unintuitive user manual. When he does gain enough skill, he's handed a pair of nuclear warheads and hides them in the chest compartments, forcing him to take a backseat in battles until he can get rid of them.

Therefore, Legato gives Vash a device that weakens his own special power, and explicitly invokes this very trope as the reason why he'd give him such a device.

Think of how often he comes into contact with all sorts of alien technology, high-tech outfit technology, and super-scientists with all sorts of awesome nonlethal crime-fighting gadgets...and consider that he still uses mostly what he can make himself.

And given that he's a billionaire, he could make anything that he needs.

But he can't fight at super-speed. The in-universe explanation for this is that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">holds back to keep from injuring anyone else</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">The</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">real</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">explanation for it is simply that someone with the strength of the Hulk and the speed of the Flash could never even be challenged, let alone defeated.</a> The real reason becomes especially evident when the villains with Superman's powers, who have no reason to hold back, also face the same problem. Later stories such as those in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> implied that he is simply not agile enough to fight at superspeed, comparing him to Usain Bolt while Wonder Woman is Bruce Lee, which still doesn't make much sense because of all the non combat tasks he does at super speed.

He only had 9999 units of power himself, but he was taught how to draw energy from his symbiotic outfit, which had the ability to regenerate it. It took longer to draw from the suit, so he had to use his own built in energy for fast reactions, and fear of running out is why he cached the huge military weapons in his alley. After being dragged to hell and coming out again, the problem went away.
</li><li> Although he was never more than a C-list character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker">Sleepwalker</a> had a major advantage in that he could focus his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">warp</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">beams</a> directly on any human opponent, which would turn them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">Noodle People</a> and force them to experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourWorstNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourWorstNightmare">Your Worst Nightmare</a> over and over again. The reason Sleepy didn't do this was because all the members of his race swear a very strict oath to never use their warp vision on living beings. The sole exception is when people are being used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">People Puppets</a>, at which point hitting them with a Sleepwalker's warp beams actually frees them from the demonic possession.

This is because Marv Wolfman notoriously found Kid Flash's speed powers difficult to write without making the rest of the team look useless.

<ul><li> The character <em>routinely</em> deals with planet-eating megamonsters and walks without blinking through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcidTripDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcidTripDimension">Acid Trip Dimensions</a>, but he's still a human being who needs the free use of his hands and voice to cast spells. Attacking him physically is a routine method of effecting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina">Deus Exit Machina</a>. On the other hand, he has enemies that could and would easily squash him like a bug, except that they prefer to play cat-and-mouse with him and prolong the fun. This gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Strange</a> enough time to spot their weaknesses and exploit this knowledge to defeat them.
</li><li> Strange's power level also make him notoriously difficult to write in team-ups or crossovers, which is why he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>. When Doctor Strange later joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a>, he was quickly stripped of his Sorcerer Supreme status, which greatly weakened him and limited what he could do with his powers. He would not be restored to full power until the final issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBendis">Brian Bendis</a>' run.

Because of this, her enemies naturally try to find ways to stop her from speaking. Even though Zatanna's been defeated many times by someone shutting her mouth, and though the backwards speaking isn't her actual superpower rather than just a tool she uses to focus her magic, for whatever reason she hasn't really learned other ways of casting her spells, so the handicap remains. Averted at one point when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> thought this about her so he gagged her and shot her in the throat for good measure, thinking that would neutralize the threat she posed. She managed to avoid death by scrawling "Heal Me" backwards <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen">in her own blood</a>.</em> She also recently learned sign language.
<ul><li> There was a period in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> where her powers were seriously weakened after she overexerted herself one time too many, which meant she now merely had control over the elements of fire, air, water and earth.
</li><li> It's also been established that there are nebulous limits on her power. During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalNight">Final Night</a></em>, a civilian asked why she couldn't just turn the sun back on with her magic.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> run, it was shown that her spells take a physical toll on her body, and that particularly powerful ones eat away at her stamina and can render her physically exhausted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>:
<ul><li> Since the Green Lantern ring is repeatedly stated to be the "most powerful weapon in the universe" and can literally do anything the wielder wills it to, wielders have to have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">weakness to yellow</a> come up constantly, have the rings taken away from them or otherwise neutralized, or have the wielder have some personal hangup that keeps them from using the ring at it's full power to justify the fact that they can't just wish the problem of the week away.
</li><li> During the iconic "Hard Traveling Heroes" period from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> where Green Lantern and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> set off on a trip across America, the Guardians of the Universe weakened the potency of GL's ring. This, among other things, meant that the ring no longer provided automatic protection from mortal wounds, which allowed the writer to use more grounded, realistic threats than usual.

</li><li> In the aforementioned <em>Logan</em>, Wolverine's healing factor is now much weaker than it was when he was in his prime <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to the adamantium in his body poisoning him</span>.

</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty">Bruce Almighty</a></em> was completely omnipotent, aside from 2 rules. He couldn't tell anyone about his powers, and he couldn't affect free will. Most of the difficulties that Bruce encounters could have been solved had he not had to obey the two rules, as evidenced by his attempts to make Grace love him. Hell, even without willing her to love him, telling her about his powers probably would have helped her to understand why Bruce was doing some of the things he did, and maybe help her to forgive him. It's like God wanted Bruce to struggle...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">and He did</a>. The point of the exercise was to show Bruce that even omnipotence couldn't solve his problems, which were caused by his failure to appreciate the good things in his life and his refusal to put any effort into becoming a better person. Grace leaving him is the one problem he cannot solve with God's powers, and this realization is the catalyst that gets him to do the hard work of working on himself.

</li></ul><hr/><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, initially, it's in both sides' best interest to keep the war a secret. The Yeerks prefer a strategy of infiltration, then suddenly seizing control of the planet, in order to minimize both Yeerk casualties and the deaths of thousands of potential host bodies. The Animorphs, on the other hand, prefer the war also remain a secret, for tactical reasons: the Yeerks have much more advanced technology and would certainly win any open engagement where they were free to use all of their weapons (a bunch of animals can't do much good against Yeerk capital ships destroying cities from orbit). Also, the primary reason the Yeerks want Earth is because of the large population, and a war would reduce the value. On the other hand, there are so many damn humans compared to Yeerks (6 billion versus a couple hundred thousand) that open warfare might even hurt the Yeerks despite their serious technology because humanity could and probably would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> any terrestrial fortifications, at least enough to turn the campaign into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> that the Andalites could take advantage of.
<ul><li> There has been several books where the central plan they Animorphs had was to reveal the existence of the Yeerks to the world in such an obvious way that even the most skeptical had to admit they were there and let the human military bring the Yeerks down, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">in every case their plan to do so either fails and/or backfires horribly so that the secret war can continue.</a>
</li><li> Then there's the morphing technology itself. As it gives whoever has it the power to turn into any life-form the user can touch, its power and applications are potentially limitless. However, what keeps it out of Story Breaker territory is that the inventors the Andalites lack the strategic thinking necessary to use it for anything other than infiltration, and the protagonists only have access to Earth animals most of time, which keeps the 6 from being able to easily win the war single-handedly. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Visser Three/One does not have these limitations, and as a result the protagonists barely escape with their lives time and time again.

The most glaring example is in the episode "Disaster", where Troi's empathic abilities abruptly become functionally useless, preventing her from determining how many people are alive or dead, or where they are on the ship. The best excuse is that everyone is freaked out. But this neglects the fact that the Enterprise has been in deadly danger before and Troi's powers were never white-noised (except when dramatically necessary). The main purpose of this power outage is to preserve the tension over the question of whether or not to separate the saucer section from the stardrive section which might explode. Hence she cannot tell if anybody is alive in that part of the ship, or if particular individuals (even her closest friends, the command staff) are among the living period.

When it comes time to fight him you find out that at 80 ATK and 80 DEF, he has more statistical power than anything else in the game... and then you actually meet him, it turns out he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> who despises himself for killing children for the sake of his kingdom's hope.

She possess almost unmatched combat skills, excellent stats, is practically immune to all forms of magecraft and possess some of the most powerful Noble Phantasms in existence, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Excalibur</span> - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Sword</a> capable of flattening mountains. She would normally be capable of single-handedly defeating all opposition, with only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Gilgamesh</a> being a challenge, which would make the novel rather unexciting as she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">partnered</a> with the main character — a guy who has next to no actual magical power. So she ends up getting improperly summoned, which leaves her with reduced stats and inability to regenerate prana through normal means - which limits her to single use of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Excalibur</span> before she becomes almost cripplingly weakened. Further more she only reclaims her third Noble Phantasm - which power makes her immortal and invulnerable - just before the last battle when she has to face Gilgamesh, the strongest of Heroic Spirits. Predictably, it turns out to be exactly what she needs to win.
<ul><li> She doesn't have all her Noble Phantasms because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as King Arthur, she made a deal with the world right before she <em>died</em> to claim the Grail, which limits her to have <em>only</em> the Noble Phantasm she had with her on her death bed <em>and</em> causes her not to be a full and true Heroic spirit... even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a> or as Rin's Servant</span>.
</li><li> The only reason anyone lasts longer than ten seconds against Gilgamesh is because he's too arrogant to start off a fight using full effort. By the time he realizes he might need to go all out just to survive, it's too late.

<ul><li> Ultra-powerful post-splice Vaarsuvius is the most powerful mage to have ever existed...as long as they hold on to the splices. Good thing one of them (a legendary necromancer no less, who would have been uniquely qualified to help against V's undead foe) slips away BEFORE the elf goes to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Xykon, or else the Order Of The Stick's quest would end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. Plus, Vaarsuvius has a revelation about more effective use of their power immediately <em>after</em> losing the other two splices. And they were further hampered by the fact that every stat other than their effective caster level (which, before losing the first splice, was somewhere in the <em>90s</em>) and available spell slots was <em>not</em> enhanced by the splice.
<ul><li> V gets another lesson from the black dragon just before all that. In an anti-magic field, V is just a talking monkey, while the dragon is still a dragon.

</li><li> This also applies to Azure City being captured and taken over by Team Evil. Having the resources of a powerful city-state at their beck and call and ruler ready to accommodate them in any way gives the good guys a possible edge against the forces of darkness. In order to keep a real sense of drama and impending doom through several more story arcs, something had to happen to make sure the good guys wouldn't have it so easy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Celestia may be the princess of Equestria, but being such a powerful entity makes her the queen of this trope as she could theoretically solve every problem in the series if she isn't taken out of the picture somehow. The only time an excuse is given for her inaction is when faced with Tirek who could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain">drain her power</a> and thus become a bigger threat. The rest of the time she sits it out at the palace or is being held hostage while Twilight and company save the day, and when she does step up to fight she either gets her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">royal can thoroughly kicked</a> by the unexpectedly powerful villain or finds her magic rendered unuseable. Princess Luna is only moderately better as she <em>has</em> gotten to save the day a couple times, much to the chagrin of Celestia fans who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">are literally begging for "Sunbutt" to get off her laurels and finally get an episode of her own</a>.
<ul><li> As of Season 7, she does in the episode "A Royal Problem", and it gives the implication that she's been holding back in fear she might harm others by using too much power at once. Of course this doesn't explain why she thinks that's a bigger risk than standing back and doing nothing, but it's at least something.
</li></ul></li><li> Twilight Sparkle's biggest weaknesses is crumbling under pressure combined with an inability to quickly improvise strategies, effectively meaning she often forgets to dip into her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">ever-increasing array of spells</a> in a fight and instead tends to just rear up and blindly shoot blasts from her horn. Notably this is a driving reason behind how Starlight Glimmer was able to take her down in two separate battles.
<ul><li> All the villains really need to do to prevent the magic of friendship from ruining their evil plots is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">confront Twilight physically and knock her out</a> (or hire a goon or two to do it), but none of them ever thinks of this.
</li></ul></li><li> Unsurprisingly after Twilight Sparkle and Tirek's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z Level</a></em> tussle in the Season 4 Finale, the Season 5 Premiere villain Starlight Glimmer specialized in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Power Nullifying</a>: rather than overpower the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Mane 6</a> she simply snatched away their cutie marks (and by extension their skills and extraordinary abilities) leaving them borderline helpless.
</li><li> Even back in the Season 3 premiere, King Sombra is cunning enough to invoke this. He uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Power Nullifier</a> curse to block Shining Armor's magic and prevent him from helping Princess Cadance with her shield spell, waits for her to exhaust herself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> situation without her aforementioned husband's backup now, and indirectly gets Twilight with one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> traps to prevent her from just teleporting to safety with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Changeling Hive</span> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2">To Where And Back Again - Part 2</a>" is surrounded by a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> field, preventing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Discord</a> from just solving all of the episode's problems with a snap of a finger (and also explains how they were able to capture the main cast and the princesses, which is why it's up to the secondary characters to save the day in the first place.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyDucksTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyDucksTheAnimatedSeries">Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series</a></em>;
<ul><li> Mainly for the benefit of the Ducks, as damage inflicted on the Raptor early in the series leaves Dragaunus forced to focus more effort on finding a new source of power for his ship than actually conquering the planet.
</li><li> A more distinct example occurred in the episode "The Human Factor", when damage to the Mask forced the Ducks to rely on more conventional detective work to investigate odd events in a small town <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the Mask would have quickly revealed that everyone in that town had been replaced by robots</span>; when Wildwing observed at the end that recent events would have been easier with the Mask, Tanya noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">it would have made for a much shorter episode</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>, a burglar breaks into the girls house. Since he is an ordinary, non-super powered human, the girls could easily deal with him...if it weren't for the fact that the Professor needs to sleep for a dissertation he's giving the next day, and they don't want to wake him up, thus forcing them to hold back when dealing with the crook.
