</p><p>Religion makes for great motifs and imagery in fiction and art, but it's also a varied and complex topic. This means that creators often take liberties, either to serve the story or due to lack of research. This may range from ignoring minor details of doctrine to broadly ignoring basic beliefs. The degree of variation often relates to how closely related a creator's culture is to the specific religion; the lesser the relation, the greater the liberties were taken.

</p><p>It's worth noting that one person's artistic license is another person's dogma. People sometimes choose to believe or disbelieve their own faiths as they see fit, from crusaders violating the Christian prohibition on murder to ISIS violating Islam's sanctions against most of their inhumane activities. A group or individual's take on an established faith can be smothered as heresy... or it can found its own religion.

<ul><li> In Mexico, there is a common PSA for a children's illness organization depicting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Littlest Cancer Patient</a> as an angel. The text translates to English roughly as, "We want no more angels in Heaven; we need them down here." It's probably supposed to mean "we don't want dead kids, we want them to live" and they are using angel in the "cute" sense, but this is a serious misunderstanding of Catholic and Christian dogma. While there is a rank in the hierarchy of angels called "Powers", which are made up of human souls who were "made perfect by their righteousness," they're technically not angels, just drafted human souls. And if they have actually read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">source material</a>, they'd probably think twice before saying they need them down here, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">angels are weird in a sense</a>.

Unfortunately, it also took the original schism between the Protestant and Catholic Churches (which <em>did</em> cause one of the most devastating periods in European history) and kept that same conflict going for centuries after the two sides had reconciled, with Hellsing and Iscariot quietly at war with each other and the Catholic Church commissioning a new crusade into England.

<ul><li> The villains in the story plan to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a>, a devil-looking mutant, installed as the pope then at a crucial time have his image inducer fail revealing him to be the Antichrist while distributing communion wafers that when activated will cause people to dissolve, simulating the Rapture, which will cause all the Catholic Church to declare war on all the mutants, wiping out the mutants, breaking the Catholic Church, destroying Western Civilization, and causing all the former Catholics to join their church. This plan is either insanely stupid or surprisingly brilliant. It's insanely stupid because the villains were a small, breakaway faction of Catholicism with likely very little <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1som2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1som2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1som2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">read: absolutely zero, as they would be officially a schismatic group not in communion with the Church due to a number of delicts — heck, <em>Oral Roberts</em> would have more pull in the curia than these yahoos</span> actual power in the papal elections and therefore could not get Nightcrawler elected as pope, would require everyone in the Church to assume he is the Antichrist, and not, say, someone who replaced the pope, have these communion hosts <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2m9fj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2m9fj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2m9fj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which are actually produced in multiples of locations, not just in some central bakery in the Vatican, as Austen—sorry, <em>The Church of Humanity's</em> plan would depend on</span> distributed far and wide and not have anyone discover them, have Catholics spontaneously adopt the Rapture (as this is not part of Catholic Dogma, but originated in Protestantism<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yqtt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yqtt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yqtt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and not even just Protestantism at large, but a very narrow subset that emerged around 1890 or so</span>), and that this will cause the collapse of Western Civilization even though large swaths of Western Civilization don't practice Catholicism, that all the Catholics will spontaneously lose their faith including the more secular and non-practicing ones, and that all these ex-Catholics will join their church, rather than the hundreds of other faiths out there. The reason why it's potentially brilliant is that it reflects how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">cynically accurate</a> the reactions of the Marvel human population would be, and that having the Rapture really <em>would</em> cause problems because it would overturn a lot of previous dogma. If only they mentioned the latter bit.
</li><li> Also, the Rapture described in the story is what's referred to as a pre-tribulation Rapture, in which the Rapture is followed by a period of war, famine, death, etc. before Christ returns. In order for this plan to work, the villains in this story would need the resources to simulate both the tribulation and Christ's return to maintain believability. They obviously don't have these resources because then they could just kill the mutants directly instead of making the scheme, to begin with, and it would require doing a rather large case of blasphemy by <em>faking the return of Jesus Christ.</em>.
</li><li> <em>Exploding Communion hosts.</em> If they weren't shy about committing grave sacrilege on a mass scale (those nano-whoosie-whatsits they were going to seed the hosts with would have made them invalid matter and therefore <em>very</em> sacrilegious to use as Eucharist), somehow, it seems they'd have been sanguine about blasphemy as well.
</li><li> Also, the antichrist Nightcrawler was supposed to be mistaken for was from the pop culture version of a particular interpretation of Revelation - an interpretation, needless to say, not held by Catholicism in general, which considers that part of the book to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">thinly-veiled criticism of the Roman Empire.</a>
</li><li> The whole plan relies on the false assumption that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Christianity Is Catholic</a>.
</li><li> Some of the Bible quotes are wrong, and the word Revelation is even misspelled at one point.
</li><li> The Sacrament of Holy Orders (otherwise known as ordination) are wrong. It's actually a laborious four-to-eight-year process that involves going to seminary, leaving no time for any super-hero derring-do. And, no, the excuse that the Church of Humanity was shining Nightcrawler on or fooling him holds no water — he knew enough real priests to know how it works, and the info on the ordination process is public knowledge.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Chick Tracts</a></em> often do this to any religious ideology besides Jack Chick's own version of Christian fundamentalism (which is rather extreme, even for normal fundamentalism). When he does his research, it is usually from unreliable or discredited sources — sometimes even his own version of Christian fundamentalism. As a result, not everyone is convinced his works aren't an elaborate parody. It helps that he is so cryptic a person that absolutely nothing is known about him. Wikipedia even suggests that "Jack Chick" might have been the "pen name for an unnamed author or authors". Examples of Artistic License - Religious Studies from <em>Chick Tracts</em> include:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1074/1074_01.asp">Freemasons worship Baphomet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Putting aside that nobody has ever worshiped Baphomet <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4n9ut');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4n9ut" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4n9ut');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Baphomet is actually a phony pagan god that was invented as an excuse to prosecute the Knights Templar for devil worship. Some occultists used Baphomet as a symbolic representation (of God himself in most cases) but never worshiped it as an actual god. The name "Baphomet" does probably etymologically derive from "Mahomet" AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">the Prophet Muhammad</a>, but Muslims never worship anyone or anything other than God; "Baphomet" was just anti-Islamic propaganda.</span>, Freemasons tend to be Christians (but not Real, True Christians (TM) according to Jack Chick, of course). The only requirement to become a Freemason, in fact, is believing a higher power exists, though they don't get specific about it. The whole plot is a lazy imitation of the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax">Taxil Hoax<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where anti-Catholic French journalist Leo Taxil published a series of books with completely fraudulent and outrageous "exposés" about Freemasons to mock the Catholic Church's opposition to the group, including the claim that they worship Baphomet. Chick seems to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">taken Taxil at face value</a>, despite the fact that he confessed to making the whole thing up.
</li><li> His apparent belief that the Catholics have never heard of God or Jesus deserves a special mention. And for that matter, his apparent belief that there are actually people in Western society who have never heard of God or Jesus.
</li><li> More on Catholics:
<ul><li> Catholics worship the Virgin Mary <em>instead</em> of Jesus. They never worshiped Jesus. They worship Baal, who is not the Virgin Mary.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5qy23');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5qy23" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5qy23');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The contradiction between these things is never addressed.</span> He also believes that the Bible is against Catholicism because the Book of Revelation calls Babylon "The Great Whore." The passage he cites speaks of Babylon, and Jack Chick believes that Catholicism originated in Babylon, and more precisely, copied from Babylonian paganism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Never mind that early Christianity developed into Catholicism several centuries AFTER that book was written and that there are far likelier targets available</a>.

The reason it sounds convincing is that it's a half-truth: the pre-Islamic Arabs did house the idols of their gods at the Kaaba in Mecca, and Muhammad did throw them out when he took over. They also did worship "Allah" alongside their other gods before Muhammad threw out the idols, but that was because their religion was a syncretic mix of traditional polytheism, Judaism, and Christianity. They still worshiped the Abrahamic God, or at least a vague creator god similar to him, they just tacked on their own gods alongside him and created a new pantheon and mythology. Also, the lunar symbol Chick gets crazy about is just that, merely a symbol (probably left over from Persian times). It wasn't even adopted until well into the <em>1400s,</em> and even then it was controversial within the Muslim world. Green is more the Islamic symbol, but it's hard to spin that into hidden meanings. Also, the line right after is laughable:

</li><li> The evangelist tells the Muslim villain to "ask his mullah" why Ramadan begins and ends on the crescent moon, which the villain gets cagey about like its some esoteric secret. Any Muslim knows that Ramadan begins and ends on the crescent moon because it is supposed to last for exactly a month, i.e. one full cycle of the moon. Trying to derive some significance from that is like trying to say that Jewish people worship a moon god because the Sabbath starts and ends at sundown, or that Christians worship a sun god because they use a solar calendar.

A particularly egregious example is the 2011 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover">Bat Family Crossover</a> <em>Judgement on Gotham.</em> In this crossover, Azrael (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanSupportingCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/BatmanSupportingCast">Michael Lane</a>) teams with the Crusader, a superpowered psychotic, in order to destroy Gotham City, which they perceive as a modern-day Sodom/Gomorrah (It's later revealed that they were manipulated into doing this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a>, who apparently likes to play with Dominoes). In accordance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> story on the topic, however, they decide to instead first see if there is one righteous soul in the city. So, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">naturally</a>, they decide to test Batman (Dick Grayson), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> (Selina Kyle) and Red Robin (Tim Drake). If they find one righteous soul, they'll spare the city. Aaaaaaaandd here's where it fails. In the original Sodom and Gomorrah story, God agreed with Abraham to not destroy the cities for the sake of <em>ten</em> righteous people. This then begs the question of why Azrael and the Crusader didn't just take a poll of the local Christian churches. We the readers are then expected to believe that: 1.) The biggest "sin" that the Sword of Sin (a sword that when plunged into a person's body reveals to both the victim and the wielder the sins of the victim) could dredge up from Dick Grayson was not helping some random guy from the circus when he was a <em>kid</em>, as opposed to, say, fornication, lying, lustful thoughts, use of profanity etc. 2.) We are further expected to believe that Azrael and the Crusader sincerely think that they can find an individual without sin, which, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, yes, <em>the Bible</em>, is impossible with the sole exception of Jesus Christ (and his mother, Mary, as Azrael is Catholic, so he should know). 3.) In relation to point 2, we are then expected to believe that Tim Drake, who, as good a guy as he is, has lied, thought lustful thoughts, and used profane language, is "sinless." We are also expected to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Tim is pretentious enough to even think he has no sins, which he does think, according to his opening monologue</a>. 4.) We are then expected to believe that Selina Kyle, <em>Catwoman,</em> would fail the "sinless" test solely because she <em>wouldn't kill her sister "in the name of God"</em>, as opposed to her history of stealing, fornication, etc., this test <em>completely</em> violating every rule of Christianity. The reason it's so ridiculous is that the entire premise of this crossover relies on Azrael and Crusader, the former being a staunch Catholic from boyhood, being completely ignorant of the Bible's most basic principles, to the point that <em>Catwoman</em> knows more about Christianity than they do ("God and God alone can judge").

Some changes are made from the original Exodus story for the sake of drama.
<ul><li> In the original story, Moses was most certainly <em>not</em> a Prince. He was raised in Pharaoh's court, so he would have been considered nobility, but not royalty.
</li><li> Moses probably always knew that he was a Hebrew in the original story, whereas in this film he does not figure it out until around his adult life.
</li><li> In Exodus, Moses and Aaron are 80 and 83 years old, respectively, at the time of the plagues. While Moses is shown to have spent at least several years as a shepherd, he is still very much a young man when he confronts Rameses here.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8llva');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8llva" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8llva');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This change is probably due to the shorter lifespans on the Pharaohs' part—an 80-year old Moses would've been very unlikely to have confronted the same prince he grew up with. That said, the Pharaoh of the film is clearly meant to be Rameses the Great, who lived to be 90</span>
</li><li> Moses had Aaron actually deal with Pharaoh in the original story and also perform most of the miracles, in this version he does it all himself.
</li><li> Moses deliberately murdered the Egyptian guard whipping the slave and went so far as to try and hide the body. Here, the guard's death was a complete accident.
</li><li> The Bible never mentions Pharaoh's name, only ever referring to him by title. Historians do not agree on which Pharoah is most likely the one written of in Exodus. The film goes with Seti I as the Pharaoh who ordered the purge, and Rameses II as the Pharaoh at the time of the Plagues, which is one possibility, but not one considered very likely by most scholars. Judeah was actually part of Egypt at that time for one thing. There is no hard evidence for the story, quite particularly the Exodus.

<ul><li> The concept of Plenary Indulgence is portrayed completely wrong. Multiple characters who <em>should</em> know better (angels and a cardinal) describe it as a clean slate, and the forgiveness and removal of all sins. It is not. Plenary Indulgence is the removal of the need for temporal punishments of sins that have <em>already</em> been forgiven. It does not remove nor wipe out a person's sins. One might argue that Bartleby and Loki failing to understand the concept properly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">is part of the joke.</a> Also, Metatron calls himself a "Seraphim" and reveals two wings. The singular of "seraphim" is "Seraph," and they have six wings.
</li><li> Interestingly, a lot of the film's plot runs on the fact that Azrael, through Bartleby and Loki, is <em>intentionally</em> exploiting loopholes and using everyone's beliefs against them. The Cardinal is using the concept of Plenary Indulgences wrong, the whole "God is infallible" idea being proved incorrect has no basis in any official teachings, and half the stated rules and consequences happened (in-universe at least) centuries after the Bible began to be written.

<ul><li> Holy water is water that has been blessed by a priest. Chemically speaking, it's ordinary water. Sam Mraovich, however, believes that holy water is concocted through a recipe.
</li><li> The church, which is meant to be a strict fundamentalist Catholic church (so much so that the congregation protests about the <em>brother</em> of a gay man attending until he's forced from the church by a priest), takes the ideas of karma and negative energy seriously. Specifically, "negative energy" is a concept whose definition varies between esoteric groups, while "karma" is a belief found in religions whose origins stem from India (e.g. Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism). Neither concept is discussed in the Bible and you would be hard pressed to find any Christian denomination that teaches them.
</li><li> While Victor is clearly seen entering and leaving a Catholic church, much of what he espouses, especially regarding the need to be "saved", is more aligned with Protestant teachings.
</li><li> Upon fatally shooting Ben, Victor claims that killing him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulsavingCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulsavingCrusader">"saved his soul"</a>. If anyone in this film actually cared about real dogma, they'd realize killing Ben without giving him a chance to repent of his sins would be doing the opposite-putting it in great danger of damnation. Possibly justified in this case, seeing as Victor seems to have completely lost his mind at that point, so thinking logically wouldn't really be his strong suit.

Not to mention that baptism doesn't do jack to the possibility of being possessed. Its function is to prevent from being condemned due to the Original Sin and to allow a person to receive other sacraments. It should also be noted that in extraordinary circumstances (as in when a person is likely to die unbaptised and there is no priest around), baptism can also be performed by a lay Catholic.

Only the last part of Jules Winnfield's diatribe is (almost) the real verse, i.e.; "And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes, and they shall know that I am the LORD when I shall lay my vengeance upon them."
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SisterAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SisterAct">Sister Act</a></em>:
<ul><li> The film uses the terms "nun" and "sister" interchangeably, as in the title. In Catholicism, however, they're not the same thing: nuns live a life of contemplation while sisters engage in good works within their communities. All the nuns would have known the difference well before they took their vows, so it isn't a matter of them being afraid of getting involved with their community; it's simply not what they signed up to do. There is an even more basic difference; Nuns take 'Solemn Vows' and Sisters 'Simple Vows' basically the latter is easier to be dispensed from.
</li><li> The nuns are stated to be a Carmelite order. Carmelite nuns traditionally wear brown habits, often with a pure white veil and cloak. The nuns in <em>Sister Act</em> wear black habits associated with the Dominican orders (and even then, some Dominican nuns also wear pure white or white with a black veil). And even the habits are a bit of a moot point since, by the era of the film, most modern Western nuns just wore plain uniform dresses or street clothes paired with, at most, a veil. The fact that the nuns of <em>Sister Act</em> still wore full habits is more evidence that they were <em>nuns</em>, not sisters.
</li><li> There is also the problem of Whoopie being in full habit. While it's not impossible that nuns would give refuge to a woman in danger, they would under no circumstances dress her in the habit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stigmata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stigmata">Stigmata</a></em>: The film confuses the effects of being possessed by Jesus and by Beelzebub. It also features a desperate conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the existence of the newly-rediscovered Gospel of Thomas, which would apparently destroy the entire institution of religion if discovered. However, it was actually discovered in 1945, and published (and translated) shortly after with no opposition whatsoever.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KeepingTheFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KeepingTheFaith">Keeping the Faith</a></em> there is a scene where people in a synagogue are shown seated during kol nidrei, which would not happen in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine">Constantine</a></em> borrows symbols and names from Christianity, but that's where the similarities end.
<ul><li> A major plot point in the film is that, according to Catholic doctrine, people who commit suicide always go to Hell. In fact, the church teaches that while suicide is intrinsically evil, severe mental illness can reduce or even exclude moral culpability and that we "should not despair for the souls of those who take their own lives"(2283 of the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church). At least one of the suicides in the film was committed by a mental patient. Constantine's suicide is more complicated since suicide is only an unforgivable sin because you can't repent for it before you die. Constantine is brought back to life, so he can repent. However, as Constantine died and saw hell, he has <em>already</em> been condemned in the eyes of God. Also, as the concept of brain death has become better understood, there's been a serious debate in the Catholic community as to whether or not a person can commit suicide, and repent in the few seconds before the brain shuts down.
</li><li> When Constantine mentions the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearOfDestiny">Spear of Destiny</a>" and says "Jesus wasn't killed by crucifixion," the Catholic he's responding to replies with "I'm a Catholic, John. I know the Crucifixion story." Except in the Bible, Jesus <em>was</em> killed by crucifixion, and a spear was only used to poke his corpse to demonstrate he was already dead. There are people who think that Jesus was "really" killed by the spear, but those tend to be people who claim the Biblical account is <em>wrong</em>. No one would be able to teach the theory from the Bible, certainly not in Sunday School.
</li></ul></li><li> "If you believe in God, you must believe in the Devil..." proclaims the trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastExorcism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastExorcism">The Last Exorcism</a></em>. No, you don't. If this works at all, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilButNoGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilButNoGod">the other way</a>.
</li><li> Mrs. Carmody in the film adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMist">The Mist</a></em> was described as crazy within the film, but anyone vaguely familiar with Christian scripture or theology should have been able to make a pretty convincing argument against her, on her own terms. While the main characters criticize Mrs. Carmody's ravings that it's the Rapture (and that human sacrifice is required to appease God), at one point a tough biker-guy volunteers to go on an expedition outside: his parting shot was that for the record, he did believe in God, but thought Carmody was a lunatic. This contrast was all-too-brief because this man was killed shortly afterwards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Priest1994">Priest</a></em> (1994, dir. Antonia Bird) a major part of the plot involves a girl confessing that her father sexually abuses her, and the priest's (who also happens to be gay, just for the zeitgeist) subsequent attempts to protect her without breaking the Seal of the Confessional. This is incorrect according to the Canon Law of the Roman Church, but is commonly misunderstood (even by priests!): the seal applies only to confessed sins. The girl was not confessing a sin (her father raped her), and the priest was therefore not bound by the seal. Later, the father himself comes along to "confess" (actually to gloat). This is likewise not bound by the seal, as it applies only to genuine confessions - the father was gloating, not confessing, and was therefore not entitled to protection.
</li><li> Part of the massive backlash at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich">Roland Emmerich</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTwelve">2012</a></em> was how it perpetuated the belief of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Christians (and others) who have tried to connect the end date of the Mayan calendar with their own belief of Judgement Day. The Mayans never equated the end of their calendar with the end of the world. After all, the Georgian calendar "ends" on December 31st, and no one interprets that as the end of the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MayanMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MayanMythology">Mayan Mythology</a> had nothing resembling an apocalypse, ignoring the inherent absurdity of Christians looking to a non-Judeo-Christian source for their eschatology.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays">End of Days</a></em> a priest claims that the 666 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Revelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Revelation">Revelation</a> actually means 999, and therefore the end of the millennium since in dreams and visions writing and numbers may appear as mirror images or upside-down. Even if we agree to that, there is the problem that there is no way the writer of Revelation could have known about Arabic numerals, and if he did, at the time their visual appearance had not been developed to a point where 6 and 9 resemble each other that closely. Revelation explicitly says "six hundred and sixty-six", not "666"; and in Greek numerals that would be χξς, which doesn't look like anything upside down.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a></em> film series shares many of the problems with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em>, which it was derived from. For instance, in the third film, one character states that <em>all</em> Christians believe in the Rapture. This has more to do with their narrow definition of Christians (i.e. only people who believe as they do exactly). So people who don't believe in the Rapture are not Christians, according to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help">Help!</a></em> is sometimes erroneously taken to be an example of this trope, because it features the goddess Kaili which is "obviously" a misspelling of Kali. However, according to the DVD commentary, this was done deliberately to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>; they wanted a goddess who <em>sounded like</em> Kali without actually being her.

Humans are not angels and do not turn into them. Humans turn into saints, who are apparently conflated with angels because they both have haloes in popular art. The Mormons and Swedenborgians do believe some humans become angels, though they are the exceptions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonovansReef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonovansReef">Donovan's Reef</a>,</em> which takes place in French Polynesia, as the story of the Nativity presents the three magi as the king of Polynesia, the emperor of China, and the king of the United States of America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAbominableDrPhibes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAbominableDrPhibes">The Abominable Dr. Phibes</a></em> took liberties with the biblical Ten Plagues of Egypt, changing the nature of some and the order in which several occur. Re-scheduling the Plague of Darkness to come <em>after</em> the Death of the Firstborn is particularly jarring, considering the latter is what Exodus attests had scared the Pharaoh into setting Moses' people free, thus alleviating the <em>need</em> for any more.

There are around 2 billion Christians in the world (and around half of the world population if every Abrahamic religion is counted) and the Bible has actually been translated into either hundreds or thousands of languages depending on how you measure it.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFriscoKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFriscoKid">The Frisco Kid</a></em> features several inaccuracies about Judaism, ranging from the relatively trivial to the more significant:
<ul><li> After Harrison Ford's character shoots the fish the rabbi has been trying to catch, the rabbi exclaims, "If you had been here yesterday, we would have had fried chicken!" In kosher law, while a fish may be eaten regardless of how it was killed, birds and mammals may not be eaten unless they were slaughtered strictly according to the laws of <em>shechita</em>, which involve a quick severing of the animal's neck.
</li><li> The rabbi refuses to get on his horse on Shabbat, but he is seen pulling the horse with its reins, and traveling long distances by foot—both also forbidden activities on Shabbat.
</li><li> Shabbat ends at sundown/dusk, not sunset.
</li><li> The movie doesn't seem aware of a basic concept in Judaism called <em>pekuach nefesh</em>, the principle that nearly all the religious laws should be violated to save a person's life. He is seen repeatedly risking his life not to violate the Shabbat or see his Torah scroll be burned, and any rabbi would know he has no obligation to do such things, and that it's even considered a serious sin to endanger one's life for such purposes.
</li><li> While it's understandable that the rabbi would feel traumatized after being forced to kill someone in self-defense, he'd know perfectly well that it's entirely permitted in Judaism. The movie makes it sound like his religion has some absolute prohibition on killing under any circumstance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PainAndGain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PainAndGain">Pain and Gain</a></em>: When an observant Jew is asked if he's Jewish, he clarifies that he is "half Jewish." While nonobservant Jews with one Jewish parent often consider themselves "half Jewish" by descent, observant Jews always consider themselves simply to be Jewish.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence">Silence</a></em>: The film has Ferreira claim that the Japanese can't imagine anything beyond nature, thus they mistook "the Son" for the sun. Now, not only does this homonym make no sense in both Portuguese and Japanese where the words for this use entirely different sounds, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinto">Shinto</a> both definitely were based on notions of the supernatural. Possibly averted, though, in that this could just be a result of Ferreira's ignorance when it comes to Japan and Japanese religions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em>:
<ul><li> Van Helsing must kill Dracula to prevent the Valerious family from "passing into Purgatory" and thus never reaching Heaven. Yeah, except that, according to Catholic dogma, passing into Purgatory means eventually ending up in Heaven. The movie states that they would be stuck in Purgatory forever, because of a special deal that the original Valerious made.
</li><li> A friar isn't a lower degree of monk who hasn't leveled up to taking vows (that's a novice). Monks are members of monastic orders who profess the three vows (poverty, chastity, and obedience) and live in a cloistered ascetic community (like the abbey that Van Helsing says Carl has never left). Friars are members of mendicant orders who profess the three vows and live in the community at large, moving around as necessary to do their work. Carl's right, he's not a monk; but his brown habit and tonsure clearly mark him out as a Franciscan friar (Order of Friars Minor), which very definitely means a vow of chastity (though the way he says this to a woman implies that he's just taken advantage of her ignorance).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodsNotDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodsNotDead">God's Not Dead</a></em>: The filmmakers clearly do not understand Islamic views on women's dress. While some more conservative Muslims do think women should cover their faces, there is no way that Aisha would then wear a top that shows her bare arms and cleavage while also wearing a head covering.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SalvationBoulevard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SalvationBoulevard">Salvation Boulevard</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Jerry tries to justify his intended murder of Carl by citing the Bible where Abraham sacrifices Isaac. Carl incredulously points out that he totally missed the point-that Abraham <em>didn't</em> sacrifice Isaac, since the entire thing was just a test by God. Jerry doesn't listen, naturally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfWar">Lord of War</a></em>: Yuri states that his mother is Catholic. While not impossible, it is more likely that she would have been Orthodox, which was the majority faith of Christians in the Soviet Union and the Ukraine in particular (Catholics make up a small minority).
</li><li> <em>The Courage To Love</em> has a dramatic scene in where a newborn may soon die. As the priest wouldn't come quickly enough, the parents urge the midwife to baptize her, despite her saying she can't. In fact, it can be performed by a layperson (that's the only one that is allowed by the Catholic Church) specifically as such emergencies arise. This dates back to the Middle Ages. As the midwife is a Catholic, and they were often the ones doing this, she should know it can be done. She ends up doing so anyway, but this is treated like she's breaking the rules (in a good cause).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SeasonOfTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SeasonOfTheWitch">Season of the Witch</a></em>: The Catholic Church believes that demons can be exorcised with a single ritual, and no special, rare book is needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ladyhawke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ladyhawke">Ladyhawke</a></em>: Imperius is described as a monk, but his background reveals he used to take confessions. In real life, a monk has not taken Holy Orders and thus cannot take confessions - he would need to be a priest to be able to hear confession and give absolution (of course, it is possible to be both a monk and a priest, but you would be more likely to refer to yourself as a priest in the same way that someone with credentials as both a paralegal and a lawyer would probably not mention the paralegal part). However, this might be intentional, as Imperius is later revealed to have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> for committing the crime of betraying secrets of the confessional <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(or so he thinks)</span> - which hints he may have previously been a priest, only that he renounced his priestly vows and became a monk to repent, as it was done in the time and setting.

Of course, this isn't true, and it's also not plausible, as the two religions are quite different on some foundational levels.
</li><li> The main premise of <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> is that Islamic extremists are plotting to travel back in time and assassinate Jesus, thereby preventing Christianity from existing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Historical inaccuracies aside</a>, the terrorists' entire plan makes no sense from an Islamic perspective, given that Jesus is considered a major prophet in Islam and is held in reverence by most Muslims.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9pv02');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9pv02" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9pv02');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though not to the same extent as in Christianity.</span> It would be akin to a Christian extremist traveling back in time to assassinate Moses out of anti-Semitism.

<ul><li> The main conflict in the Hugo-winning science fiction novel <em>A Case of Conscience</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish">James Blish</a> depends entirely on the "fact" that the Catholic church rejects evolution. In fact, the Catholic Church (in the 1940s) said the theory and religion are not mutually exclusive and that the church has no problem with the theory. Compared to certain Protestant sects Catholicism has taken a very moderate stance on the controversy - they were originally neutral on the subject but later came down in favor of it (in fact, English Protestants both supported and rallied against the theory in more or less equal measure). The church made no official pronouncement about the subject at all until Pius XII adopted a neutral attitude. This is more a case of Theology Marches On than a pure example of this trope, but the central character is a Catholic priest who is freaked out by the existence of an alien species that appears to be without sin yet have never known Christianity: in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the Vatican issued a statement to the effect that it was definitely possible humanity would find such a species out there in the universe, and the idea of sinless aliens actually works within Catholic theology since they would not share Adam's curse.

Especially egregious considering that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P19.HTM">evolution is part of the Catholic catechism.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Or, you know, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor Mendel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>? That guy with peas who figured out the theory of genetics and was also an Augustinian friar. He not only had no objection to evolution, but wrote Darwin of his findings as evidence bolstering this. Unfortunately, it was lost in his voluminous correspondence, but rediscovery of Mendelian genetics helped to prove its validity.
</li><li> It's a pretty minor example, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em>, there are a couple of examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> basing his presentation of a god on Victorian-era interpretations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology">Slavic Mythology</a> instead of the original. One example is the idea of Bielbog being the "good god" brother of the "dark god" Czernobog. Modern evidence is that the former didn't actually exist in Slavic tradition. Probably justified <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as Bielbog is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">alternate personality</a> of Czernobog</span> in Gaiman himself admitting that he had sparse evidence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology">Slavic Mythology</a> and so had to use artistic license. There's also the issue that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Loki</span> is given some association with fire. This is the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLinguistics">a bad etymology</a>, most likely originating from the story where Loki ends up in a contest against Logi who is the personification of fire, and probably a bit of association of him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">Lucifer</a>.

K. Chesterton</a> contains an in-universe example, where an anarchist relates that he tried disguising himself as a bishop, but when he entered the drawing-room shouting "Down! Down! Presumptuous human reason!" people somehow figured out that he was an impostor since it seems real bishops don't act like that.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Stephen Bury</a> terrorism thriller <em>The Cobweb</em>, we encounter a Kosher butcher who's working <em>on a Saturday afternoon</em>. Aha! No kosher butcher would work on the Sabbath! Is he an impostor? An agent for the terrorists? ...nope. His Sabbath-desecration is not noticed, then or later, in the book. Maybe he's just a bad religious Jew? Who knows.
</li><li> John J. Miller's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> novel Death Draws Five is an over-the-top plot with various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Ministers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a>, which depends entirely on the fact that he did not research what Christians of ANY denomination actually believe concerning the Second Coming.
</li><li> <em>Mary Mae and the Gospel Truth</em> has a woman pull her daughter out of school because the mother believes fossils are fakes, and home schools Mary to teach her creation instead of evolution. What this outright ignores is that modern creationism does not reject that fossils exist, it merely rejects the belief that millions of years are required for them to form, citing some modern examples (like 70-year-old petrified teddy bears found in a cave) to justify belief that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood">rapid global flood</a> could do just as much damage in a year-and-a-half. But Fundamentalists being who they are and lacking a central authority, there probably are some who believe that fossils were made by Satan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> is very accurate in its portrayal of a very specific flavor of pre-millennial dispensationalists the writers belong to. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">Even if it is weird</a> to see the formerly non-believing protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">talk and behave like long-term believers instantly upon converting</a>.) Everyone else (from Catholics, Jews, and Atheists right up to competing pre-millennials) gets the shaft, badly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirEyesWereWatchingGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirEyesWereWatchingGod">Their Eyes Were Watching God</a>,</em> the people of Eatonville claim at one point that any romantic speech has to reference Isaac meeting Rebecca at the well. Rebecca met Isaac's family servant (usually said to be Eleazer) at the well, and Isaac and Rebecca's son Jacob met his future wife Rachel at a well, but Isaac and Rebecca's first meeting did not involve a well. Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">this was meant</a> to show the townspeople as being uninformed, as they're generally not the smartest bunch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em>, the climax of the trilogy hinges on the second Fall of humanity, in which it's prophesied that Lyra "will disobey" and thus become a "second Eve" (from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>). What she actually does is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fall in love and make out with Will.</span> She may have had sex, but even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on the subject is "maybe, maybe not," sometimes slanted more toward the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/12/1071125644900.html">not<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The issue is that if you leave out the sex between unmarried teenagers, there's nothing in her actions that the Bible considers sin or "disobeying" at all. Even that may not be a sin since it's supposed to happen prior to another Fall— Adam and Eve are implied to have had sex before the theft ("be fruitful and multiply" and all that).
<ul><li> And then, of course, there is the statement that Catholicism has literally stood in the way of every single scientific and technological advance in history and that these advances had to be 'snatched' from them at every turn. Never mind the fact that the actual first book of the series revolved around some nasty scientific experiments conducted for the Church, meaning that statement isn't even accurate <em>in-universe</em>, the truth is that the real-life Church has been funding science since before it was actually <em>called</em> science, and still does. The long story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity">is here under science</a>, but the short version is that they own at least two scientific institutes—<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences">the Pontifical Academy of Sciences<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the extremely venerable <a class="urllink" href="http://vaticanobservatory.org/">Vatican Observatory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and fund many more. The idea that they have ever opposed, or even disliked, science is a total myth. These are the guys who accepted evolution as soon as they had deemed there was sufficient evidence to support it (in about 1942).

Also, in a more nitpicky example, he claims that the five-pointed star symbol of the Gatekeepers has "nothing to do with Christianity", which isn't strictly true—a few examples of early Christian artwork do use a similar five-pointed star as a symbol of Christ. It would still be a bit odd to find it carved on a secret door in the Vatican, but it wouldn't be as unbelievable as the book implies. The Incan tumi given to Richard is described as having a sharp point. Tumis do not have points; the blade is semicircular.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHammerAndTheCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHammerAndTheCross">The Hammer and the Cross</a></em>, Harry Harrison introduces Thor as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse god of smiths</a>, something very much not within the historic Thor's domain. He needed a god of blacksmithing, and the Norse simply didn't have one: the closest approximation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/WaylandTheSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/WaylandTheSmith">Wayland</a>, being highly inappropriate for the modified Norse religion that forms the core of the story.

It's about on par with saying a Japanese Christian cannot eat ramen anymore because they believe in Jesus. The connection is simply not there.
</li><li> In <em>The Love and Death of Caterina</em> by Andrew Nicoll, a Roman Catholic priest prays in his room to <em>saint</em> Maximilian Kolbe and then performs the sacrament of extreme unction according to the old rites. Extreme unction was changed into annointing of the sick (and the whole rite changed) in 1972, while Kolbe was canonized in 1982. If the priest was praying to <em>servant of God</em> Kolbe, that would be fine.

Quite apart from the fact that we know almost nothing about them (well they <em>were</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">mystery</a> cult), a lot of what we do know contradicts many of the claims made on the show (and by many others besides the QI researchers). Sorry QI, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">you fail history</a> and religious studies forever. This plays into a lot of common arguments that much of Christianity's stories are based upon common aspects of pagan mythology. While it is possible to draw comparisons between the book of Genesis and other religious texts, it is generally false to claim that aspects of Christianity are based on earlier religions and folklore. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity">Artistic License  Traditional Christianity</a> for more details.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> and its portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca">Wicca</a> can certainly qualify, such as stating the Wiccan Rede to be "no personal gain" rather than "harm none" and completely disregarding Wicca's theology involving a Goddess and God, instead focusing on a completely made up cosmology involving beings such as the Elders and Whitelighters. It's more like watered-down Christianity than anything else.
<ul><li> Most of the actual Wiccans who turn up on the show are made to look silly. And the dialogue keeps using "Wiccan" as just a synonym for "witch". The "witches" in CHARMED mythology have little resemblance to either legendary witches or contemporary crafters. One can use "low" magic without adhering to the Gardnerian construct of "Wiccan" religion, and one can accept the religion without being an initiated "witch".
</li><li> A particularly bad case was the episode about the warlock/deacon, which only made sense by claiming that ordination as a priest would somehow confer additional "protection" against evil magic. . . especially as deacons are already in Holy Orders.
</li><li> The (allegedly) Wiccan ancestor in question was from Salem at the time of the witch trials, which makes this an explicit example of the very common misconception that Wicca is (a) an ancient religion, and (b) just the "polite" term for any sort of European paganism other than Norse or Greco-Roman. And she was burned in Salem. Anyone who frequents TV Tropes knows the drill: convicted witches were <em>hanged</em> in Salem, not burned (one man was pressed to death for refusing to plead to the charges).

<ul><li> The fact that vampires view the original Good Friday as the best day for them, as it was the Crucifixion. It is, however, fundamentally wrong from a theological perspective (not that you'd expect vampires to know anything about theology anyway...). After all, Christians view the Crucifixion as a necessary step to the Resurrection, which opened the gates of Heaven to humankind, something vampires have been denied when they were turned... <em>Oops.</em>
</li><li> The show portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca">Wicca</a> as a way to get magick powers rather than as a religion; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when Willow ran into a realistic Wicca coven in college and was annoyed with it by the lack of spell casting.

You know, nowadays every girl with a Henna tattoo and a spice rack thinks she's a sister to the Dark Ones.
</div><ul><li> An early episode also featured a group of vampires celebrating the feast of St. Vigeous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatronSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatronSaint">Patron Saint</a> of vampires. One wonders how a saint dedicated to demonic predators was canonised in the first place, but presumably, it's just their name for him, or maybe vampires have their own religion, including saints?
</li><li> Actually, and this may surprise, there is a patron saint of vampires - however, it is a very obscure story and deals with the saint killing the vampire, meaning one would invoke him to protect yourself from vampires.
</li></ul></li><li> Any time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> goes near religion.
<ul><li> A girl in the pilot episode claims the pentacle is a Satanic symbol, but the trope is subverted when Sam corrects her by explaining the various other meanings ascribed to the symbol.
</li><li> Check out any episode where they talk about the old pagan gods; the show just uses the term 'Pagan God' for any "god" of an old polytheistic religion, as if all the thousands of polytheistic religions were all a monolithic, united religion known as "Paganism." They specifically say the Trickster exists in Norse and Egyptian mythology, and that the Vanír were Norse gods, too.
</li><li> The fourth season deals with our heroes trying to make sure that at least "66 of 666 seals" keeping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> remain in place since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a> says that this will begin the Apocalypse. One problem: there is nothing about "66 of 666 seals" anywhere in Revelation, it's something made up to provide an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">episode-to-episode conflict</a> for the 20+ episode season.
</li><li> An angel scold the boys for believing that the Antichrist will be the son of Satan. "Your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a> gets more wrong than it does right," he explains. Except... the Bible never describes the Devil having any children and it also fails to mention a singular figure called "the Antichrist." The former is a piece of popular folklore and the latter is a name applied to the two Beasts described in the final book of the New Testament. You'd think an angel would know better.
</li><li> Samhain, that demon in "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Samhain is actually the Celtic Sabbath that falls on Halloween, and it's pronounced SOW-EHN, not SAM-HANE. Please, if you're going to insult every Celtic witch out there, at least do it right, and it becomes even more obvious when you realize that "Samhain" is also the Irish word for "November", so it wouldn't exactly be difficult to check the pronunciation...
</li><li> According to <em>Supernatural</em>, if an angel falls from grace they become human, but according to Christian theology, if an angel falls from grace then they become a demon. Hence the term "fallen angel". This is probably based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingsOfDesire">Wings of Desire</a></em>, which features an angel who falls from heaven to become the human lover of a woman.
</li><li> Despite having a two-season arc where the forces of Heaven and Hell conspire to make the events of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a> happen, the Second Coming of Jesus isn't even referenced, despite the fact that the entire point of the Revelation is that the whole Apocalypse serves as a sign of the coming and final judgment of Christ. Reasons for this notable absence include the secular leanings of the writers, the strong effect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo">Jesus Taboo</a>, and the difficulty of aligning the show's antagonistic take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a> and the popular notion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool">Jesus Was Way Cool</a>.
</li><li> Sam, in order to create purified blood, confesses one particular sin (as he sees it) in an empty confessional booth. Reconciliation (the sacrament) involves going to an actual priest, reciting a specific prayer, confessing <em>all</em> sins, and doing some sort of penance, <em>none</em> of which Sam does. It's implied that he does something similar to prayer, which, while very nice, isn't the same thing as reconciliation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DefyingGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DefyingGravity">Defying Gravity</a></em> has an episode in which Paula, a devout Catholic, proclaims the discovery of aliens as a sign of the upcoming Rapture. As stated above, the Rapture is <em>not</em> Catholic doctrine. Possibly justified, however, if she has just picked up on pop cultural Protestant beliefs. Plus, it's in the future.

<ul><li> The worst example was probably the laughably bad portrayal of Judaism in "Kaddish", but attempts to portray <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a>'s Catholicism or any other forms of Christianity tended to run headlong into the writers' total lack of research.
</li><li> And Voodoo, and Wicca, and their conflation of Satanism and (Aleister Crowley's) Thelema, which had nothing to do with real-world Satanism or Thelema.
</li><li> A more specific example: in the episode "3", a character writes "John 52:54" on a wall, and Mulder is immediately able to bring the verse to mind. Problem is, it's actually "John 6:52-54" he's thinking of, and "John 52:54" doesn't exist.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> serial "The Daemons" implied that Beltane was a night for evil spirits when it, in fact, was a day for purification, transition, and fertility rituals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>
<ul><li> The first episode written by Kathy Reichs had "Wiccans" who were all-female, descended from the Salem "witches," and who stole corpses and used bat bones in their ceremonies. Even though the corpse stealer was portrayed as a blasphemer that did curses for hire and was feared and pitied by the less <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> deliberately</span> psychotic Wiccans, the rest still fails.
</li><li> It also claimed (through Sweets) that the pentagram is an Ancient Wiccan Symbol signifying solidarity and sisterhood. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Sumer, Pythagoras, and Agrippa would like to have a word with you.</a> The symbol has not only been used by pagans but also <em>Christians</em> before its modern use by Satanist groups tainted it for them.
</li><li> In episode 10 of the 5th season, Daisy repeatedly claims that it was more likely that Jesus was born in March than December, and that early Christians celebrated his birth in that month. It's long been debated when Jesus was born, for both month and year (or, in some cases, whether or not there even <em>was</em> a historical Jesus), but no evidence is offered that early Christians celebrated it in March. On the contrary, all evidence suggests they celebrated it in December (as for whether or not that was when he was actually born, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseTraditionalChristianity">Artistic License  Traditional Christianity</a>) and his <em>conception</em> in March (Feast of the Annunciation).
</li></ul></li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, Piz starts ranting on his radio show about how even though he is a Catholic schoolboy, the concept of Purgatory completely baffles him. He then goes on to completely incorrectly explain it as the place for people not good enough for Heaven (a common misconception among non-Catholics and Catholics alike, so maybe this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>?). Purgatory is the place of purification for souls on their way to Heaven in which the temporal effects of their sins are cleansed.
</li><li> Then there's that episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> where Mr. Eko tells Claire that the dove that appeared after Jesus' baptism signified that John had cleansed Jesus of his sins. Actually, being the Son of God, Jesus was sinless, and the Dove was another way that God claimed Jesus as his son. This can partially be explained by Eko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not being a real priest, but actually a drug runner who caused the death of his brother (who was an actual priest) then became a "priest" to atone for this.</span> Guess he didn't have much time to learn theology...

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> a priest, who's supposed to be an experienced exorcist, immediately jumps to the conclusion that a girl was possessed because she had been having mood swings. He later then shows up to perform an exorcism on another girl without even taking any steps to find out if she was really possessed (i.e. sending her to a doctor or a psychologist, or even just interviewing her himself). Sadly, this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> if we're talking about clergy from some of the flakier Charismatic or Fundamentalist <em>Protestant</em> sects, some of whom will do exorcisms at the drop of a hat. But a Roman Catholic priest? Either he's a little loopy himself and/or acting without any official authority, in which case he'd get in big trouble with both secular and ecclesiastical authorities. This very same thing happens in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICrimeSceneInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICrimeSceneInvestigation">CSI</a></em>. The team investigates a girl's death during an exorcism. The church performing the exorcism turns out to be made entirely of the exorcist and a handful of followers.
</li><li> On the TV miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roots1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roots1977">Roots (1977)</a></em>, the people in Kunta Kinte's village are shown to be Muslim, and the women of the village walk around topless. The problem is that if the women were Muslim, they would certainly not be topless in public. The only specific command in the Qur'an about female modesty is that they must cover their breasts (it's probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a>). They could be less-observant Muslims (actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">fairly common</a> for West African Muslim peoples far from the region's great cities).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteriousWays">Mysterious Ways</a></em> episode "29," a man sees the number 29 drawn by a toy pendulum during an earthquake and believes the apocalypse will occur on the 29th of the month, as the number 29 is always associated with disaster. Among the reasons he gives is "Many people believe Christ died at 29." Not only is Christ's death the <em>opposite</em> of a disaster, in Christian theology, but <em>no one</em>, or close to it, believes Christ died at 29. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ad8s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ad8s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ad8s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=christ+died+at+29&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">Google it for yourself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span> The most common age suggested is 30 or 33. Miranda's reaction (an annoyed "'Many people'?") possibly suggests that the error is the character's, not the writers'.
<ul><li> There's also an in-universe case in the series finale "Something Fishy," in which fish rain from the sky onto a small town. One of the town's residents tries to explain the spiritual significance, but mixes up Bible stories as he does so, leading to tales of God punishing Pharaoh for not believing Noah (followed by Noah escaping the Parting of the Red Sea in his ark) and "mana from Heaven sent to the Israelites in the belly of the whale."

In their eyes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">"Wiccan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">priestess"</a> on the show was pretentious, irresponsible, and utterly immoral. It goes without saying that while every religion abhors murder, using magic (considered a sacred gift from the God and Goddess) to murder someone is beyond blasphemy. The characters consider the religion of Wicca and the practice of witchcraft as interchangeable (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">this mistake is made in real life too</a>) and have very dismissive opinions on it. Rigsby even goes so far as calling it an "alternative lifestyle like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> or yoga". While it could be seen that the "priestess" was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">attention-seeking girl with no understanding of the faith she claimed to follow</a>, viewers were not shown any contrast to this image, which is essential in portraying something that most viewers know little to nothing about.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em> claimed that a mortar and pestle are used in "Satanic rituals." Maybe, but it's more commonly used in gourmet cooking to grind spices and herbs, herbalism to mill herbs, compounding pharmacy to custom-create drugs, recreational pharmacy to mill "herbs," and millions of other uses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">And the investigator immediately jumped to "Satanism."</a>

<ul><li> The episode "Minimal Loss" deals with a hostage situation involving an isolated, self-sustaining religious commune that is similar to the real incidents at Waco and others, states the group had begun as libertarians, before turning religious-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">because, of course, "Libertarians aren't religious."</a> Uh, no-many libertarians <em>are</em>, though granted, the movement itself is not religious. While a group could go from being libertarian to authoritarian regardless of having religious beliefs or not, the scenario the episode lays out seems pretty unlikely, to shift from libertarian community to apocalyptic cult.
</li><li> In another episode, "Perennials," the suspect believes himself to be the reincarnation of a serial killer who died the day he was born, in the same hospital, and is killing the people he believes are reincarnations of the dead killer's victims, placing fly larvae by their bodies in the belief that it will make their souls be reborn into these instead of humans, so ending the cycle. Morgan states that "See, a fundamental tenet of reincarnation is that you can come back in any life form, not just human." Wrong-in some reincarnation beliefs, such as Hindus', this is true-others like the Druze, though, believe people are only reborn in human bodies, not animals. They also differ on whether people can be reborn into different sexes than they had before.

Although his character is (like him) a Catholic, the brand of Christianity he seems to follow appears to have more in common with the kind of apocalyptic Evangelical Protestantism that the right-wing pundits he parodies follow. This is evidenced by the fact that he keeps referring to the Rapture as though he believes it, when in fact it is most emphatically <em>not</em> Catholic doctrine. One suspects that this is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">intentional joke for people who know their Catholic doctrine</a> — which Colbert certainly does, seeing as he teaches Catholic Sunday School and is quite well-educated more generally.

Initially, it's only her skin color that's a topic of debate (because of the possible repercussions for Peter's campaign), but later she is mentioned to be the daughter of a Hamas-sympathizing Muslim cleric, which basically rolls three separate unlikely scenarios into one. A Muslim girl not wearing a scarf? Progressively more unlikely the more conservative the family gets. A Muslim girl allowed to have a boyfriend before marriage? Progressively more unlikely the more conservative the family gets. A Muslim girl allowed to have a <em>nonbeliever</em> as a boyfriend? Unlikely even for moderately Muslim families. All of the above at once, with the father in question being the aforementioned Hamas-sympathizing cleric?

</li><li> The pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonekickers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonekickers">Bonekickers</a></em> focuses around the discovery of the true cross, and the villain planning to use this proof of Christ's existence to drive the Muslims into a holy war. Apparently, nobody bothered to tell him that Muslims do believe that Jesus existed, just that he wasn't God. From the way the episode is framed, it doesn't seem like the writers were intentionally setting him up as an idiot. However, as Muslims believe Jesus didn't actually die on the cross, it still might go some way to causing problems if this were proven.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander">Outlander</a></em>:
<ul><li> Although Charles Edward Stuart is correctly portrayed as a Catholic, raised in Italy, the Scottish were not still mostly Catholic at this point. Scotland had been majority Reformed Presbyterian all the way back to John Knox in the 1560s. Thus, the talk of the "heretic" Hanoverians is pretty far off. The difference in religion was the least of the Scottish concerns at the time. This series seems to underline that most Scots still are Catholic by faith (Jamie, for instance, is constantly crossing himself). In reality, it was only the Highland clans who were still Catholics (and not surprisingly make up the bulk of Jacobites). The series doesn't make this clear.
</li><li> Moreover, not all the Highlanders were Catholic. Clan Campbell, one of the largest and most famous of all the Scottish clans, was firmly Protestant, as were several others.
</li><li> In "Providence" Roger meets Father Alexandre Ferigault, who's a French Catholic priest held captive by the Mohawk because he offended them in not performing baptism on his son. He tells Roger that is Catholic doctrine as he's not in a state of grace, due to violating his vows by conceiving the boy. This is wrong though. Catholic doctrine is that a sacrament stays valid regardless of the spiritual state of the person who performs it, because in their belief it's God, not the human being who has done it. The opposite view, called Donatism, is actually condemned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics">heresy</a> by the Church.
</li><li> The Mohawk people in the show are depicted as being unfamiliar with Christianity and the doctrine of the religion. In reality the Haudenosaunee as a whole had known of Christianity for well over 150 years by this point, and had had many dealings with missionaries already. A significant number would already have converted.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1997 miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ivanhoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</a></em> it's said the sacrament of penance (i.e. absolution) can only be received once in a person's lifetime. Whoever wrote that clearly didn't know even the most basic facts of Catholicism at all. There's no limit, and in fact shortly after this is set the Church actually <em>mandated</em> people have the sacrament at least once a year because many had been neglecting it. Heresy trials didn't really occur yet at the time either by the Church, so the forced baptism of a Jew (itself not considered valid) so he can then be tried for this over rejecting Christ would not work.

Darwyn beats them up and then delivers a lecture pointing out that traditionally Muslims have actually been <em>enemies</em> of Sikhs, with conflict going back centuries. He also notes multiple times that Muslim terrorists twist real Islamic teachings to justify themselves, which disgusts him.

However, in Catholic belief many Apostles and later saints healed the sick miraculously too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed">Cursed</a></em>: While this is a parallel universe, the culture does also seem intended to be based on that of early medieval Europe. Thus, some departures from real world medieval Catholicism are noteworthy:
<ul><li> The Red Paladins, a Catholic order of warrior monks, are portrayed as crucifying Fey and then burning them alive on the crosses. Historically, Christians considered imitating Christ by even letting <em>themselves</em> ever be crucified abhorrent. It was something to be avoided if at all possible. Thus, according to tradition, Peter was crucified upside down at his request (with an upside down cross becoming a symbol of the Pope afterward because of it). Similarly, Andrew was said to be crucified on an X-shaped cross (such a symbol is now called the St. Andrews cross after his name). While not impossible attitudes differ in another world, this would be more likely viewed as blasphemous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burning at the stake was generally used</a> against "enemies of God" like heretics and supposed witches, similar to the Fey in their view here. Fey here are burned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">and</a></em> crucified.
</li><li> Father Carden believes that the Weeping Monk can be saved, despite being Fey. Yet other Fey never receive a chance for this-Carden specifically says no mercy must be given to them. While that might make sense if they're perceived as irredeemable demons, it also contradicts what he claims. This could be viewed as simply Carden's own bigotry, but this stance is portrayed as having the <em>Pope</em>'s sanction, which goes against the Catholic doctrine, which says any person (non-humans were in fact discussed by theologians at times) must be given an opportunity to accept Christianity. Human pagans also seem to be killed without mercy like Fey, rather than at least attempts at converting them being made.

At one point they sing, "As God has shown us by turning stones to bread; that we all must lend a helping hand". They apparently confused the temptation of Jesus, in which Satan tries to convince Jesus to turn stone to bread and end his fast, with Exodus, in which God causes nourishing manna to fall from the sky to feed the Israelites, or with the Miracle of Loaves and Fishes, in which Jesus asked one follower to share his lunch with over five thousand others, and they ended up with twelve baskets of leftovers, proving that a little kindness goes a long way.

And no, if any, Christian denominations use a "prayer guide" during services, although some use a Book of Common Prayer.

<ul><li> The game's portrayal of European Christianity in starts before 1066 is the source of arguments over whether it's appropriate to have Catholicism and Orthodoxy be separate denominations before the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93West_Schism">Great Schism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (when the Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch excommunicated each other in 1054). Truth is, it's hazy: while in the earliest starts particularly they were officially considered the same church, there were already differences in practice and doctrine such as autocephalous national Orthodox churches<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12huxv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12huxv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12huxv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Essentially each nation's highest cleric pays homage to the Ecumenical Patriarch but in practice governs his own independent hierarchy.

</li><li> Outside of Christianity, the game conflates Germanic paganism with Norse paganism (they were related but distinct, especially at the early start dates). It should be noted that the religion used to be called "Norse" until the <em>Charlemagne</em> DLC, which added a start date set in 769 and the pagan kingdom of Saxony in Germany. The devs preferred to merge both religions rather than create two separate ones, one which would be exclusive to a startdate and in a singular region in Germany.
</li><li> The Yazidis are considered a Sunni heresy in game, despite being completely distinct and independent of Islam in real life. The same issue is present for Manichaeism, which is implemented as a heresy of Zoroastrianism rather than a separate faith. To mitigate this somewhat, Yazidism gets its own set of holy sites and unique creation conditions for its equivalent to the caliph. <em>Jade Dragon</em> likewise gives Manichaeism and other Zoroastrian heresies its own mechanics.
</li><li> On the flip side, Bön is implemented as an organized, pagan religion distinct from the Dharmic/eastern religious branch and counts Buddhists as heathens. While real-life Bön do claim the religion is older than Buddhism's arrival in Tibet, in practice there is no evidence of its existence prior to the 11th century and its current-day incarnation is so intertwined with Buddhist rituals and thought so as to make it more of a Buddhist sect than a distinct religion.
</li><li> With <em>Jade Dragon</em>, the absence of Confucianism/Neo-Confucianism is somewhat noticeable, especially as the entire system of Chinese Meritocracy (which <em>is</em> present in-game) is based on its precepts. All Chinese characters are instead Taoist. This is most likely because creating <em>two</em> new religions entirely for the purpose of an off-screen faction (neither really caught on outside China) would be excessive.
</li><li> The portrayal of the Messalians as not only allowing, but encouraging incest, and having Lucifer listed as one of their Good gods. These are based on claims made by people who were denouncing the sect, who also claimed that they would then take any child born of incest and offer it to Satan, after which they would <em>eat it</em>. Modern scholars agree that these accusations are false.
</li><li> African Paganism is the in-game representation of the paganistic native beliefs of several ethnic groups living in modern-day Niger and Chad, including the Mandé, Hausa and Songhai people. Its selection of deities as of <em>Holy Fury</em> includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Anansi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo">Vodun</a> patrons, which are features of native religions from the Gulf of Guinea some ways away. This geographical distance applied to Europe would mean the Bolghars (early-game Tengri pagans in modern-day Romania and Bulgaria) would be able to worship Odin and Ukko.

<ul><li> Qarmatian characters can take the Hajj, even though the Qarmatians were an Islamic sect that considered the Hajj to be based in superstition and even attacked the pilgrimage routes. This is fixed in 1.1 for both them and Alawites.
</li><li> "Ash'arism" is the largest and most dominant Sunni Islam faith in-game. It exists in the 867 start even though it was founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari (which the school lends its name from) in the year 936.
</li><li> Norse paganism (Ásatrú) starts out more openly hostile to homosexuality than Christianity ("criminal" as opposed to "shunned"): While little mention of it exists in the mythical writings, historical records describes homosexuality in terms similar to that found in Greek or Roman writings (i.e. homosexuality was entirely acceptable as long as you were the top, and while being the bottom was considered unmanly it wasn't a crime to be one). It also proclaims witchcraft a crime, despite having a magical tradition known as "seid" which was considered divine (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">only practicable by women</a>).
</li><li> For that matter, Catholicism didn't begin actively persecuting witches until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">the end-date of the game</a>: Official Catholic Canon between the 11th and 15th centuries was that there were no such things as 'witches' or 'magic' and anyone believing in either was a heretic, a pagan, or mentally ill.

Lucifer (Pride) and Satan (Wrath) are replaced by Samael and <em>the Sphinx</em>, respectively. Sloth has no demon associated with it, due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being represented by the people of Tokyo as a whole</span> and the game features an 8th sin in the form of Vanity, which gets its own demon, Azazel.

<ul><li> One episode had Flanders do some home television, reenacting Cain's murder of Abel. Then his kids asked how there came into being more humans when Cain and Abel were the only two humans (followed by asking whether or not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction">Cain and Abel had children with each other</a>). Flanders has a snide remark with the implication that the kids shouldn't be reading too much into it (an indication he doesn't really know). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> makes it clear that Adam and Eve later had other children so they weren't the only two humans; the first one was named Seth. Cain is also explicitly stated to have had a wife while in the Land of Nod/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15rg64');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15rg64" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15rg64');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The phrasing makes it ambiguous as to whether he was just wandering east of the Land of Eden or went to an actual place named the Land of Nod.</span> While where <em>they</em> came from isn't made clear, this trope is in effect because Flanders's kids asked if Cain and Abel had sex with each other and produced children that way, and Flanders never corrected them.
</li><li> In another episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E8LisaTheSkeptic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E8LisaTheSkeptic">Lisa the Skeptic</a>", somebody digs up what appears to be the skeleton of a winged human. Immediately nearly everybody in town believes that the skeleton belongs to an angel. Lisa, as the title would suggest, is the only person to suspect it's fake. All of the other people in town, including Reverend Lovejoy, criticize her for lack of faith. Except that, according to Christian tradition, angels do not have physical bodies and cannot die. Plus, their depiction as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> comes from artwork, whereas the Bible describes them as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">utterly inhuman appearances</a> when it describes them at all. Therefore even those who believe in angels, <em>especially</em> the minister and the deeply religious Mr. Flanders, should have called it out as a fake from the beginning.
</li><li> When Homer and Bart convert to Catholicism in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E21TheFatherTheSonAndTheHolyGuestStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E21TheFatherTheSonAndTheHolyGuestStar">The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star</a>", Marge is given a glimpse of Catholic Heaven (with Mariachi, Pinatas, spaghetti dinners, Irish pubs, Riverdance, and drunken fist fighting) and Protestant Heaven (portrayed as a boring country club with badminton and croquet, and everyone talking in vaguely East Coast accents). At one point it's revealed that Jesus himself has been hanging out in Catholic Heaven a lot, leading one of the Protestants to cluck, "He's gone native" - which would suggest that Jesus is a Protestant, despite living 1,500 years before Protestantism existed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Which is the joke.</a>
</li><li> In the episode "Today I Am A Clown", Krusty is under the impression that not having had a Bar Mitzvah celebration means he is not Jewish. At the age of 13, a Jewish male is expected to have been educated enough to be personally responsible for following the commandments. Whether or not the coming of age is marked by a ceremony makes no difference to the status of being a boy or man, let alone being fully Jewish or not at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> episode "Rapture's Delight," Stan expects the Rapture despite being an Episcopalian. The whole episode follows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> by overdramatizing even the already overdramatized ideas perpetuated by things such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> books. A lot of stuff doesn't match up with even the most rudimentary aspects of Rapture belief.
<ul><li> It strange that this one church Stan happens to go to apparently has the power to ban people from ALL of Christianity including different forms, branches, and sects of Christianity. Which isn't even remotely possible.
</li><li> In fact, the whole episode falls in this categories (seriously you can have a drinking game with the number of examples this one episode provides). For example, why would the weapons that are needed to kill the Antichrist be at the Vatican, when the Antichrist isn't even Catholic doctrine? Another example would be that Stan was not allowed to enter the Vatican because he is no longer a Christian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Yeah that's right, non-Christians are not allowed to enter this Catholic building</a> when in real life anyone can enter the Vatican, even in restricted areas, so long as you buy a ticket. Also, the Bible never talks about Satan having children (though it's been a popular folk idea). And to top it all off, at the end we see the Antichrist sporting the upside down cross, even though it's not really a Satanic symbol (while it's true that most people don't know this, but one would assume that the Antichrist of all people would know). In fact, an inverted cross is the symbol of the <em>pope</em>, after the legend in which St. Peter (traditionally viewed as the first pope) was crucified upside down so his death would not resemble Christ's (though to be fair, a mainstream Christian belief about the occult is that any corruption of a symbol is occultic, hence why simply putting a circle around the Star of David makes it evil, as it is a corruption of the original intent, according to this belief. Things like Black Sabbaths and reversed citations of the Lord's Prayer are such corruptions). It even appears on the Papal throne. It's even been taken by anti-Catholic Christians to be a sign that the Pope is the Antichrist, making this doubly ironic. This also raises the question of why would the Vatican even care if a Protestant (a person from a completely different branch of Christianity) is banned from there.

<ul><li> Played for laughs in the "Jewbilee" episode. Judaism is portrayed as the worship of Moses, who takes the form of the Master Control Program from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a></em> and has an obsession with children's arts and crafts. Haman, from the Book of Esther, is portrayed as a demonic creature that is worshiped by the denomination of Anti-Semitic Jews. Since Matt Stone is half-Jewish, it's obvious this all falls under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
</li><li> In "Cartmanland", Kyle's parents try to restore his faith in God by reading him the story of Job, but stop at the point where Job is stricken with boils, declaring that to be where the story basically ends. The account of Job actually ends with Job gaining a new family and twice the amount of wealth he had lost (unsurprisingly, Kyle's faith is not restored).
</li><li> The episode "Probably" featured everyone going to Hell except for Mormons. Mormons believe that only the truly wicked go to Hell (called "Outer Darkness") and not because they were not Mormon. However, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> universe, Hell is only bad if you were a bad person, otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime">it's not that bad</a>. The Mormons go to Heaven so they don't ruin Hell for everyone else. Saddam's going to Heaven (with the Mormons) is actually depicted as <em>punishment.</em>
</li><li> At the end of the "Cartoon Wars" arc, the Muslim terrorists produce their own animated film to get back at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode. The film depicts Jesus, along with many Americans crapping incessantly on each other. In reality, Muslims have no contempt for Jesus. In fact, Jesus is known as one of the most important prophets, second only to Muhammed, just not the savior. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Of course, they could just be making fun of Americans' worship of him</a>.

<ul><li> Peter's father Francis, a devout Catholic, backhandedly compliments Peter's (Protestant) wife Lois by telling her "Maybe you won't go to hell; maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies!" Francis should certainly be aware, but purgatory is a temporary place of purification for those who are destined for heaven but still need to undergo punishment for sins committed in life. Limbo is supposedly a permanent residence for those who cannot enter heaven and do not deserve hell, i.e. unbaptized infants and righteous people who died before Jesus. Also, purgatory is an established Church doctrine, but limbo is not (though a good number of Catholics do believe in it.)
</li><li> Peter's entire conception of the Jewish religion in the "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" episode revolves around stereotypes about their skill with money and mathematics. Apparently, their justification was that much of what Peter knows about his own Catholic faith is stereotypes.
</li><li> The writers are obviously a pretty big fan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, but his use of Jewish symbols is, unsurprisingly, way off the mark. In at least a couple episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> he shows Jews wearing prayer shawls at the wrong times (either outside of prayer, or at nighttime services when they are not worn), and on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em> at one point, in a fantasy cutaway, it shows Cleveland reciting Kol Nidre, the Aramaic annulment of vows that begins Yom Kippur, by reading it from a Torah scroll. It is a legal declaration, not a Biblical passage, and is certainly not found in the Torah (it's not even in the same language).
</li><li> Intentionally used for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> in the episode "Friends of Peter G.": Brian makes a passing comment about how people "were fine for thousands of years without religion," leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> with a few peaceful BC-era characters suddenly begin killing each other at the announcement of Jesus' birth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">One doesn't need to do much research to understand why that one's wrong.</a>
</li><li> In the episode "The Road to the Multiverse" Stewie and Brian traveled to a universe where Christianity never existed. The world is considerably more advanced than in our world. Their justification for this was if Christianity was gone there would be no "Dark Ages". This is wrong on two counts. First, the Dark Ages is just a general term for the time between the fall of the Roman Empires and the Late Middle Ages, not a period of religiously-motivated intellectual stagnation (indeed most historians have stopped calling it "The Dark Ages" for exactly that reason). Second, most of the progress made in science and philosophy during that time period in the Christian world was made by clerics of the Catholic or Orthodox Churches, often because only they had the technical expertise and money to create new books. Saying that the world would have made 1000 years progress in technology is a silly statement to make anyway, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">may well have been the intention.</a>
</li><li> Taken one step further for a joke about how, without Christianity, Michelangelo's inspired paintings of the Sistine Chapel would be replaced by the art of John Hinckley. How did no one realize that the Sistine Chapel is a Christian church? Never mind that Michelangelo based many of his figures on ancient Greek carvings.
</li><li> Every depiction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> in the show is a pudgy man with a strong Italian accent. There have been three popes since the show began, and not a single one of them has been Italian. This one can probably be chalked up to a stereotype since the then-current Pope John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope elected in nearly five centuries.

In the finale, this means (and somehow it's Daphne who just intuitively knows this, and not the one-sixteenth Wiccan herself) that she can cast magic, defeating the evil Witch.
