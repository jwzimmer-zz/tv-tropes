<p>A variation on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> and, sometimes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecies</a>, the Prophetic Fallacy is different in that the prophecy itself — typically a prophetic dream or glimpse through a time window — is incomplete or deceptive in some way rather than simply vague.
</p><p>For example, a man might see himself being knocked down by a car and note that the time on a digital display is 10:51, then spend the entire episode trying to avoid going near a road, despite various events conspiring to put him in danger. He eventually makes it to 10:52 and thinks he is safe, but is knocked down an hour or so later and discovers that he saw the digital clock in a mirror and his actual time of death is 12:01.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Alternatively, characters might have a vision of a terrible future and give up hope, but discover that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDire">the vision was of something fairly innocuous</a> that looked unusually dangerous because of the limits that the vision imposed.
</p><p>The important factor is that whoever sees the vision is not given enough information to work out the truth. Thus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> comes not from the character misunderstanding a vague prophecy, but coming to the only available conclusion given the lack of a full story.
</p><p>This can be used to deliver a moral about not jumping to conclusions. If this trope is used comedically, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity may ensue</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basara">Basara</a></em>, male and female twins are born, and it is prophesized that one of them will overthrow the evil kings that rule post-apocalyptic Japan. The villages automatically assume that the boy is the savior... but he gets killed, leading the girl to disguise herself as him and lead the rebellion. The village wise man comments that she noticed without realizing it that she was in fact the savior.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>, a seer sees Haru (hero) stabbing Elie (heroine) with his sword. Turn out, Elie's magic was going to go crazy and Haru activated the next form of his sword that can cut magic but nothing of substance, thus sealing her nearly-rampaging magic and saving everyone. After this, he waves the sword through his arms a few times to demonstrate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>, the prophecy of the Blue-Clad One refers to a great leader, a bird perched on his shoulder, appearing from a field of gold to lead the nations to peace and unity and save them from the Sea of Corruption. What it actually foretold was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nausicaa, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressingAsTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressingAsTheEnemy">Dorok tunic</a> stained deep blue and indigo from a baby Ohmu's blood, being lifted high into the air by the shining, golden feelers of innumerable Ohmu, her long and bushy-tailed squirrel-fox Teto on her shoulders</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays">Dog Days</a></em> Princess Leo receives a prophecy from a magic mirror that both Princess Millhiore and the Hero Cinque will be killed at a certain date and time. Turns out fortune telling is far from accurate and trying to avoid the prophecy, which never came true, was nearly a disaster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> manages this despite the "prophecy" being something the protagonist <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">saw with his own eyes.</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out "the female lead dies" was a red herring for the real fixed point in time: "the main character sees the female lead lying in a pool of blood, prompting him to send the text message that leads to the discovery of time travel."</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UshioAndTora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UshioAndTora">Ushio and Tora</a></em> led up to the climactic final battle with a time-traveling bakemon visiting the future, when the actual final battle is in full swing. He sees the vaunted Beast Spear shattering into tiny pieces, and his report drives the bakemon coalition to try and forge their own new Beast Spear since the original will fail. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this was the Beast Spear's own intent, splitting itself into shards to attack every Memory Eater that the big bad had sicced on the populace and the heroes' allies.</span>
</li><li> In the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf">Dragon Half</a></em>, Mink is given a prophecy that if she sheds her skin a second time, a hideous monster will appear. Everyone interprets this as her turning into said monster. In the final battle, Mink is forced to turn off the artifact preventing her from molting in order to gain the strength she needs to defeat the Demon Lord Azatodeth, and the monster in question <em>does</em> appear... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a birthmark on Mink's butt</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the Great Toad Sage from Mount Myoboku foresaw Jiraiya travelling the world, writing a book and being the master of someone who will bring a great change in the world, who which either save it or destroy it. Jiraiya would then have to make a difficult choice. And that choice will determine the fate of the world. Listening the prophecy, Jiraiya then travels the world, meets people, write a book and take various pupils: Nagato, Minato and Naruto. All three have the requirements to become the chosen one. Over the course of the story, Minato dies, Nagato takes the path of evil and then dies, leaving only Naruto to takes the role of the Chosen One, since he's the last pupil of Jiraya still alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>: The Stand Thoth is a comic book that shows the future, and just like its user Boingo says, its predictions are <em>never</em> wrong; however, when they come true, they do so in an extremely convoluted way that ends up having the opposite effect of what Boingo and his allies expect. It's appeared twice so far:
<ul><li> The first time it appeared, it predicted that Boingo's brother Oingo would plant a bomb disguised as an orange in the Joestar company's car, and when it went off, it would split Jotaro's face in half. When Oingo went to plant the bomb, the Joestar group returned earlier than expected, forcing Oingo to disguise himself as Jotaro<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vrvl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vrvl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vrvl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the only member of the group not present or hospitalized at the time</span>. Forced to enter the car with them to maintain his cover, Oingo tossed the bomb-orange out the window, but Iggy retrieved it. Oingo then claimed he needed a bathroom break and took the opportunity to flee, but Polnareff noticed that the bomb-orange had been in Iggy's mouth and tossed it out the window, whereupon it landed directly beneath the feet of Oingo, still disguised as Jotaro. One guess what happened to him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Interestingly enough, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean">Stone Ocean</a></em>, Jotaro did met his end via having his face split in half, meaning the prophecy did technically come true</span>.
</li><li> The second time, it predicted that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">Hol Horse</a> fired his gun down an open pipe, the bullets would ricochet out the other end and hit Jotaro in the face at exactly noon. Horse complied with the prediction, but Jotaro moved out of the way just in time, and the bullets ricocheted off a building and passed through <em>the picture of Jotaro in Thoth itself,</em> and Horse's head behind it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonZoroarkMasterOfIllusions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonZoroarkMasterOfIllusions">Pokémon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Grings Kodai getting a vision early on that he would be able to absorb Celebi's Time Ripple and refresh his prophetic abilities at the cost of destroying Crown City's vegetation, and during the climax the event proceeds almost exactly as envisioned despite the heroes' best efforts to stop him. What he didn't see, however, was that the Time Ripple he absorbs is an illusion created by Zoroark, which he couldn't identify due to his illusion-cancelling device being damaged earlier without his knowledge. He then gets his comeuppance shortly afterward.

<ul><li> In "The Amazing Spectacles of Dr. X", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a> winds up with a pair of spectacles that can see the future, and sees a vision of himself drowning in a fishing accident soon afterwards. When the day actually arrives, though, it turns out that the spectacles were showing him a public service announcement he had agreed to take part in about how an iron lung can save a person's life in a case like this.
</li><li> In the graphic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TopTen">Top 10</a> — The Forty-Niners</em>, two characters see part of a newspaper headline from the future that suggests Nazis have taken over America. However, the headline is later shown in full and revealed to be celebrating the Nazis' <em>failure</em>.
</li><li> This was the basis of Dream Girl's use in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> takes this to rather insane extremes as Neo and his friends deal with apparently contradicting prophecies from the Oracle that work themselves out in the end.
<ul><li> The trick, though, is that the Oracle isn't really telling Neo or the other Zionites what her prophecies actually <em>are</em>. She tells them, "exactly what they need to hear" in order for her prophecies to come true.
</li><li> There's also a trick to the wording. She said Neo wasn't The One — didn't say he couldn't <em>become</em> The One. In fact, she said the opposite; she compared being The One to being in love and said it seemed like Neo was "waiting for something", which suggest that Oneness isn't something you just get automatically.
<ul><li> It's even more detailed than that - Oracle: "You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something." Neo: "What?" Oracle: "Your next life, maybe. Who knows?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neo only really unlocks his One-ness after being shot and apparently killed by the Agents, then coming back to life</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> It is Neo's love for Trinity that allows him to save the day.
<ul><li> The Oracle and the Architect could only use their prophecy to guide the One within the Matrix itself. For the Architect, it was to compel the One to fulfill his function. For the Oracle, it was to add an unbalancing element to the One's choice in hopes of ending the war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That spoiler was Trinity's love (which was real and existed in and out of the Matrix), which compelled Neo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, saving Trinity from death within the Matrix, despite the Architect's fated words, or Neo's own dreams of her death.</span>
</li><li> In fact, what seemed to be a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> false prophecy that the war would end when the One reached the Source</span> became true. The Architect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wasn't the Source, but the Machine City that Neo sought to reach in The Matrix: Revolutions.</span>
</li><li> The Architect's words still rung true; in the course of Neo's ultimate choice, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Trinity still dies and he was powerless to stop it</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSucksToBeTheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSucksToBeTheChosenOne">It Sucks to Be the Chosen One</a>.

</li><li> The main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> is driven by Papa Smurf misreading an attempt to foretell the outcome of the Blue Moon Festival thanks to having the critical part of the vision interrupted by Clumsy Smurf — who, of course, ends up being integral in said scene. The rest of the film consists mainly of Papa making the prophecy come true with his attempts to keep Clumsy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitHere">out of the way</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow">Willow</a></em> sees the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">evil Queen</a> Bavmorda come across the prophecy of a child bearing a mark, who will lead to her destruction. Naturally, she scours the land capturing all pregnant women in search for this child. When Elora Dannan is born, all those people who have heard of the prophecy rally to protect the newborn so she can fulfill her destiny... accidentally bringing together a force that can storm Bavmorda's castle, while the queen herself is destroyed by the very spell she intended to kill baby Elora with. In the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">divisive</a>) sequel novel series <em>Chronicles of the Shadow War</em> this leads to all sorts of problems when she grows up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> who's already done what she was Chosen to do (it involves alternate timelines and inter-dimensional travel).

Knowing that he would be put to death for admitting it, he says only that "a decisive victory would be won" — neglecting to mention who would be the victor. Even then, he almost doesn't get away with it; Lord Hong demands to know if he's sure, and he only manages to escape by pretending to get indignant: "What, so you're the seer now?

</li><li> The Palantír does this a lot. Among other things, it also tricks Sauron into attacking Aragorn.
</li><li> It's heavily implied that the Palantír also shows Denethor that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frodo is imprisoned in the tower of Cirith Ungol</span>, leading him to believe that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Enemy has the Ring</span>.

One note about the Vong is that twins are exceedingly rare-and their religious beliefs indicate that one will always kill the other. They are intrigued not only by Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo, but by Leia's children, Jacen and Jaina. To that end, they attempt to <em>make</em> it happen, by capturing one and them inducing them to kill the other. This in fact leads to their downfall, as with a little help from a spy Jacen not only is able to fake loyalty to the Yuuzhan Vong, but learns a number of Force uses that become instrumental in the war, but also that he corrupts a critical piece of Vong biotech.

His master lends him a horse to flee to the town of Samarra. When the master finds Death, and asks why she made the gesture, she replies that it was only a start of surprise at seeing him in Baghdad, since their appointment was that night in Samarra.

Rincewind declines.

She is killed by a freak avalanche at the <em>exact same instant</em> that her house collapses into a pile of ashes.

When Zanna and her best friend Deeba accidentally travel to UnLondon, Zanna attempts to fight the Smog...and is almost immediately put out of commission. Deeba, however, proves to be much more effective at combating the Smog, and she rapidly becomes the hero of the story. This is only the first of MANY plot twists in this novel. Also, the book of prophecy that predicted incorrectly? It spends quite a lot of the rest of the book being depressed and thinking that it is useless. All this results in the one thing the Book was certain was a misprint being absolutely correct and the key to stopping the Smog.

</li><li> <em>Flashforward</em> by Robert J.

Believing this means the future is predestined, people make assumptions based on what they saw themselves doing in the future. Some start doing whatever their future selves did while others are devastated by their visions. This drives one character who wanted to be a writer but saw himself as a bus boy to kill himself, ironically proving that the future wasn't predestined anyway. It's also implied he was working as a bus boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsForABook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsForABook">for book research</a>.
</li><li> A subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>. One of the main characters owns a book of prophecies made by a distant ancestor that's been passed down from generation to generation. Every last prophecy is perfectly accurate-but pronouncedly unclear. The subversion is that this character, and generations previous, were fully aware of this, and it became a sort of family business to try and decipher them. This wasn't an easy job, since the best explanation that she can give another character was that Agnes Nutter, the original seer, was looking at things she didn't understand through a very small metaphorical tube, in no discernible order, and so while things often slot into place afterward (some in time to do some good even, like, "Dont buye Betamacks"), until then what anyone <em>thinks</em> the original seer was predicting is as good a guess as anyone else's.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the prophecies are indeed so accurate that the characters eventually realize they can just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pull one out at random and it'll be the one they need</span>.
</li><li> The ones relating directly to her family tend to be extremely straightforward, like "at this date and time avoid a falling brick". There's also a clear prophesy that the pair above will fall in love and have sex while working on the problem (with lots of "encouraging" commentary from generations in between in the notes); the non-descendent is rather disturbed to learn this.

</li><li> In Daphne du Maurier's short story <em>Don't Look Now</em> (later made into a film), John Baxter stays in Venice because he sees his wife on a boat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out he can see the future, and she was actually returning to Venice for his funeral</span>.

Macbeth is eventually killed in battle by Macduff, a man born by caesarean section. The trope is downplayed in that the prophet is himself a hint of the prophecy twist: a bloody child.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">Star Trek: New Frontier</a></em> novel, a scientist is given a vision that he'll die on his 43rd birthday. When the day comes and goes, he is relieved...until he finds out that his assistant had been surreptitiously altering things on his project, inadvertantly speeding up the clocks in the process. A raiding party promptly beams onto their station and kills him...on his 43rd birthday.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept">Apprentice Adept</a></em> series, the Red Adept receives an Oracle prophecy stating that she would be "destroyed" by Adept Blue. Red sets about striking first; murdering Blue and making an attempt at Blue's "other self", Stile, in Proton (scientific twin world to Phaze's magical one). When Red and Stile finally meet, and Red confesses why she's been trying to kill him, Stile points out that, had she not killed Blue, Stile never could've entered Phaze. And probably wouldn't have anyway, if Red's first attempt to kill him hadn't left him unable to race horses. Turns out The Oracle (Who was really <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a self-aware super-computer with connections in both Phaze and Photon</span>) intentionally phrased Red's prophecy in such a way that her paranoia would do the rest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">counting on her not to stop and think about it</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth-Gotten Gains</a></em>, a prophecy states that the Golden Hoard will be reunited by a green hand. Normally this would be a helpful clue, except that both Aahz and Barrik have green scales, and Tananda's skin has a touch of green to it: <em>everyone</em> who's a candidate to find the Hoard fits the description, making the prophecy worthless due to its imprecision.

Whilst on the brink of death, Horus is shown a vision of the future where his father, The Emperor of Mankind, is worshipped as a god across the entire galaxy. He "visits" a world devoted solely to the Emperor's worship and sees statues devoted to the Emperor and the Primarchs, only to note to his compounding fury that only <em>some</em> of the Primarchs are so honored — Horus himself and the Primarchs he is closest to are all missing. Horus draws the conclusion that the Emperor wants to install himself as a god, and will furthermore suppress all knowledge of Horus, his faithful Warmaster, out of a desire to claim all the glory, as though he'd conquered the galaxy without help. Thoroughly incensed, Horus launches a galaxy-wide rebellion that will eventually lead to the Emperor being unwillingly deified as he languishes on life support, and Horus and the "missing" Primarchs very well known indeed, as the arch-traitors of all mankind.

<ul><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>, Reverend Jim gives a number of prophecies that seem to come true. When Jim declares that Alex Rieger will die the following Thursday at 7pm, Rieger is skeptical. One the night of the prophecy, Louie goes to visit Rieger to keep him company and to help avert whatever tragedy is to fall him. As the highly improbable prophesied chain of events leading up to Rieger's death start to come true, Louie grows more concerned and Alex grows more incredulous. He finally decides to tempt fate by acting out the more ridiculous of Jim's prophecies, just to prove to Louie that it's all a bunch of hogwash. Finally, at 7pm, there's a knock on the door. Louie hesitantly opens the door, and sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a girl scout selling cookies. Louie screams, the girl scout screams and flees, and Louie slams the door in terror: "Did you see it, Rieger? It was <em>hideous!!</em>"</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium">Medium</a></em> uses this a lot. The main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and her three daughters</span> has lots of visions that often take days to figure out what those visions really are saying.
</li><li> Happened numerous times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963">The Outer Limits</a></em> and other supernatural anthology shows, typically involving someone trying to avoid their death at a given time/date, but learning that he was supposed to die a little while later.
</li><li> The series that was truly the king of this trope was the contemporaneous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneStepBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneStepBeyond">One Step Beyond</a></em>, which seemingly used this twist every other episode.
</li><li> Also happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a></em>, though rather more rarely.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episode "Cassandra", the eponymous computer predicts that Rimmer will die of a heart attack. However, he notes that Cassandra does not know that he's Rimmer, and tricks a crewman into wearing his jacket (with nametag). Sure enough, the crewmember dies. (Also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>: he dies of a heart attack brought on by the stress of being told he's going to die of a heart attack). However, we later learn that several of the predictions she made were intentional lies in an attempt to get revenge on Lister for killing her. It fails and Lister does kill her, but it's more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice">Rube Goldberg Device</a>-esque accident than any intentional murder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em> is entirely built around this, as Raven's brief glimpses of the future never give her the whole story. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as she tries to fix what may or may not actually be broken - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecies">and breaks it</a>. And learns her lesson... for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">precisely twenty-three hours and five minutes</a>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a>,</em> a widower king's evil advisor tries to get him to kill a child prophesied to take his throne. Eventually, the plot's exposed, the king marries the infant's mother, and the baby will, in the fullness of time, take the king's throne. But he will take the king's throne as his heir, not his usurper. The series is (loosely) based on Greco-Roman myth, where this sort of thing was common, though usually more tragic.
<ul><li> Also quite nicely subverted in season four. The entire season features Xena being haunted by a vision of herself and Gabrielle being crucified, and slowly the pieces seem to start coming together for it to happen: she recognizes a nearby mountain peak as in the background of the vision, and is forced to cut Gabrielle's hair to the length she saw. So much time is spent on this over an entire year's worth of episodes that the audience pretty much all assumed that there was going to be some twist to get them out of it. Nope; things happen exactly as Xena saw, and she and Gabrielle die on their crosses. Of course, this being the show it is that's no obstacle for them continuing to star on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> did an episode with a number of these, that always cut off right before revealing that the scene shown is actually to their benefit.

</li><li> Londo Mollari had a vision of his own death: when he is an old man, he and a Narn will strangle each other to death.When he meets G'Kar, Londo recognizes him as the Narn from the vision and treats him as a personal enemy (it didn't help that their people had been enemies for decades). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> While this occurs exactly as Londo saw, he misread the <em>context</em>: he and G'Kar are no longer enemies, and G'Kar killing him is an act of mercy because Londo's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Keeper</a>," will not let him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate">kill himself</a>.

<ul><li> In the first season finale, Wes translates a prophecy to say that Angel will die. In the end it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wes mistranslated it, and the real prophecy said that he would "live and die" (the language of the prophecy uses the same word for both); in other words, become human</span>. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the prophecy only said "the vampire with a soul," so in the fifth season, a conflict is introduced that it could have been Spike they were talking about. At the time the prophecy was translated, Angel was not only the only vampire with a soul, but the only one that had <em>ever</em> existed, nobody had even considered the idea that it could refer to someone else</span>.
</li><li> Also the prophecy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "the father will kill the son"</span>, which drove multiple episodes in the back half of the third season, was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">faked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">demon Sahjhan (who, upon revealing this, taunts "read any good prophecies lately?") because the true prophecy was "the one fathered by the vampire with a soul will grow to manhood and kill Sahjhan"</a></span>. When Wesley goes to one of the Loa for clarification, he is told that the vampire will certainly devour his child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Angel's blood supply from the butcher had been spiked with Connor's blood by Wolfram &amp; Hart and at the season 4 finale, Angel 'kills' Connor: he destroys Connor's true identity, giving him a fake one to save his sanity by giving him a normal family life, one that carries no memory of his real life. Also, Sahjan hearing only "the son would kill Sahjan" led him to causing Conner to be in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">the exact position to do just that</a>.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">Tenth Doctor</a> is told that before he regenerates, "he will knock four times."

Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it wasn't the Master, nor was it the power-mad President of the Time Lords...it was Wilf, after all the trouble had been sorted, knocking quietly on the door of the broken containment chamber that's about to be flooded with radiation.

The only way for the Doctor to get Wilf out is for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">the Doctor to lock himself in the adjacent chamber</a>, thus triggering his regeneration</span>.
</li><li> This was a staple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> throughout the 1st season thanks to future-painter Isaac Mendez. Everything he painted came true, except that none of them came true in quite the same way everyone interpreted them. Some examples:
<ul><li> Two in <em>Homecoming</em>, the first was the painting of Sylar standing over a dead cheerleader, which everyone expects to be Claire Bennett, who he's currently chasing. It turns out to be fellow cheerleader Jackie, who Sylar mistakes for Claire. The other was a picture of a dead Peter lying outside Claire's high school. That does come true, except that he comes back to life thanks to acquiring Claire's regenerative abilities.
</li><li> A picture of Hiro pointing a sword at a dinosaur, which made everyone believe Hiro's time traveling abilities would send him back to the Jurassic Age. Instead it came true when he pointed a fake sword at a museum dinosaur.
</li><li> A picture of Nathan standing in the Oval Office, insinuating that he gets elected president, a painting that becomes the basis for mob boss Daniel Linderman's plan for world domination. As it turns out, the painting comes true, but it's not really Nathan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's Sylar, who gains illusion abilities, kills Nathan, and takes his place in his own plot to gain power</span>. Thank god it only happened in an alternate future seen only in <em>Five Years Gone</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>-powered example occurred in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> after the super-computer ORAC joined the cast, when they tested out its future-prediction capabilities and got a short video clip of what appeared to be the <em>Liberator</em> exploding. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out it was another ship of the same design, launched in pursuit after they spent the episode trying to escape the people who built the <em>Liberator</em> and disputed their salvage claim, and it turned out to have been ORAC who sabotaged it.</span> Apparently they decided that getting ORAC to predict the future was more trouble than it was worth after that, as it was never used again. It's also vaguely implied that ORAC was intentionally screwing with them, either to make a point or for its own amusement.
</li><li> This happens a fair bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeadZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeadZone">The Dead Zone</a></em>, with Johnny getting visions where the intended target/victim is unclear or he jumps to the wrong conclusion about what he is seeing because he doesn't know what he's seeing is incomplete. A particularly good example occurs when he has a vision of himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing a stranger</span> and the clues lead him to believe Sarah or JJ are in danger (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the victim is really Bruce and it's a complete accident.</span>) At the end of the episode, Johnny laments that he just sees flashes of events out of context which makes trying to predict (and prevent) the future very difficult.
<ul><li> In another episode Johny gets a vision of a school shooting but does not see the shooter's face. The school principal believes him and institutes a zero-tolerance policy in order to prevent the event from occurring. At the end of the episode Johny realizes that the vision was from a few years in the future and the shooter is still a young boy who has yet to experience the abuse that will turn him into a killer. Johny exposes the pedophile teacher that would abuse the boy and prevents the tragedy. However, the school's heavy handed tactics cause another student to rebel because of the harassment he received and then a paranoid security guard shoots the student thinking that the he is the shooter from Johny's vision.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em>, Curtis (in a relationship with Alisha) receives a vision of the future where he is standing on a roof in a superhero costume where he is propositioned by an unknown girl. Once back to the present he assumes that this happens in the far future, where he is destined to become a superhero and have a new love interest. In fact his relationship with Alicia quickly falls apart, he meets the girl from the vision, and after only a week or two he attends a fancy dress party wearing the costume, allowing the vision to come true.

<ul><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>, Elphaba predicts her future greatness, saying "When people see me, they will scream" and "There'll be a celebration throughout Oz, all to do with me." However, as it turns out, people scream out of fear, and the celebration is about her death.
</li><li> Being killed by a creature who was already dead seemed rather unlikely to Herakles until the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTrachiniae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTrachiniae">The Trachiniae</a></em>, where it is revealed that his wife (who has since also killed herself) accidentally poisoned him with a purported love potion given to her by a centaur he killed on his deathbed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">Oedipus Rex</a></em>, Oedipus was prophesied to "Kill his father and marry his mother." Consequently, Oedipus left his family and his city to wander the world. In the process, he did kill his father and marry his mother in unrelated events. The prophecy omitted critical information about the events of the prophecy. (Any vision of the events would have seen beyond the bare statement of the prophecy, which naturally implies immediate connection between the two events.)

When he actually reaches Blood Island, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaintingSeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaintingSeer">draws 5 Death cards from a single Tarot deck</a>.

Jolee and this Jedi were later captured by a warlord, but the other Jedi raving about his destiny annoyed the warlord so much that he threw him into the ship's engines. Jolee notes that the Jedi's must've damaged something during his fall, as the ship blew up, the warlord was killed, and the political system of the entire sector was radically changed.
<ul><li> Similarly, Jolee's accounts of the player's "swirling force" are vague and cryptic enough to prevent them from affecting the player's choices at all. Jolee simply wants to observe.
</li><li> And in the sequel, pretty much everything Kreia says, prophetic or not, is a semi-lie that manipulates everyone and everything to following her grand plan. For instance, she says the Jedi cut the player off from the Force. When in fact it was the Jedi's flawed teachings that led to the Mandalorian Wars, during which the Exile cut him/herself off from the Force due to... well, it's a long story. The Exile goes looking for the Jedi to get some answers... and, well, they don't survive long.
<ul><li> Her grand plan doesn't matter much beyond itself, it is meant to build up the PC as a Jedi and ally in Revan's quest against the real Sith Empire and nothing else. Completely wiping out the remains of the Jedi and the local bunch of Sith was an incidental bonus (she seemed quite annoyed that she had to wipe out the Jedi in fact).
</li><li> That and she also wanted, y'know, to kill the Force.
</li><li> Well, maybe. Or she wanted the Exile to kill her, completing his/her training in typical Sith fashion. Or she had some bad cheese. With Kreia, it's impossible to know for sure about anything she ever said or did. She basically never tells the full truth, and it's difficult to impossible to figure out which parts are the truth and which are the lies.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, it's revealed that Darth Zash chose the Sith Inquisitor as her apprentice due to having foreseen them in a vision where they quiet the newly reawakened spirit of Lord Kallig, who's influence had killed or driven mad nearly every soul to enter the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas. She didn't realise however that this was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only does the Inquisitor have the rare ability to draw forth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Force Ghosts</a>, but is a direct descendant of Kallig himself, who had long since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">awaiting</a> their arrival at that time</span>.
<ul><li> Furthermore, she has two visions where she sees the Inquisitor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> standing over her body and leading the Empire into a new future</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em>, depending on how you interpret the prophecy that Raziel will kill Kain, either it foretells both Raziel killing Kain (which happens) AND Kain killing Raziel (which happens), or Raziel destroying himself (which happens). The series has always been a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> with temporal mechanics.
<ul><li> All of this is actually an in-universe misinterpretation of the prophecy; the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursor">precursor</a> races each foretold of a champion. The prophecy showed two possible outcomes, one with each champion winning. Everyone assumes that Kain is the vampire champion and that Raziel is the other one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In truth, Raziel is both champions, and the multiple choice prophecy is due to his own free will, something that only he has in the setting.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Overlapping with the self-fulfilling variation, the wizard whose prophesies form the narrative of the Myth 2 mod <em>The Seventh God</em> can see everything about the war but the identity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, a foreigner who had united the scattered goblin tribes. He tries to prevent the game's events by traveling to their lands and trying to unite them and "lead them to greater glory." This trope is actually a rule of prophesies in the setting, as seers can't see their own future. He actually knows this rule, but is thrown off because he actually can see himself in the prophesies; it turns out it's his apprentice, who had adopted his name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>, the Fire King Onyx believes himself to be invincible since the prophecy of the Worlds End clearly states that he can only be defeated by the World Tree. Because there is no World Tree in Erion, he basically assumes that he can stomp his way through the fairy kingdom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This gives Mercedes the reason to attack and kill him.

The character who brings the warning knows it because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's from the future and witnessed the destruction first hand.</span> What neither he nor anyone else ever realizes is that this information is missing one important detail: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Beast's motivation.</span> It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Beast isn't committing genocide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, he's sacrificing the non-Conduit population to bring as many Conduits into their powers as possible, and he's doing this because only Conduits can survive a plague unleashed by the event that began giving them their powers.</span> If the player chooses the good ending in the sequel, Cole decides that this new information changes nothing and he still has an obligation to stop the Beast, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the only alternative is to reverse the direction of the genocide, killing himself and all Conduits as part of the process needed to cure the plague.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure">Little Big Adventure II/Twinsen's Odyssey</a></em> has an old prophecy hijacked by a character who removed the final part of it, since it predicted the downfall of a deity he was impersonating. Naturally, his actions eventually made the full version of the prophecy self-fulfilling (and it <em>did</em> turn out to be true in the end).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project III: Legacy of Time.</a></em> The El Dorado fragment of the titular Legacy gives the city's shaman precognitive abilities, which are usually scarily accurate to the point that some of the city's Nazca-esque line art (in the first millennium AD) depicts the exact logo of your 24th-century top secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice">Time Police</a> organization. However, one particular prophecy he receives apparently shows a nearby farm boy using the legacy fragment to stop the Two Brothers (actually the alien species Cyrollan and Qo'Thalas) from destroying the city; actually he's seeing the player character, disguised as the boy, retrieving the fragment and bringing it back to the future to stop them from destroying the Earth. El Dorado, on the other hand, is utterly destroyed in the crossfire the very night after the player leaves.
</li><li> As befitting a game that the developers call a "playable Greek Tragedy," this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedOdyssey">Assassin's Creed: Odyssey</a></em>, during the "Family Values" quest. Supideo has locked himself in a cage much to his parents consternation, after an oracle told him his mother's blood would be spilled on the ground and his father would scream to the heavens. He contracts the protagonist with finding his sword and his shield with which his parents will protect themselves from his supposed wrath, but by the end of it, his parents reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was adopted, the protagonist murdered his birth mother to get his shield, and they may or may not have also had sex with his birth father, which was why he was screaming to the heaven—just in <em>agony.</em> Supideo proceeds to free himself from the cage, running screaming from the revelations, and goes blind, upon which he curses the protagonist.</span>

<ul><li> There's also the entirety of the Fortune Teller episode, which SEEMS to be leading this way. Everything she prophesises is either incredibly vague or self-fulfilling ("I'll meet my wife on the day I wear red shoes, so every day I wear red shoes!"). Then she makes a series of predictions that fly in the face of logic concerning the local about-to-erupt volcano, and everyone adopts a very laissez faire approach. It gets so bad that the Gaang has to fly up and literally rearrange the clouds to get her to change her prophecy, which FINALLY gets everyone off their asses, proving that her initial prediction was the wrong one. The subversion, pointed out explicitly by her, is that it ended up that everything turned out literally as she predicted (the village itself was <em>not</em> destroyed by the volcano).

<ul><li> Elderly lasat mystic Chava discusses this trope. She's lived long enough to give multiple prophecies and knows there are multiple ways of interpreting even what seems very straightforward. In relation to her most recent prophecy about The Child, The Warrior, and the Fool, she admits to Zeb (the Child) that people change throughout their lives and thus his disbelief that Kallus is the Warrior (based in what he knows of Kallus) isn't enough to discount the entire prophecy. So far the parts involving Zeb and Kallus have been right, but part of Kallus fulfilling his part and forging his own destiny <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> via becoming the next Fulcrum</span> only happened because Zeb, having fulfilled his role already, was willing to give him a chance and save his life.
