<p>A work of fiction sets up a moral dilemma or other painful choice, then finds a way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">resolve it without actually addressing the issue it raised</a>. Say, Alice is seriously ill and Bob is considering robbing a local pharmacy to get the medicine she desperately needs. Then he wins the money he needs in the lottery, meaning that he (and the writers) never have to come down on the question of whether theft is acceptable for a good cause.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is used for a number of reasons. It allows the show to resolve the tension without
</p><ol><li>giving an unrealistically clear-cut or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> solution to an ambiguous problem, or
</li><li>alienating the half of the audience who would disapprove of the resolution if the characters did make the hard choice.
</li></ol>It avoids having to anything objectionable (who wants to be on record saying that theft might be okay if you're in dire straits?) And it lets creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">flex their godlike muscles</a>: it's their story, and they don't have to write the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> that would almost certainly result for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Alice and Bob.
<p>Expect this in works invoking ethnicity and/or gender tropes in ways that might otherwise be blatantly liable to charges of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, e.g. relating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">Mars-and-Venus Gender Contrast</a>. Usually, a Debate and Switch is pulled in one of the following ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The antagonist is originally set up as doing something that falls in the moral (and legal) gray area, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">jumps off the slippery slope</a> or is revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">Straw Hypocrite</a>.
</li><li> Related to the above, if one party turns out to be partnered with or working for any kind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainByDefault">Villain by Default</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The evidence points to the antagonist having committed a crime over the issue under discussion, then new evidence is uncovered that shows that the motive was actually more clear-cut.
</li><li> The protagonists are put into the morally gray situation, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>.
</li><li> The protagonists are put into the morally gray situation, then another consideration makes it much more black-and-white. The decision is made on that consideration, with the original considerations becoming moot. No Third Option necessary, just a Second Question.
</li><li> Before a decision can be made, outside events render it moot, such as a suspect dying in an accident while the antagonists are debating their guilt.
</li><li> Someone on either side is revealed to be lying about something (motive, true conditions, consequences, etc.), and lying automatically makes them the loser.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The argument over culpability turns out to be moot, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">suspect</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">proven to actually be innocent</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, one of the driving points of the narrative is whether or not the eponymous character would use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Shikon no Tama</a> to turn into a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> (or maybe even a full human.) The point is moot since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kagome destroys the Jewel at the end of the manga. Any wish would be 'wrong'</span>. Then again, quite a bit of emphasis is put on the fact that Kagome loves him just as who he is, making it ultimately a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a>" aesop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> made a major plot point being the villain's plan to lock everyone in the world into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">their own personal dream world that would give them their every desire</a>. Whether or not this would ultimately be a good thing for a world that raises child soldiers is glossed over in favor of discussing how villainous the means of the people trying to set it off are using. Later on it's also added that the plan also slowly turns people into empty zombies, making the initial debate further removed by having the dream world be fatal. Likewise, once people are released their reactions are glossed over and no one expresses any interest at all over their dream worlds despite how easily traumatic it would be for many of them to see lost loved ones again thinking they were real. And then even <em>that</em> is rendered moot when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out the whole thing is being manipulated to resurrect a villain whose goals are much less defensible.</span>
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDaughterOfTwentyFaces">The Daughter of Twenty Faces</a></em> deals with how the protagonists are supposed to be sympathetic when they're major thieves. The main character befriends a lonely little girl, who happens to be the daughter of the head of security for a museum holding the object the protagonists want to steal. In doing so, she learns how to sneak past the security guards and that *<em>Gasp</em>* stealing a priceless object from the museum could cause big trouble for the kindly security chief and his innocent daughter. Chiko's huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">betrayal of her new friend</a> is softened by the revelation that the little girl was actually evil at the end of the episode, and everything she said about her father was probably a lie.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic">of course.</a> Is it right to stop <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chao Lingshen</span>, who is obviously not a bad person and seems to have a good motive? Negi spends so much time worrying about it that his students basically just tell him to shut up after a while, because if it was so important she ought to just <em>tell</em> him. Eventually, they decide it doesn't matter what they're doing is right or wrong, they just don't want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">to be turned into ermines</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chao</span> hasn't convinced them otherwise. Some fans think it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">intentional</a> in order to set Negi up for Fate, who also seems to have a good goal and bad methods. He notably worries much less about it, anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Which may have been why Chao set up the moral dilemma in the first place</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> does this, although it must be noted that the moral ambiguities it toys with have been debated for centuries and probably will continue to be debated for centuries after: Is all life equal? Do some people deserve to die? Is it right to kill a killer? Is evil irredeemable?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FushigiBoshiNoFutagoHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FushigiBoshiNoFutagoHime">Fushigi Boshi No Futago Hime</a></em>: Fine and Rein find out that Mirlo is in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with a rather undesirable dimwit, and are out to break it up. Reviewer Al1701 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQ4wqYiE9Y">pointed out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that this action seems short-sighted, since the deal for the marriage is in exchange for dimwit's father repairing the Waterdrop Kingdom's cloudmaker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That is, until the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> turns out to be a big ruse by the Moon Kingdom chancellor. Doesn't stop this from being one of the best eps of the whole series.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, several older and less successful mangakas start submitting works for Jump, prompting a debate between Takagi and Mashiro over whether they should be given a chance for a comeback; Takagi doesn't think so, while Mashiro, whose uncle kept trying to get a series even after his contract was canceled, strongly disagrees, and Nizuma believes that writers should not be treated as disposable. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nanamine is using these mangakas as his way to try a second time with an improved version of his "system"</span>. In the end, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azuma, one of the manga artists Nanamine had used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">and then discarded</a> succeeds on his own</span>, perhaps making this a subversion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> poses the question: does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">utopia justify the means</a> if you plan on ending all crime by killing all criminals? Said question is rendered moot by the fact that the perpetrator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Light Yagami, goes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">into a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god complex</a> who kills all who oppose him. This is also present in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">the way</a> someone responds to Light trying to justify his actions.
<ul><li> A lot of the morality debate is cut from the anime, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final debate between Light and Near</span> is cut down to its bare minimum, including Light expressing his belief that he's not only getting rid of the criminals, but creating a society where people are free to do good. Near similarly believes that Kira is forcing his own views onto others under threat of death, "neither peaceful nor just," and asks everyone else what they think about it, to which they respond with tacit approval.
</li><li> There is considerably more examination of the ramifications of Kira's new world order in the manga. However, while the authors ultimately leave it up to the reader to decide whether <em>Kira</em> is morally justified or not, they note that <em>Light</em> was corrupted by having the power to kill at will and was no longer actually working toward his professed ideals.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Death Note: How To Read</a></em>, the authors explain that this trope is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel">Necessary Weasel</a> because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">target demographic</a>. Since they were writing for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em>, the focus was on the plot-and-counterplot between Light and L, and not the question of whether Light's actions were right or not. They also state that if they were writing for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen">seinen</a> magazine, the moral and social ramifications would instead have taken center stage and been thoroughly explored.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> asks if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Incubators' desire to prevent the early heat death of the universe, and the total extinguishing of all life that it would cause through the Puella Magi system</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">justifies</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">the suffering of the Puella Magi, who inevitably turn into witches thanks to that very same system</a></span>. All this is thrown out the window when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madoka ascends to godhood and rewrites the Puella Magi system so that the girls don't have to fight witches or turn into them</span>.

</li><li> One of the main messages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway">Smile Down The Runway</a></em> is how you must never compromise on your dreams/passions. At one point, Ikuto runs into financial troubles due to his mother's illness and is given the choice to back down as a fashion designer in an upcoming fashion event and work as a patterner for a more experienced designer instead (thus compromising his dream), or convince a friend (who was being scouted as a model) to quit being a fashion designer (thus compromising <em>her</em> dream). Then another friend's father (the owner of a modeling agency) offers to buy his designs, which quickly resolves his financial issues without him needing to sacrifice his or his friend's dream.

He knows he could do it and get away with it, but should he kill him? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't, or at least he tries not to; the guy dies anyway. But Eli can't help but wonder if he held back during the surgery even just a little, and if that makes him any better than the "indirect" murderers he hunts down as Cardiac.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, a group of super-powered teenagers filming a reality show attack a group of villains, causing one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">to explode like an atomic bomb, destroying all of Stamford</a>. Public hysteria ensues, and super heroes are placed in a difficult dilemma: with uncontrolled super-hero actions banned, heroes must sign the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a> and work for the government, or be hunted down by all the government forces (including the superheroes that signed for it). The registration side won, and things stayed that way for a time. Well, and once the thing has lasted long enough, how do we return things to the way they always were? Easy: put a supervillain on top of the registration side, put all superheroes on the other side, and turn a topic of (allegedly) grey and gray morality <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0otid');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0otid" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0otid');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">during the event itself the Pro-Registration side crossed too many lines throughout the different tie-in books to remain in the gray side of morality</span> into a topic of black and white morality.
</li><li> Similarly, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Mutant Registration Acts</a> are never given an actual debate. It's sometimes acknowledged that, hey, these are people with the power to level mountains just by opening their eyes and reasonable people might want some means of protection from the bad ones, but the Act is nearly always being pushed by bigots who are using it as the first step in wiping out mutantkind. Even when the promoter is <em>not</em> such a bigot, the specter of such information still being used <em>by</em> bigots to facilitate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> remains omnipresent. The very first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> plotline, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a></em>, revolves around the dark world created by enforcing mutant registration, where mutants are forcibly marked and herded into concentration camps, or even exterminated altogether. Animated depictions usually take away the moral ambiguity by portraying such a world as mostly being the fault of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">defective programming</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot">Sentinels</a> humans use to enforce the registration laws.
<ul><li> The same usually happen whenever someone come up with a mutant cure. The anti-cure side will usualy argue that mutation is part of who you are and there is nothing to cure and will be presented as being right in this opinion, forgetting that the comic has frequently depicted people who would like to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">get rid of their powers</a>, often with very good reason, because their uncontrollable powers cause them constant suffering and/or endanger anybody near them. Then the point is rendered moot because the one behind the cure (or someone else who get a hold of it) had malevolent intentions, was planning to <em>cure</em> all mutants regardless of wether or not they want it, or there is some nasty side-effect.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2">Incredibles 2</a></em> also has an interesting dilemma. The story's main antagonist raises some valid points about the reliance on superheroes making people weak. The fact that this villain brainwashes the superheroes into declaring war on national tv is never discussed. After foiling the antagonist, the public just accept superheroes again as if it never happened.

Now that's still ethically highly questionable, but... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">oh, never mind, the process is fatal, and he won't believe this. And just to make sure Magneto has a firm grip on the villain ball, his "process" is powered by an unwilling Rogue, because he's not willing to sacrifice his own life for the cause when he can sacrifice somebody else's instead</span>.
</li><li> The sequels avoid the issue altogether by making him progressively more villainous. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, he does try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a> (apparently unwilling to pass up the opportunity after the other villain nearly managed to Kill All Mutants), and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em> he even sees his fellow mutants as expendable pawns.
</li><li> In the third movie, this is also done with the debate about using the mutant "cure" versus protesting it. Plenty of mutants are shown benefiting from the cure, while just as many find the idea insulting. There are allies of the X-men who speak in favor of it and there are mutants opposed to it who form nice, organized meetings to figure out how to get their views heard. And then Magneto shows up and the rest of the movie has him and his violent followers as the main mutants protesting the cure. Also, he destroys the facility producing the cure and the mutant behind it is taken away. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And the very end of the movie heavily implies the cure isn't permanent, so the point is moot.</span>

And because of this the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for the most part goes unharmed.

It is likely that Kirk knew how Nero would respond, but wanted to offer him the freedom to choose his own destruction.

In regards to the latter, Dennis bemoans the practice of hiring lower-skilled people on the basis of immutable characteristics like skin color, especially in regards to high-risk professions such as his job as a fireman. However, he follows this up with a bunch of racist remarks directed at Derek's black teacher, showing that Dennis is arguing in bad faith without addressing the merit of the argument itself.

A dramatic example is when Tim is dating Mary and suddenly gets a chance to spend the night with an old crush. If he were to succumb to temptation, he could go back in time and undo it, but still remember the entire experience. Would that be ethical? Would it still constitute infidelity? And what does that say about all his other uses of time travel? When faced with that issue, he realizes he doesn't <em>want</em> to sleep with anyone except Mary, and runs home to propose to her. It's a sweet resolution, but one that means that the core questions are never actually addressed.

Le Guin</a> can be read as a dramatized debate over the question of whether anarchism, represented by the "Odonian" philosophy practised on the planet Anarres, or liberal democratic capitalism, represented by the nation of A-Io on Anarres' sister-planet Urras, is better. Though the author clearly prefers anarchism, for most of the book the question is dealt with subtly, with the failings of Anarresti society and the successes of the society of A-Io both being shown. Then, practically out of the blue, A-Io massacres peaceful protesters by the thousand. Well, <em>duh</em>, Anarresti anarchism is better than <em>that</em>. The whole philosophical debate is tossed aside and replaced by Baddies Are Bad. In an interesting case, the A-Io's actions are understandable, though not justified - they remember what the last strike led to, and they are all out of moons to bribe dissidents with. It's also probably worth noting that, while massacres of striking workers weren't common in 1970s America, they were common in America at the turn of the century, so this could also simply be a case of Anachronism Stew, but it seems probable that A-Io is meant to represent an older US, as the US of the 1970s certainly also did not prohibit women from universities, for example-much the opposite.

<ul><li> The series can usually be counted on to examine social problems at some length, yet fell into this trap in Season 4.5. In light of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">recent discoveries</a> the policies of the Adama/Roslin administration are brought into question — the two had fielded an "ends justifies the means" approach to getting to Earth, especially Roslin who followed her visions on blind faith. Even in the midst of the latest scandal, Roslin is irresponsibly letting the government get out of control without allowing another leader to step into power, and Adama is considering allowing the Cylons — the same Cylons that nuked the 12 Colonies and then tormented the population of New Caprica for a year — <em>citizenship</em> into the Colonial Fleet. While Adama may have justification for contemplating this move, the show is right to suggest it, as well as Roslin's childish behavior, deserves to be re-evaluated with care ... however, when Adama and Roslin's opposition turns out to be led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Felix Gaeta</a> and Tom Zarek, who summarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">attempt to kill many of our beloved characters</a> and succeed at killing numerous secondaries, the writers opt for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">different approach</a>. It seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">getting our protagonists into tough spots</a> was not on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">the agenda</a>, after all.
</li><li> There's a recurring theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>, about whether the Cylons are really "alive" and had souls. But according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em>, the Cylons originated when a human's memories and personality are coded into a digital avatar. So basically, the skinjob Cylons have bodies molecularly indistinguishable from humans, and their minds are essentially human minds, and since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em> doesn't end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">with a massive wave of amnesia</a>, the BSG characters should know this from history class. So they are as human as anyone else. Why the hell are even they considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">robots</a> by any criteria except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Karel Capek's?</a>
</li><li> That one seems to be more a case of deliberately dehumanizing them, i.e. refusing to acknowledge Cylons are or could be people (even <em>bad</em> people). It's hardly surprising given the wars both sides fought, and the Cylons having an artificial origin just made it easier.

<ul><li> One prominent example occurs during the first season, when a woman is on trial for bombing an abortion clinic. The moral issues of abortion are debated, even going so far as to polarize the main cast members (and, it's implied, the jury), but then the ADA pulls the rug out during cross-examination by pointing out that, by killing a pregnant woman, the bomber <em>also</em> murdered her unborn child. Cue one guilty verdict.
</li><li> Subverted when a man kills the insurance executive who vetoed an extremely expensive treatment for his terminally-ill daughter. During the trial, the insurance company reverses its position, putting her on the medication and giving strong credibility to the justification that the murder saved his daughter's life. But the judge refuses to allow the jury to hear about this, insisting the trial should be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">an eye for an eye</a>. It ended on a "hopelessly deadlocked" hung jury, and it's strongly implied the DAs aren't going to bother trying again.

The case hinges on whether or not one's own eggs can be legally the property of someone else, for the purposes of establishing the predicate felony. Except during the break-in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cop destroyed another couple's eggs too, but they didn't initially come forward to report the 'loss' for other reasons.</span>

The killer uses the "preservation of life" justification of killing the abortion doctor to save a woman's unborn fetus. McCoy first points out that since the doctor's intended patient was really the killer's partner and her scheduled abortion was a ruse to lure the doctor out that her fetus was never in jeopardy. He then digs up evidence the defendant's motive was revenge against abortion doctors after he failed to prevent the woman carrying his child from getting an abortion. The defendant's spiritual advisor, a pro-life advocate who insists on making a jury debate the value of the "preservation of life" argument, claims he was the defendant's co-conspirator, having provided the gun and transportation for him to kill the doctor. On the stand, he claims the justification defense but McCoy asks him why, if he believes its morally right to kill abortion doctors, did he not just pull the trigger himself instead of giving the gun to the killer? The answer was that no matter how much he decried abortion, he still knew it was wrong to kill anyone, thus he did not believe in his own defense.

Her elderly mother, however, wants to abort, feeling she won't be around long enough to provide for both her daughter and grandchild. The detectives are caught up in the family drama as they search for the rapist... and eventually they do find him, and it turns out he's filthy rich. As such, the police decide to plea bargain him in exchange for lifetime child support, so everyone's happy.
<ul><li> In the same episode, it isn't immediately clear that there <em>was</em> a rape; initially, it appears that the baby may have been fathered by the girl's boyfriend, raising some fairly complex questions about whether or not the woman is capable of giving meaningful consent. All of which goes out the window when both parties insist they never had sex, and it's solidified when detectives discover that it was somebody else who had blatantly taken advantage of her naivete to manipulate her into sex, making it a clear-cut case of rape.

Initially it's about whether to interfere in the natural arrangement of a pre-warp society (a stone-age species is kept in benign slavery by a more advanced one), but then it suddenly turns out that the disease that's been spreading among the dominant species (and for which the crew was helping to find a cure) is a "natural development" of their evolution (which may well "solve" the problem of the stone-age species' subjugation by killing their caretakers). So naturally, the crew decide to give them relief of the symptoms rather than a cure, in a proto-development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Prime Directive</a> (its most appalling application in the entire history of the series, which is ironic as it was intended as a justification for it). And then people wondered why the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise took a breather. <br/><br/>This was actually the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>; in the original script Phlox refused a direct order from Archer to give the species in question the cure he had developed.

</li><li> A better usage was in the episode "Affliction" in which Phlox and the Klingon Doctor Antaak have been tasked with finding a cure for the Klingon Augment Virus which is threatening to wipe out the entire Klingon Empire. Dismayed to see Antaak preparing to euthanize one of the infected test subjects with a lethal injection, Phlox interrupts him and an argument breaks out between them as Antaak insists that giving one's life to save millions is a most honorable way for a Klingon to die while Phlox contends that such a killing is ethically unthinkable. While they're arguing, their boss General K'Vagh pulls his disruptor, calmly shoots the victim, and tells them "Proceed."

The titular character is a symbiont, which is implanted in a humanoid host, and shares experiences and personality. When one host dies, the symbiont is passed onto another, retaining its old memories. The previous host, Curzon, is accused of a crime, and the victim's families want the new host, Jadzia, to be tried and punished for them. The symbiont can't be removed without killing Jadzia, so the episode wrestles with a complex legal and philosophical question of whether the symbiont in its current host is sufficiently the same person as to be culpable for a crime that took place in a different life. Before any resolution is reached, the question is rendered moot by proving that Curzon wasn't guilty of the crime in the first place (and had hidden his alibi because he'd been with his best friend's wife).

Janeway finally manages to get the experiments aborted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">flying Voyager into a pulsar, which is stated to be nearly-certain death, which scares the aliens off and destroys one of their ships that doesn't get away in time. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Voyager survives</a>. The reason this is this trope is that Janeway is only acting that way <em>because</em> of the experiments of the aliens</span>.
</li><li> The Seska arc introduces a wildly complicated question when Seska reveals that she forcibly stole Chakotay's DNA and impregnanted herself with it, and later begs for his help when she and his son are in danger. How he's supposed to respond to that is agonizingly difficult. To the show's credit, they do spend a good deal of time dealing with these questions (Chakotay decides to try and get custody and raise him after the spirit quest version of his father makes the observation that the boy is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>), but they're ultimately rendered moot when it turns out that the child isn't actually Chakotay's after all.

</li><li> In "Shattered," <em>Voyager</em> is split into 37 different timeframes. Chakotay, the only one originating from the proper timeframe, enlists the help of a Janeway from before <em>Voyager</em> was launched into the Delta Quadrant, injecting her with a special chroniton-infused serum so that she can exist in the other timeframes. Along the way, she begins to learn about all of the crazy stuff that's happened to <em>Voyager</em> throughout its run in the Delta Quadrant and blames herself for it. She wants to modify Chakotay's plan to fix things so that all of <em>Voyager</em> is back in the proper timeframe so that it is instead in <em>her</em> timeframe, and thus she can make it so that it never goes into the Delta Quadrant. Chakotay tells her that she's not seeing the big picture - all of the families and relationsships that have formed on <em>Voyager</em> and how everyone's grown. He also says that it's presumptuous of her to think that she has the right to change everyone's future. Yet, in the series finale "Endgame," this is exactly what happens. <em>Admiral</em> Janeway returns from the future with a plan to get <em>Voyager</em> home. There's maybe about two minutes of hand-wringing about the ethics of this at most, with most of the rest of the story spent on the ironing-out and execution of the plan, the upshot being that it works out exactly as intended and <em>Voyager</em> gets home nearly 16 years before it did in Admiral Janeway's timeline.

</li><li> In a way its still played straight. In the end, regardless of whether you sided with Templars or Mages, you still have to kill both Orsino and Meredith when the former uses blood magic to turn into a Flesh Golem and the latter goes insane due to her sword made of Lyrium.
</li><li> Until the aversion comes at the end, however, it's played straight when it comes to the complaints of the Mages. Their complaints are never actually seriously addressed, because most of their arguments are "disqualified" for extenuating reasons. Anders, their primary advocate, is possessed by Justice and is portrayed as irrational, with even freedom advocate Isabela mostly brushing him off, so players can conveniently write him off and ignore anything he says as the words of a crazy abomination. The strongest argument the Mages have, that the Templars treat all Mages the same way and are willing to punish the innocent along with the guilty, is brushed off by Fenris "shifting the burden of proof", and almost every Mage you meet is an insane blood mage trying to kill you. Well, at least pro-Mage players can have their points addressed with Merrill... oh wait, she conveniently turns out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally unleash a Pride Demon on her clan in Act 3. Well, never mind anything <em>she</em> says then.</span>
</li><li> Played straight regarding Hawke's bickering mother and uncle. Leandra is furious that Gamlen didn't tell her he lost the family fortune, then used her new family's distress to sell her kids into indentured servitude to pay off his debts. Gamlen counters that she <em>chose</em> to leave the family fortune behind years ago, left Gamlen to take care of everything, turned up decades later only when she needed something, and is acting entitled and ungrateful for the help Gamlen <em>could</em> offer her. It raises interesting questions of how much Gamlen really owes her and how appreciative Leandra should be. Then Hawke finds out that Leandra's parents actually left her everything and Gamlen stole her inheritance, rendering his side of the argument completely moot.

In the second game, Tali's loyalty mission has you defending her from a charge of treason. In the course of seeking evidence of her innocence, you find a recording revealing that her father was responsible for the crimes she's charged with. She asks you not to use the evidence (which will render her father the worst criminal in quarian history), even though it means permanent exile from her people.

By the end of the game, it is simply assumed by the core cast that all Pokemon are content to be raised by their trainers, and the sole unambiguously heroic member of the organization is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, conveniently allowing the series to avoid bringing the issue up again.

Interestingly, both sides reference the Dark War, and both have good reasons for their chosen outcome. Kokonoe's is purely technical: whereas Bloodedge's sacrifice froze the Beast for one year, use of the Lynchpin could have suspended it for three to five, giving more time to better articulate an effective armed response against it. Ragna's argument is from an emotional standpoint: the whole reason Nine worked so hard on making the Nox Nyctores was because she was trying to get out of sacrificing Celica in the first place, and if Celica had gotten sacrificed, she would have been consigned to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>, with Nine crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> as a result. The argument ends by intervention from Rachel, who reveals that the Nox Nyctores Houyoku: Rettenjo was made as a workaround to fire the Lynchpin, and that it had been loaded recently... with former Imperator Tenjo's soul. This allows both sides to get what they want in the end: Kokonoe gets to fire the Lynchpin to impair Imperator Izanami's operations, and the gang get to keep Celica for the rest of her natural existence... or as natural as a chronophantasma gets, anyway. Another problem related to the debate — that Celica's chronophantasma was evoked for this inevitable endgame — is never addressed.</span>

Specifically how people were separated into two groups as birth; those with a ticket to success (genetic good looks, a good voice, born into a good family, ect), and those who aren't. Those in the latter have no choice but to accept this fact, and work their asses off to make up for not having that "ticket", despite the entire world constantly pushing them down. Society accepts that this is "normal" and that this is how things are meant to be, so anyone who rightfully complains about it is pushed down as a whiner, resulting in the quiet, silent voices of the masses screaming out for a change that is never going to happen. This entire point is never tackled directly by the Investigation Team, who instead essentially tell <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adachi</span> that his opinions don't matter, because he killed two people and endangered several others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.

These points hit even harder during the Okumura arc, where the Phantom Thieves' engineered popularity has caused the public to blindly trust them to solve <em>all</em> society's problems, while they sit back and do nothing. Shortly after this arc, Kasumi accidentally wanders into the Metaverse and awakens to her Persona in front of Joker and Morgana, and from that point on she's fully on-board with the Thieves and their methods, and her initial argument is never mentioned again.

<ul><li> In the second case, Maya is on trial for murdering a doctor while channeling a spirit with a grudge against the latter. In a world where spirit channeling is very much confirmed to be real, this raises interesting questions on whether the channeler can really be held responsible for their actions while under the control of a supernatural entity and even if the latter can even be punished for their actions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course Maya is actually being framed by a normal person who can be convicted and sent to jail like everyone else</span>.

The player even gets the chance to decide the verdict, but no matter what you choose, Franziska von Karma enters the courtroom before Phoenix has a chance to say your choice and offers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingGun">Smoking Gun</a>.

<ul><li> The first season sets up a really interesting question about the premise of the setting, only to ultimately result in this. We're introduced to the Equalists, a group of non-bender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">revolutionaries</a> who feel oppressed by the superpowered benders (and we're shown that powers are used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">in practical contexts</a> as well as combat, so benders would make it hard for non-benders to get jobs as much as it makes them easy targets). Korra doesn't do much to counter their beliefs at first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">being rude, arrogant, and horribly insensitive to them</a> about how awesome bending is, then going on to proudly star in a major sport that requires you to be a bender. While the Equalists resort to greater and greater forms of domestic terrorism, the attitudes of the bender main characters (and bender politicians) only make it easier to understand why the Equalists are so upset. So how is this resolved? By revealing that the Equalists are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> secretly led by a bender</span>. While his motives are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretty honest after all</span>, his defeat is still treated as a resolution to the problem, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his true identity as not just a bender, but a <em>bloodbender</em> (bloodbenders can turn anyone into a puppet or kill them outright, and even block the bending of others), only showed how right he and the Equalists were to feel at the mercy of the dangerously powerful benders</span>. The most attention this is ever given is that a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">non-bender president</span> is installed off-screen between seasons. What certainly doesn't help is that the only non-bender main character is non-powered in much the way that Batman is (in other words, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have a massive fortune and one-of-a-kind brilliant mind that allows them to compensate for a lack of superpowers in a way that cannot be easily imitated</span>).
</li><li> Second season had more minor versions of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unalaq</span> wanted a balance between the human and spirit realms, which Korra would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually let happen anyway</span>, but since his methods involved deception, manufactured civil wars, and unleashing an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">avatar of chaos</span>, little actual debate was had on the matter. Similarly, Vaatu's nature called into debate the methods Korra usually used to solve her problems (namely, force), by being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a being made from and empowered by concepts like aggression and violence (which gave Avatar Wan no other option other than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">seal it away</a>)</span>. So, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being brought low</span>, Korra has a spiritual journey to find a way to beat him... which ends up just being to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beat him into submission like every other villain</span>.
</li><li> Third season has the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red Lotus</span>, a group of anarchists who have some legitimate concerns with the various leaders of the world. In fact, the one leader they manage to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assassinate</span> is an Orwellian tyrant. The fact that they're extremists (to the point where they didn't even think about the consequences of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a power vacuum</span>) allows the characters to mostly ignore even the points they <em>do</em> have (including against the leader they <em>themselves</em> hated). This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">somewhat offset</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">conversation</a> the leader has with Korra in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the next season</span>.
</li><li> The fourth and final season follows up the events of the previous season by tackling the struggle of rebuilding a war-torn nation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuvira</span> desired to rebuild <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth Kingdom</span> and it is later revealed that she was the <em>sole individual willing to take on the task.</em> Her methods are heavily based on military rule, with one of the protagonists being revealed to have been working for her during the time skip. In addition, she refuses to give up her leadership when the other nations wish to re-install a member of the royal family, believing that such an action would undo the past three years of work (which considering the behavior of individual they wished to install, could have very well been the case). The notion of whether any of the actions that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuvira</span> is undergoing could be validated is ultimately rendered moot, when it is revealed halfway through the season that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is building a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a> and has established re-education camps</span>.

Rather than stage an invasion, Guan announces he is planning to run for office, under Prince Wu's new system and then recreate the Earth Empire from the ground up</span>.

Wu initially chooses the latter, and Korra tries to have Kuvira talk down Guan. It doesn't work, and Korra admits it was a long shot. Guan then reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's perfected brainwashing and wants to ensure none of his rivals or opponents can destroy him. He proceeds to attack Team Avatar, brainwash half of them, and do the same to Korra and Kuvira.

<ul><li> The last season of the series shows the League has been given military garrison and regularly has checks from members of the US Government now, and the members of the group agreed they need limitations (like the not keeping a super-zappo-laser on the Watchtower). So yeah, the show didn't skirt the issue and found a reasonable solution - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">at least for the Americans.</a>

After some back and forth, JLord Batman argues "We've made a world where no eight year old boy will ever lose his parents because of some punk with a gun!", prompting JLeague Bats to concede. Then in a later scene, JLeague Batman manages to change his counterpart's mind... by appealing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">his daddy issues</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">The writers admitted that this was because they couldn't come up with a compelling rebuttal.</a>

Applejack wants them driven away so that they leave her crops alone, which brings her into debate with Fluttershy who sympathizes with the bats and insists they need to feed their families and in general are important to the ecosystem. Twilight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption">takes a third option</a> and opts to brainwash them into avoiding the apples and Fluttershy is convinced to help paralyze the bats with her Stare so that Twilight can cast a spell on them. However, because Fluttershy was in the range of the spell, she accidentally gets turned into a vicious fruit-hungry vampire herself. After catching her and bringing her back to normal, Applejack feels guilty that Fluttershy suffered from Twilight's "short-sighted solution" and agrees to make a small separate corner for the bats in her garden... So Fluttershy only ends up being in the right because the spell backfired and chasing them away is no longer a viable solution?

Despite Cetea's plea for help, Superman is hesitant to take them on directly because Jax-Ur and Mala have been cordial to him and of the damage &amp; destruction that would ensue from a Kryptonian vs. Kryptonian brawl.

When Ben is added into the debate it means he'd logically become all powerful because every one of their deadlocks would be broken with what Ben decided to do but then they suddenly start agreeing... to do nothing in opposition to anything Ben says. When Ben calls them out on this, saying that the compassionate personality should want to save lives and the aggressive personality should want to punish evil, compassion starts crying and they completely avoid responding to Ben's complaint.

She was imprisoned by Rose because she advocated the Crystal Gems should make shattering a normal part of warfare. As in the above example, she provides reasons why she believes this is necessary — that it would let them defeat their enemies once and for all and save their allies from having to suffer any further at their hands — but Steven rejects it as morally wrong. Steven is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain">forced to poof her in self-defense</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">the Crystal Gems agree to keep her bubbled after he explains what happened</a>. She only comes back after the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">Debate and Switch</a>, at which point her own debate is deferred by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> where she now says she was only planning to shatter the diamonds and not the rank-and-file.</span> She just agrees it was reasonable that Rose imprisoned her for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">planning to shatter <em>her personally</em></span>, and the original debate of whether it is right to shatter ordinary soldiers is never addressed.
