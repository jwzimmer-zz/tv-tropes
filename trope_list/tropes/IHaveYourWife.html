It's often a significant other, frequently a wife or girlfriend; but any family or friend works, or even strangers if it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">certain type of hero</a>.
</p><p>This sort of thing tends to go in the following sequence:
</p><ol><li> Significant other is kidnapped.
</li><li> Villain calls up hero and says "I've got your significant other. I'll put her on the line".
</li><li> Significant other is expected/ordered to wail "Do as he says!" More often than not, they say something along the lines of "Don't do it, it's a trap!"
</li><li> Villain tells hero that he is being watched. If he doesn't obey orders and/or informs the authorities, then he will kill the significant other.
</li><li> The hero will then be given his orders, usually: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageForMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageForMacGuffin">a) steal something, b) deliver something</a>, c) kill someone, d) surrender to the villain, and/or e) lead his allies into a trap.
</li><li> The hero will try at least once to get a message to friends and usually succeeds (eventually). The friends in turn usually figure out what is going on — that their friend is in great danger, closely watched and controlled by a villain — and swing into action to help.
</li><li> Eventually, the significant other will be released, either by completion of mission or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">rescue</a> by the hero (in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue">Roaring Rampage of Rescue</a>) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a> is sometimes involved.

If the villain is attracted to the hero, he/she may give them the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a>.
</p><p>A common variant used with lone heroes (in which case 6 on the list is not exactly an option) has the hero reluctantly doing what the villain orders him to do, only to be screwed over when the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">reneges on his promise</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSaidYouWouldLetThemGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSaidYouWouldLetThemGo">to let the loved one go</a>, usually before killing the loved one in question in a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment. The result, for many action heroes, is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> that usually culminates in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Storming the Castle</a> and handing the villain the mother of all asskickings for daring to mess with the loved one in the first place. Alternatively, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue">Roaring Rampage of Rescue</a> ending in the rescue of the loved one may also take place.

</p><p>Can't blame many a hero for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">taking precautions</a> against this.
</p><p>Sometimes, of course, the intended target may feel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanKeepHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanKeepHer">You Can Keep Her</a>, in which case the whole thing is moot by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire">Threat Backfire</a>.
</p><p>If this is the reason why the villain is doing it, then it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommiesMadeMeDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommiesMadeMeDoIt">The Commies Made Me Do It</a>.
</p><p>In the real world, a kidnapping committed for the purpose of coercing another person to commit a crime on the original criminal's behalf is called a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_kidnapping">tiger kidnapping<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Most real-life kidnappings, tiger or not, tend to end peacefully, whether or not the victim sees the kidnapper's face. This is largely due to pragmatism, as murder is a far more serious offense than kidnapping. Media usually ignores this because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a>, acting like the victim will be killed the second the ransom is paid.

<ul><li> Interesting subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys">20th Century Boys</a></em>; the bad guys kidnap the daughter of a scientist whose help they need; however <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> over his ensuing years of work, she becomes converted to their side, and is a minor villain throughout the rest of the series.</span>
</li><li> Griffith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> does this with one of the Queen's mooks in order to blackmail him into helping Griffith kill the Queen, only the hostage is the mook's young daughter.
<ul><li> Guts also had a habit of doing this when he was in full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> mode.
</li></ul></li><li> Ichigo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has this done to him twice with Orihime as bait. Though, it was more of a 'We have your friend/ potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>' moment.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, with an exchange that goes something like this (he wasn't holding anyone hostage)
<div class="indent"><strong>Kira:</strong> Guess who I'm holding hostage. <br/><strong><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raye Penber</span>:</strong> ...No! You're holding <em>her</em> hostage? ("her" being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naomi Misora, Penbar's fiancée</span>) <br/><strong>Kira:</strong> (smirks to self) That's right, and I'll kill her unless you do what I say.
</div><ul><li> It's later played straight when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mello kidnaps Light's little sister Sayu. Their father happens to be the head of the team working on the Kira case. Mello specifically mentions that it would be pointless to tell him not to contact the police, because he's in the police. But he does ask him to stop it spreading further.</span>
</li><li> The movie has an odd variation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naomi takes (Light's girlfriend) Shiori hostage, intending to get him to reveal himself as Kira. It turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a> on Light's behalf, with him planning a "murder-suicide" scenario.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Minerva pulls of a twisted version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> when she tells Sting, her <em>ally</em>, that she's holding his closest companion Lector hostage. Because she's just saved Lector's life as well, Sting would already do whatever she wanted - she's just adding the extra punch in the gut to try and make him fight for higher stakes.
</li><li> Done by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> <em>protagonist</em> Kiritsugu Emiya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfferYouCantRefuse">An Offer You Can't Refuse</a>; victim must "exit the stage," so to speak, but both parties sign a magical contract that state said hero cannot harm either wife or husband.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is in love with this trope, at least metaphorically. When Ed and Roy step out of line in the middling chapters, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> crew hold <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Winry and the Mustang Team hostage, respectively. Ed's able to engineer Winry's escape with Scar's help, but Roy can't do much for his men. Riza is taken hostage, as she now works in close proximity with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> crew, and if Roy does anything they don't like her life is forfeit. The others are also in varying sorts of danger.</span> Dr. Marcoh is constantly forced to do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> crew's bidding due to their hostage-taking. It gets so bad that he expresses the desire for death over having to work within the constraints any longer. Toward the endgame, Roy retaliates for the loss of his subordinates by taking a hostage of his own. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Bradley, I have your wife.</span> However, this is later subverted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out that taking Mrs. Bradley hostage was part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> designed to make her realize that her husband and his top generals considered her as expendable as any member of Mustang's crew, followed by a promise from Mustang to keep her safe - which he does.</span>
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> when someone tells Sousuke that they have Chidori kidnapped.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7">Gate 7</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">Tokugawa</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Iemitsu</a> kidnapped the twin sister of one of the Urashichiken's members.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em>, Toutaku wants Hakufu to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill Ryoufou for him</span>.

</li><li> Also early in the series, Kagome is kidnapped by the Thunder Brothers. She convinces them to let her live so they can force Inuyasha to give up the Shikon Jewel shards for her as a ransom. This was a bluff, as her relationship with Inuyasha was still fairly antagonistic at this point, and it leads to this exchange:

In the first example, during <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, Kaolinite figures out Usagi's true identity as Sailor Moon and traps Tuxedo Kamen in glass after taking Usagi's compact. She then demands Usagi meet her at the Tokyo Tower if she wants him back. In reality, she's just baiting a trap to get an opportunity to take Usagi's pure heart, which she believes to have a talisman. Later in the series, Nehellenia possesses Mamoru via a glass mirror shard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">in his eye</a>, and kidnaps him in order to lure Usagi into her realm.
<ul><li> Zoisite <em>loves</em> this strategy in the original anime. Zoisite has his youma kidnap Naru in order to threaten Nephrite, as he's figured out Nephrite is obsessed with her, and tries to ransom her for the Black Crystal using three powerful youma. Nephrite just proceeds to beat up the youma and take Naru back, though Zoisite ends up killing him a little while later anyway. Later in the season, Zoisite uses Naru <em>again</em> to threaten Sailor Moon into giving up the only rainbow crystal the Sailor Senshi have collected, this time by having a youma suffocate her until Sailor Moon gives up and hands it over (though he <em>initially</em> planned to just turn Naru into a youma and threaten her that way, but he missed his attack and hit a Power Ranger parody instead.) Finally, Zoisite captured the Sailor Senshi through a convoluted scheme in order to force Tuxedo Mask to give up the rainbow crystals which <em>he</em> had collected. This is the only time he actually failed because Sailor Venus made her first appearance in this episode, thus avoiding his trap...though he still got information on Tuxedo Mask's true identity in the process.

</li><li> After Ned's execution and Arya's escape, Sansa is essentially used as leverage by the Lannisters against Robb, and is physically and emotionally abused by Joffrey for her brother's victories. Meanwhile, Jaime has been captured by the Starks, who plan to use him as a hostage against Cersei. However, Sansa and Jaime counteract each other's value for this trope. Neither side will truly harm their prisoner for fear of the consequences to their loved one. In the books, this is also the reason why The Mad King kept Jaime in the capitol during Robert's Rebellion, even though all the other White Swords were sent out to fight  Ser Barristan Selmy, Ser Jonothor Darry, and Prince Lewyn Martell of Dorne to the ruby ford, where the latter two died alongside Rhaegar Targaryen; and Ser Oswell Whent, Ser Arthur Dayne, called "Sword of the Morning," and Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, the White Bull himself, to the Tower of Joy in Dorne, where Eddard Stark and his companions slew them whilst trying to rescue Lyanna. Aerys's plans were very straightforward: if House Lannister were to raise its banners in rebellion, Aerys could easily have Jaime killed. The Mad King had already made this threat to Prince Doran Martell  "I have your brother in the Kingsguard AND your sister as my daughter-in-law"  which is why Dorne fought for House Targaryen.

</li><li> Averted with Martyn and Willem Lannister, because they are rather worthless hostages when compared to Sansa.
</li><li> Rhaegar Targaryen's kidnapping of Robert Baratheon's betrothed, Lyanna Stark, is (probably in combination with his father's penchant for burning his vassals) what started Robert's Rebellion. He hid her in a tower in Dorne and appointed a retinue of Kingsguard knights to guard the tower and prevent anyone from entering. In reality, Lyanna fled to Dorne with Rhaegar willingly to get away from Robert, whom she never loved in the first place. Robert, meanwhile, was utterly oblivious to the fact that Lyanna preferred Rhaegar, going so far as to marry him and bear his child. When Rhaegar left to face Robert on the Trident, the Kingsguard were ordered to the Tower of Joy to protect <em>Princess</em> Lyanna Stark and their newborn son, the infant Aegon Targaryen (later Jon Snow).

They do this in order to force Roy Campbell <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(whom the series eventually reveals is her father)</span> to not only cooperate in halting the revolt, but also in keeping secrets from Solid Snake (such as Metal Gear REX's development and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snake being used as a vector for a bioweapon virus known as FOXDIE</span>).

The second time is to Raiden himself: Not only does he have to save Olga's child after she dies in an act of sacrifice, but must continue to live for Rosemary and his own unborn child, as they are holding her hostage, and she's pregnant, and it is implied that even after Raiden succeeds in the exercise, they are still holding them hostage.
</li><li> Something similar is revealed to be the reason why The Sorrow and The Boss fought to the death in Dolinovodno: They had to fight due to The Boss's failure and her unauthorized usage of the Philosopher's spy network; otherwise, the Patriots would have murdered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ocelot - who is the son of The Sorrow and The Boss</span>.

And then Robin puts the nanoprobes in himself when Slade is about to kill his friends, and since they aren't selective, he'd die too.</span>
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">Tripping the Rift</a></em> had Darf Bobo tell one of the judges for his daughter's supermodel contest that he's kidnapped his wife, and if he knows what's good for her, he'll vote for his daughter. Upon seeing the picture Bobo provides for evidence, the judge tells him that's his mother-in-law, and that Bobo's free to kill her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateBookOfSpells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateBookOfSpells">Ultimate Book of Spells</a></em>: In "Shadow Land," the shadow creature working for Zarlak only does so because Zarlak is holding his family hostage.
</li><li> Used in the Goultard special for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>. The villain kidnaps Goultard's wife and children in order to lure him into a fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He kills them before Goultard arrives, and taunts him about it in order to make Goultard angrier. This is actually all part of a plan to get a parasitic demon that feeds off of rage to see Goultard as a more appetizing host and jump from the villain into Goultard. The villain doesn't get to enjoy his new found freedom for long, however, as Goultard kills him immediately afterward.</span>
</li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em>: Agent Lee gets held hostage by a sadistic mercenary threatening to kill her unless Zeta surrenders. Zeta, who she has been chasing, hunting down and treating like he's less than a sentient being, intervenes immediately anyway because that's just the kind of person he is. Setting aside their relationship, though, the rest of the trope is played like this, right down to the mercenary calling Lee Zeta's 'girlfriend' in several dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>: In the season one finale, Zhang threatens Pepper in order to get Tony and Gene to retrieve the fifth Makulan Ring for him. Tony is her best friend and they have mutual crushes on each other. She is also close friends with Gene, who seems to harbor some romantic feelings for her and vice versa. Zhang keeps Pepper hostage while Tony and Gene go into the temple, but she manages to escapes from him and his ninjas.

<ul><li> At some battle during the Chu-Han War after the collapse of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Qin Dynasty</a>, the King of Chu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Xiang Yu</a> eventually captured the father of his rival, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Liu Bang</a>. At one battle, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang faced one another across a ravine. Xiang Yu yells (more or less), "Just give up! I have your father, and I'm going to boil him alive!" Liu Bang famously responded, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">Send me a cup of the soup</a>!"
<ul><li> For the curious, Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu (founding the Han Dynasty in the process), and Liu's father didn't get the least bit boiled.
</li></ul></li><li> Another historical example, this time from 12th century England, concerns King Stephen threatening to hang the small son of one John Marshal if he didn't surrender his castle. John replied, rather crudely, that he still had the hammer and anvil to make even better sons. In justice to John, King Stephen was a coward and everybody knew it. Little William Marshal was <em>not</em> hanged and grew up to be the most famous knight in England and France.
</li><li> During the Spanish Civil War, the Republicans (no, not those Republicans) captured the son of José Moscardó e Ituarte, the Nationalist commandant during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_Alc&lt;!--C3--&gt;A1zar">Siege of Alcázar.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The Republican forces called Moscardó on the telephone, and demanded he surrender or they would kill his son. Moscardó asked to speak to his son, whom he told: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourUltimatum">"Commend your soul to God and die like a patriot,</a> shouting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayYourPrayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayYourPrayers">'Long live Christ King'</a> and 'Long live Spain.'" His son's reply? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">"That, I can do."</a>
</li><li> It's been said that in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> era, those with families were the first to "confess" to being "spies."
</li><li> The German government tried to use this tactic against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> after his son Yakov was captured as a prisoner of war during World War II. The Germans offered to release Yakov in exchange for captured German Field Marshall Friedrich Paulus. Stalin refused, responding "I will not trade a Marshal for a Lieutenant." Yakov later died in a POW camp under unclear circumstances, either by suicide or being shot by camp guards.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai">Sengoku Jidai</a>, the Matsudaira Clan attempted to form a alliance with the Imagawa Clan, and one of the requirements was for the Matsudaira Daimyo to send his son to live in the Imagawa capital of Sunpu as hostage. This the Matsudaira dutifully did; unfortunately, the boy was captured by the Oda Clan en route to Sunpu. The Oda, mortal enemies of the Imagawa, threatened to kill the boy unless the Matsudaira broke their alliance with the Imagawa. However, the Matsudaira called their bluff, and essentially dared the Oda to kill the boy, as that would demonstrate to the Imagawa how seriously they took their alliance. Unsure of what to do, the Oda detained the boy (in safety and comfort) for three years and eventually returned him to his father. The boy later grew up to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, and the rest is Japanese History.
</li><li> A robbery technique involved calling a bank manager's wife at home and convincing her not to answer the phone for some reason (e.g. claiming to be a telephone company working on the line, which would cause the phone to ring at random). They would then call the bank manager and use this trope, telling him to fill a suitcase full of money and meet them in ten minutes or else. The manager would try to call home and of course, when there was no answer, he would assume the worst.
<ul><li> A similar ploy has targeted university students studying abroad, who are told not to contact their families in any way (including social media) and to go into hiding. The students' families (who are typically wealthy) are then contacted and told that the student has been kidnapped, and demand a large ransom for their release.
