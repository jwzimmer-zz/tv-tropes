There also was an alternate version of the Napolean wars, where Napoleon conquered Great Britain, making all the British aristocracy run to America, creating the Britannia Empire.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> there is the Mainland, a continent where two nations have been waging war constantly for decades. No main character ever gets to visit the mainland, and we only knows about it through descriptions, however it is revealed that one of these two nations is allied with the Dragon Descendants, powerful creatures much stronger than Humans, and that the nation opposed to the Dragon Descendants <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">created the Organization to develop monsters and creatures able to fight the Dragons, the Organization took over the Island and created all the Yoma and Awakened Being using Dragon's flesh as part of a giant Research project, we know all this thanks to Rubel who's a spy of the Dragon Nation infiltrated within the Organization</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has the first three Shinobi World Wars; though they play a major role in the backstories of a good chunk of the main cast, we still know very little about these conflicts outside of a few offhand mentions and short flashbacks, plus a single gaiden story starring Kakashi.

The series itself is about a team working to help repair all the damage that was inflicted on their country during the war.
</li><li> The war between the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spiral Warriors and the Anti-Spirals</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>. Parallel Works #8 details this a little focusing on Lordgenome's involvement.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> several wars broke out a few days after the Second Impact, one of which resulted in the destruction of Tokyo.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Shinigami and Quincies have been opposed for over a millennium with two periods of warfare being very important for the main storyline. The first is the original war between Yhwach and Yamamoto that occurred a thousand years ago and led to the creation of the Quincy Clan and the Gotei 13. The second is the Shinigami's attempted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">purge</a> of the Quincies 200 years ago. Both wars significantly impact the present-day Quincies and Shinigami, including anyone they associate with, be they human or hollow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, the backstory tells of a massive war between the Zentradi and a group known as the Supervision Army. This also forms a big part of the plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em>, where we learn more about what the Supervision Army is and where it came from. The war is actually on-going, and has been for something like 20,000 years, with the Zentradi and Supervision Army having been almost exactly evenly matched from the start. Many Zentradi fleets are still actively engaged in battle against Supervision Army forces far outside of the Milky-Way galaxy, and are far too busy to take note of humanity's affairs. Fortunately for the humans, both groups seem to be largely fragmented, and haven't noticed humanity destroying/assimilating various Zentradi fleets as their civilization expands. The growing human-"cultured" Zentradi alliance commonly skirmish against both forces, but the New United Nations have yet to run afoul of another one of the larger armadas, and already have colonies spread across roughly a third of the Milky Way galaxy.
</li><li> There was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> fought on Earth that led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">One World Order</a>. Though the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em> covers some characters' actions in it, most of the factions and causes are kept vague.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> has the Windermerean war for independence, which took place a few years before the story. Windermere did succeed in securing their independence from the New UN, but are still bitter over the lives lost... especially over the fact that a Fold Bomb was detonated on Windermere during the conflict.
</li></ul></li><li> Heavens War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> serves as the backstory for most of the main characters, and is the driving force behind Hei's actions <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his sister Pai disappeared at the end when Heavens gate exploded, and Hei is trying desperately to find her.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em> has the Seven Days of Fire, in which the God Warriors were unleashed on the world and industrial civilization was destroyed.
</li><li> Something like this was suggested in the dub version (but not the original version) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>. When Bommer summons his Flying Fortress SKY FIRE to use against Crow, Crow is naturally freaked out (as most of Bommer's opponents are when he summons it) and exclaims "That's not a monster, that's World War IV!" The implication, of course, is that World War III has occurred in the time period between the present day and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">this future time.</a>
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em>, where the war isn't so much off-screen as that the narrator completely forgets to mention it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em>: The Seventh Space War, which ended in a mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>, devastating Earth, wiping out 90% of the human population, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">causing a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt">calendar change</a>. We see a few scenes from it, and meet a few survivors of the war, though the focus is more on the characters trying to build a new world on the ashes of the old, and prevent an Eighth War from starting up in the meantime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> has the final conflict of the Dark History. There's very little known of it, except that it was apparently so nasty that all the space colonies pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a>, and the pilot of the Turn A Gundam felt the need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">wipe out all civilization on Earth</a> (though his/her reasons for doing so are never stated... for obvious reasons, very few records of that time survive).

Records of the time are sparse, but it is known that most of the space colonies were either destroyed or left, Earth's environment was ruined, and there was a severe famine that caused even more death. Most of the current society under the rule of Capitol Tower is kept in line out of fear of ever risking such a disaster again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em> has the Calamity War fought 300 years prior, which was so devastating that it caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitSoHardTheCalendarFeltIt">a change in calendar</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetonationMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetonationMoon">blew up most of the Moon</a>. It was apparently fought between humanity and automated, self-repairing, and self-supplying drone superweapons called Mobile Armors, which killed a quarter of the human population at the time.

When the series begins, the three sides have struck an uneasy truce because the last bout of the war very nearly wiped out all three sides (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and resulted in the deaths of both the four Demon Kings of Hell and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> Himself!</span>). Many of the series villains are members of one side or another who wish to continue the conflict, regardless of the potential extinction of their faction.
</li><li> The Joui War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> is often referenced throughout the series and many notable characters take part in it, though only a few flashbacks are shown at best.

Characters make plenty of references to it, but the fact that the story takes place on Earth (which is an established demilitarized zone) means that it's never shown. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The one time that the plot heads to the other world, the battle that would have taken place is avoided thanks to Kobayashi's intervention.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoJihen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoJihen">Kemono Jihen</a></em>, the eponymous Kemono Jihen was a major war between Kemono and humans a thousand years ago. The resulting devastation convinced Kemono to hide themselves from humans and erase the memory of their existence from humanity, allowing themselves to fade into myth and obscurity. The point of Kemono offices like Inugami's is to allow Kemono to live peacefully among humans while preventing needless conflict that could ignite tensions on both sides.

<ul><li> The First Great War, which happened several million years before the comics. We don't know much about it, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">Nova Prime</a> and his allies managed to bring it to a peaceful conclusion leading the Cybertronion Golden Age.

</li><li> The Lava Wars, again, we know next-to-nothing about this one. Apparently it was caused by a guy called Magma.
</li><li> The war amongst the Stentarians between the Ammonites and Terradores. It's apparently ongoing, is older than all the other known galactic wars, and caused The Shattering, which eventually led to the formation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">the Galactic Council</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a> has the aptly named Great War between the Mobians and Overlanders (aka. the descendants of humanity). It was started when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> Kodos killed two scouts from both sides and sent them to their respective sides, causing some seriously long-standing racial tensions to explode. It lasted for five years and ended when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Robotnik</a> (back when he was still called Kintobor) supposedly switched sides and gave the Mobians what they needed to drive back the Overlanders. Unfortunately, after the Mobians won, Robotnik promptly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">betrayed them</a></em> too and overthrew the king with his badnik army. Many of the comic's older characters were in the war and there's still plenty of resentment and bigotry left over from the war.
<ul><li> There's also the first year of the Second Robotnik War, which saw Dr. Eggman regain his power base and promptly retake Mobius after Sonic had been thought killed in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> and the continuation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SonicTheComicOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SonicTheComicOnline">Sonic the Comic  Online!</a></em> has the Great War between the Echidnas of Megopolis City and the Drakons of the invading Drakon Empire which took place eight thousand years ago over Mobius' Emerald mines which could contain the Chaos energy, a powerful but highly unstable energy source created by scientists on Drak the Drakons home planet, the Drakons were able to steal seven Emeralds before the war began. The gems, when combined with the Chaos energy, formed the legendary Chaos Emeralds. Two days before the war began, Pochacamac, leader of the Megopolis tribe, managed to steal the sacred Emeralds back from the Drakons, both to keep to return them to their true home and to prevent the Drakons from conquering the entire galaxy. Angered, the Drakons sent out a scout to examine the Echidna defenses before sending a full-scale invasion force to claim the Emeralds. A battle erupted inside Pochacmac's command room, with Drakon Prosecutors and Sentinels fighting against Sonic the Hedgehog and echidnas armed with Guardian Robots. The fight was briefly interrupted when a Prosecutor struck the Emeralds with his Dimensional Staff, causing a chain reaction that turned a fallen Drakon warrior into the mighty Chaos. The ensuing explosion weakened the gathered Drakon soldiers enough for Knuckles and the other tribesmen to fight back while Sonic and Pochacmac took care of Chaos. After a final push, the echidnas drove the Drakon invaders out of the city, but the war was far from over. Although no victor was ever declared, the failure of the Drakons to claim their intended prize suggests the Mobian defence held out, albeit at a great cost.
</li><li> Continuing the trend, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogIDW">Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)</a></em> partially deals with the aftermath of a rebellion against Eggman's army, referencing the one that took place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em>. The machinery, social impact, and reconstruction efforts are very much present throughout the comic.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> universe, the Great Atom War/World War Three started off as this, with only a few incidents in it ever being revealed. However, nearly 30 years later the storyline Origins came along and averted this trope, giving a solid order to events and how they were seen through a long Joe Dredd's eyes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> has a number of these, as a result of major league world building and the sheer scale of the setting.
<ul><li> The War of the Nine Realms, between the Alliance of Realms and Surtur, over a million years before the present.
</li><li> The War for the Dawn, between Asgard and her allies and the Dark Elves, about 6000 years prior to the present when the Dark Elves tried to destroy the Nine Realms with the Aether, and rearrange them with the Dark Elves on top.
</li><li> The Avalon Wars, a series of wars between Asgard and Avalon, as the followers of the two respective pantheons clashed, and the two pantheons wound up on collision course (though it's implied that the Avalonians fired the first shot, lashing out at what they saw as encroachment by the followers of the Asgardian gods and Christian missionaries). It ended when the Frost Giants invaded and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> ensued, but it's heavily implied that Asgard was winning and the Avalonians are still carrying a grudge.
</li><li> The Last Great Frost Giant War, with Asgard, Avalon and their human allies (including the ancestors of the founders of Hogwarts) on one side, and the Frost Giants on the other, circa 500 AD. The Avalonians were swept aside early by the might of the Casket (something which Odin puts down to them having been weakened by fighting Asgard), the ancestors of the Founders rallied for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a>, before Asgard played the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> and saved the day. A long war ensured, a world war, and the allied forces won, the Frost Giants were stripped of the Casket of Ancient Winters and Loki was adopted by Odin. Odin's descriptions to Harry of what happened make it sound pretty spectacular, with notable incidents including Aethelstan Gryffindor dueling Laufey with 'swords and magic' and losing a hand (he eventually took up Mjolnir), while leaving scars to remember him by, Prospero Slytherin wielding the wand Laevaeteinn (which is heavily implied to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a fragment of the Phoenix</span>) in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> so spectacular it retroactively carved out the Grand Canyon.

The exact details of the war are not clear as the Terms which ended the hostilities also rewrote much of the Goa'uld racial memory of what happened.

Nothing of the war is actually shown (until the prequel story <em>Warfare</em>, which describes the war in the form of journal entries written by the protagonist, a Royal Guard), but it's stated to have gone on for five years, with both sides sustaining heavy losses (humanity lost at least half of their population and several cities/countries destroyed while Equestria lost the Crystal Empire, three of its princesses and most of its military forces).

Many alien superheroes who were once praised as champions for good like the Martian Manhunter and Starfire were either ousted, forced into hiding, or killed out of sheer paranoia. Those closely associated with them, like Renegade, were treated similarly. Izuku himself is plagued with self-loathing at the start of the story for being an alien, which is only compounded by his lasting guilt complex.

As farcical as the entire movie is, it could very well have been some other war entirely though. Hell it could be a war they (or Ted) completely made up as well. In one scene Ted starts having flashbacks which are represented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> going farther and farther back, all the way through World War I biplanes and finally the Wright brothers test flight.

</li><li> The war against Gellert Grindelwald is even more obscure. All we know for sure is that it apparently took place around the same time as World War II. Fanon consensus is that Grindelwald and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> had some sort of alliance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the timeframe and location of the war against Grindelwald are not a coincidence, but is vague on whether this was just a deliberate parallel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> by the author or an indication that they were actually the same war.

Hardly any details are revealed about the war. The beginning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> <em>Night Watch</em> shows a battle between two groups of barbaric-looking people without using any magic (the director hates magic), with each group consisting of two dozen men at most. This is likely meant to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic">symbolic</a>, though.
<ul><li> Later novels flesh out more details. In <em>The Last Watch</em>, Anton sees a vision of a battle that took place long ago that ended when Gesar and Rustam used a spell devised by Merlin to collapse the layers of the Twilight in a certain area, turning both the Dark Others and their human armies into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">living statues</a>.

He did let other writers go back and fill that in later, though.
</li><li> The aptly-named Vague War in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LineOfDelirium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LineOfDelirium">Line of Delirium</a></em>, which takes place decades prior to the novel. Many references are made to the war, but few details are revealed. Apparently, it was a big free-for-all with all known races but no alliances. The war led to the formation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Human Empire</a>. The author even throws in a funny story about humans spreading misinformation about their dietary needs (i.e. that we need spinach to survive). The aliens spend resources developing a spinach-killing virus and lose countless ships spreading it throughout the human worlds. When humans don't die, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">surrender out of shock</a>. On a less funny note, good luck finding spinach after the war.
</li><li> The Aiel War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> is mentioned in passing by numerous veteran Warders, Tam al'Thor, and others. Many other wars — the Breaking of the World, the War of a Hundred Years, Artur Hawkwing's war of consolidation — all serve to create rich background for the series.
<ul><li> The ending at least of the Aiel War was covered in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> novel, <em>New Spring.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRising">Red Rising</a></em> trilogy has three:
<ul><li> The Conquering, which took place roughly 736 years before the start of the original novel. The original Golds who colonized Luna, weary of paying heavy taxes to Earth-based corporations, declared their independence, turned around, and conquered Earth.
</li><li> The Dark Revolt, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMook">Obsidian</a> caste rebelled against their Gold masters a little less than three centuries after the Conquering. The rebellion was unsuccessful, and 90% of the Obsidian population was exterminated. To prevent future rebellions, the Obsidians were stripped of all technology and banished to the poles of planets and moons, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">tribal shamans</a> encouraged the superstition that the Golds were gods, a fact which Golds masquerading as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Nordic deities</a> deliberately reinforced.
</li><li> More recently was the first Moon Lords' Rebellion, which began fifty-five years before the start of the trilogy, when the moons of Saturn rebelled against the Core after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Octavia au Lune</a> usurped her father as Sovereign. The war lasted for twenty years and did not end until The Ash Lord destroyed Rhea, the moon which had instigated the rebellion, with nuclear warheads, killing millions. Up until the second book of the trilogy, the glassy ruins of Rhea in the night sky and their children held as political hostages on Luna was enough for Octavia to keep the Moon Lords in line. After the Augustan alliance shatters at the end of Golden Son, the outer moons of the solar system declare their independence once more. Though their second rebellion does not do well, the revelation that Octavia had been keeping enough nuclear weapons to repeat what the Ash Lord did to Rhea if necessary convinces the Moon Lords to form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">temporary alliance</a> with the Rising to defeat the Sovereign's forces.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReynardCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReynardCycle">The Reynard Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the outset of the series, there has been a civil war raging in Arcasia for over a hundred years. The Countess Persephone's father was slain in it, Duke Nobel proved his skill as a military commander during it, and Bruin, Tiecelin, and Grymbart fought in it, occasionally referencing battles, camp life, what the weather was like before an engagement, etc. The war drove an entire region to famine so extreme that its people had to resort to <em>eating their own children</em>, and yet it's over before page one of <em>Reynard the Fox</em>.
</li><li> More cryptically, there are occasional references to "The Glyconese Rebellion", an ancient war in which <em>dragons were involved.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">The Sword of Truth</a></em> series, many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a>, events and plots of the entire series are a result of the direct influence of the events in the Great Wizard War that happened over 3000 years ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> has many of these. The most important is Robert's Rebellion, which is really the cause for all of the events in the series - giving the effect that the reader has plunged into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">the middle of the story</a> rather than the beginning. More recently, there was Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion. Further back in time, we had the Targaryen Conquest and the War of the Ninepenny Kings. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg">Tales of Dunk and Egg</a></em> prequel series features the fallout of the Blackfyre Rebellion. Going even further back then that, back to mythic times, there are the stories from various cultures about a great battle between good and evil, implied to be an earlier war with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Others.</a>
<ul><li> What Tywin Lannister did to inspire "The Rains of Castamere". "But there are no Reynes and Tarbecks"... "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity">Exactly</a>."
<ul><li> Most of these are elaborated upon either as the series put out new books, or as supplemental materials were released. For instance, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldOfIceAndFire">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a></em> we learn about the circumstances behind Robert's Rebellion (a Targaryen prince stole Robert's betrothed, but his father also murdered the current Lord of House Stark at the time, and his heir), the War of the Ninepenny Kings (the last of the Blackfyres and a group of bandit-kings warred against Westeros in the Stepstones and the Essos realm of Lys), and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> between two branches of House Targaryen, the greens and blacks, which became the Dance of Dragons. As for Tywin Lannister and the Reynes and Tarbecks, we also find out about what he did (beat them militarily and burned Tarbeck Hall to the ground, and then trapped the Reynes in a mine and redirected a river to drown them).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>:
<ul><li> Admiral Theisman's purge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> forces which refused to fall in line with the new government after the overthrow of the Committee of Public Safety. The only part of it shown is from <em>The Fanatic</em>, which itself took place away from the meat of the action. Not a typical example, as that particular conflict took place between two of the later books of the series.
</li><li> Earth's "Final War" many centuries before the current timeline, where the planet was nearly rendered completely uninhabitable until several colonies sent aid to repair the damage.

There is also an even older event implied to be a nuclear war, which is why the series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> in the first place.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">Star Trek: New Frontier</a></em> series, Calhoun and Picard (and their crews) discover that a species that's apparently been friendly — the Selelvians — is actually capable of an insidious level of mind control which they've hidden successfully up until this point. In the next book in the series, there's been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> of several years and the Selelvians have been defeated after a fairly vicious war.
</li><li> The war is also this trope in the "mainstream" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse">novel 'verse</a>. We know that it indeed happened (between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVulcansSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVulcansSoul">Star Trek: Vulcan's Soul</a></em> and the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVoyagerRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVoyagerRelaunch">Star Trek: Voyager Relaunch</a></em>), off near the Tholian border, but other than a couple of offhand mentions it's not yet been visited.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Triplanetary</a></em> mentions the first and fourth Jovian Wars, which resulted in the formation of the Triplanetary League from Venus, Tellus, and Mars.

Eddison's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWormOuroboros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWormOuroboros">The Worm Ouroboros</a></em>, in which all the civilized ("polite") nations of the world of Mercury fought alongside each other, and that ended just shortly before the book's storyline begins.

</li><li> Some kind of great war is implied to be happening in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies">Lord of the Flies</a></em>. The reason the children are on the island is because the plane that was evacuating them from a soon-to-be-nuked Britain was shot down.
</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BarnabyGrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BarnabyGrimes">Barnaby Grimes</a></em> books mentions a war that was fought (possibly still being fought) to the East, in "The Malabar Kush". It included events such as "the siege of Rostopov", "the fall of Dhaknow", and "the storming of the Great Redoubt".
</li><li> Stewart Cowley's "Terran Trade Authority Handbooks" opening opus, <em>Spacecraft: 2000-2100AD</em> purports to be an identification guide of the spacecraft of that era (it's essentially one-page profiles based on spacecraft pictures by illustrators such as Chris Foss and Peter Elson). The smaller ships of the Proxima Wars - Earth and Alpha Centauri vs. Proxima Centauri - from all three races fill the military section, and there are hints of major fleet actions between capital ships early in the conflict. While a few specific battles are touched on in terms of detailing the service histories of the ships that fought them, and the civilian ships built in the wars' aftermath add a smattering of their own history, a full history of the entire war does not exist. There were to have been further TTA handbooks as part of an early 21st Century attempt to reboot the franchise, but these seem to have gone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> and this troper (a BIG fan as a child) has not been able to locate any of them.
<ul><li> Cowley played the game again in the follow-on <em>Great Space Battles</em>. One of the ships in the ancient fleet which is resurrected to save humanity when its enemies show a disturbing ability to hack the battle computers of the sophisticated frontline ships (and yes, this predates the reboot <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> by DECADES) is described as being a veteran of 'countless' Imperial policing actions - but we never get to find out what these are, even though they are serious enough that battleships were required.

</li><li> <em>A Dry, Quiet War</em> by Tony Daniel. The protagonist returns to his home planet after fighting a war twelve billion years in the future at the end of time, apparently to hold back the spread of entropy so the universe has a chance to exist in the first place. He deliberately says as little as possible about the war because to discuss what happened would risk creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox">Grandfather Paradox</a>, and he'd have to return to the future to fight all over again.

Immediately before those two, there was the Sino-Roman war and the Roman-Mongolian war, and all three lasted from around the 1900s to 1953, with a nuclear bombing of Japan and the "Peninsula" (Korea) followed by a long, bloody invasion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeekersOfTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeekersOfTheSky">Seekers of the Sky</a></em> makes references to major conflicts between this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>'s powers, mainly between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the State</a> and the Russian Khanate (it's mentioned that this world had it own version of the Napoleonic Wars). There are also mentions of occasional conflicts between the State's American colonies and the Aztec Empire. There is also the war that brought the British Isles under the State's control.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BasLagCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BasLagCycle">Bas-Lag Cycle</a></em> has had a few:
<ul><li> The destruction of the ancient Ghosthead Empire, which had been founded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a> wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic">probability magic</a> so powerful that the site of their arrival on the planet remains a combination <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate">Hellgate</a>; relics like "Possible Towers" and "Possible Swords" are scattered in hidden places across the world.
</li><li> The Malarial Queendom of the Anophelii was all but exterminated and its few survivors sequestered on a small island, where the mosquito-like females' insatiable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> can be controlled.
</li><li> New Crobuzon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> ended in the Pirate Wars against two rival city-states, to which New Crobuzon retaliated with an attack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Torque-bombs</a> that twisted the ruins of Suroch into a teratogenic wasteland.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AeonLegionLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AeonLegionLabyrinth">Aeon Legion</a> fought a number of these like the First Temporal War against a people called the Kalians over who would police <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. Also the Faceless War fought against parasitic monsters called the Faceless. The Legion is still struggling to recover from the Faceless War.
</li><li> Most of the large-scale conflicts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> are glossed over with few details given. Even if a story is taking place during an interstellar war, the protagonist is likely to be involved on its fringes. This includes the four Void Wars against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Faata</a> (taking place over the span of a century), the war with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Dromi</a> (which lasts for at least 150 years due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">sheer numbers of the enemy</a>), as well as the smaller conflicts against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Kni'lina</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Haptors</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara">Shannara</a></em> books mention the First War of the Races. It's only mentioned briefly as being a huge war where the rebel Druids and the race of Man fought the Druids and the other races (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome and Troll). Men were defeated, but the war had far-reaching consequences. However, none of the books at present actually tell the story of the war itself such as what caused it, the major battles and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy">The Kharkanas Trilogy</a></em> has a few:
<ul><li> The story happens just a few years after the Forulkan War, which is often referenced but never explicitly shown. Almost all characters have in some way been influenced by it, be it through participating or losing a good chunk of their families to it, and the entire population of Kurald Galain has been decimated; some noble houses are almost gone. All that is shown for certain is that the Tiste won.
</li><li> Either parallel to or shortly after the Forulkan War, the war against the Jhelarkan happened, but even less is shown of that even though it must have happened recently enough that the Jhelarkan are still licking their wounds and have yet to deliver the promised hostages as of the start of the first volume.
</li><li> At the end of the second volume a far more ancient war is hinted at. It's supposed to have been scarily similar to the current civil war, hinting that history is repeating itself, but that's all that is said about it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em>, being a ten-volume doorstopper series with a millennia-spanning backstory, also has a couple:
<ul><li> The so called Jaghut War on Death is said to have happened millennia ago. The only source of information on that is an undead dragon in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds">eighth book</a>, who claims that it happened and brought the Jaghut — usually a solitary bunch prone to becoming hermits — together in entire armies, as well as allies from almost every race inexistence at that time. High King Kallor, who's old enough to have seen the Jaghut in their prime, has never heard of that war and refuses to believe the dragon. The trope is, however, later averted in the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy">The Kharkanas Trilogy</a></em>, where it happens onscreen, but is still in play for the main series.
</li><li> The civil war that sundered the Tiste homerealm of Kurald Galain is often references but barely ever shown, and what little information there is tends to contradict itself. All that's certain is that it destroyed Kurald Galain and caused the three Tiste peoples to evacuate into other realms, and was caused by Mother Dark turning away from her children. Again, this one is averted in the prequel trilogy, but remains in play in the main series.
</li><li> The extermination war in which the T'lan Imass decided they'd had enough of being ruled over by the Jaghut Tyrants and vowed to hunt the latter into extinction is also often referenced and important for the setting's backstory, but only bits and pieces of information are given to the reader. This one happened at least three hundred thousand years before the main story.
</li><li> Another extermination war with even less information available is that of the Forkrul Assail against the followers of the god best known as the Errant. It reduced the Errant's power drastically and himself from the local top god to skulking the shadows. And that's pretty much all that is known about it. Other than that he is still smarting tens of thousands of years later.
</li><li> The Forkrul Assail — they love their war mongering — invasion of the sub-continent of Kolanse is very sparsely explained, but being important to the series' backstory, it is referenced quite often once introduced. They showed up in their ships, took over, caused a famine and have been lording over Kolanse ever since. How exactly they managed to gain control over several kingdoms can only be inferred thanks to their particular style of magic.
</li><li> The various conquests of the Malazan Empire are mostly only referenced, chiefly among them the conquests of the continents of Korelri and Genabackis (only the tail-end of which is shown) and the sub-continent of Seven Cities. The latter plays the bigger role in the backstory of the series as it provides the reasons for the Whirlwind Rebellion that happens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates">second volume</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>:
<ul><li> Several stories in the Future History 'verse refer to the "Wet Firecracker War", particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDoorIntoSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDoorIntoSummer">The Door into Summer</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets">Between Planets</a></em>, his protagonist refers to "the great field, still slightly radioactive, where Old Chicago used to be." It is not known if this is a result of the Wet Firecracker War or some other incident.
</li><li> His near-immortal protagonist, Lazarus Long (a.k.a. Woodrow Wilson Smith) mentions having participated in several wars on nearly as many planets.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreNorton">Andre Norton</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlagueShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlagueShip">Plague Ship</a></em>, the <em>Solar Queen</em> lands on Earth in the middle of a radioactive wasteland. The few clues given indicate that this is all that remains of central Europe, destroyed in a nuclear war a long time ago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign">The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign</a></em>, the Secret War. It's referred to several times as the reason for much of the chaos in the world. No longer offscreen after the fifth volume, which reveals the lead-up to the war and the war itself.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienInASmallTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienInASmallTown">Alien in a Small Town</a></em> apparently experienced two of these, the Genomic War - which gave rise to a number of genetically engineered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a> who have had varying degrees of success interacting peaceably with baseline humans in the years since — and the Android Uprising, about which we are given even fewer details, but the current society seems to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo">Androids Are People, Too</a>. The biggest effect of the Genomic War on the main story is that it apparently caused the Amish and Mennonites to have to evacuate their territories for a time, and when they finally returned, they were somewhat less closed minded than they had been, and a number of outsiders followed them, making them a much more ethnically diverse group than they had been.
</li></ul></li><li> Conspicuously averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>. Hugo takes a break from telling his story to go into a <em>very</em> extensive and detailed history lesson on the Battle of Waterloo. He finally ties it into the main story at the very end of the battle by revealing a relationship between two characters that really could have been summarized in a sentence or two. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thénardier was looting the bodies and encountered Marius's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a> father, saving his life and thus causing Marius to initially believe that Thénardier is a war hero rather than a total scumbag.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkyJumpers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkyJumpers">Sky Jumpers</a></em>: Forty years prior, General Shadel made an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, which was largely unopposed due to the Worldwide Nuclear Disarmament Act eighteen years before THAT. Ultimately, a new type of bomb was created in the hopes of stopping Shadel, the Green Bomb. Unfortunately, Shadel had managed to get hold of how to build those himself, and fired his bombs at America's ally nations. Of course, America fired their green bombs at him, ending his campaign. Unfortunately, much of society was destroyed in the process.
</li><li> One of these is mentioned at the very end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain">Chronicles of Prydain</a></em>, when Dallben explains that he came across the aftermath of a tremendous battle in which everyone had been killed, including civilians. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The only survivor was the infant boy he found hidden among the roots of a tree; Dallben took him home, named him Taran, and raised him. He tells the story to explain that he kept Taran's parentage from him not because he didn't want the boy to know it, but because he himself has no idea who Taran's parents were.</span>
</li><li> Somewhat ironically, the war in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar">The Forever War</a></em> happens almost entirely offscreen. Time dilation due to near-lightspeed travel means the protagonist misses the vast majority of the war, only finding out what has happened and how technology has changed when they arrive back at base decades or centuries later than when they left. The war lasts over a thousand years, in which time the protagonist completes four years of military service, almost all of it travel time.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ZodiacSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ZodiacSeries">Zodiac Series</a></em>, the Trinary Axis is brought up quite a few times. To put it simply, a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> (Blazon Logax of House Leo and Brianella Amarise of House Cancer) decided to secede from the Zodiac, convincing Vecily Matador of House Taurus to join them. Things escalated from there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unsurprisingly, the immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Aquarius</a> laid the seeds for it (though its heavily implied it was unintentional on his part).</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtsOfDarkAndLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtsOfDarkAndLight">The Arts of Dark and Light</a></em> has the war against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord">Witchkings</a> a number of centuries back, which broke the back of the kingdoms of the elves and enabled the rise of the human states of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Savondir</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">Amorr</a> as the main great powers of the setting. Whether seen as history (by the humans) or living memory (by the elves), everyone still recognizes how important the war was. In the setting, it's treated much like World War II is in real life, as a great defining political and cultural event, and the Witchkings are still invoked in rhetoric as the one supreme great evil, somewhat like a sort of fantasy version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Godwin's Law</a>.

<ul><li> The war with the Magogs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em>, the end of which caused the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Nietzschean</a> revolution, may count too, as it started at the beginning of the first episode. The episode then jumps 300 years in the future, to the main plot, not only skipping the downfall of the revolution, but also the civil war among the ones who caused it, the High Guard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>
<ul><li> The Dilgar War, the first major interstellar war that the humans got involved in, as well as the previous Shadow War, which took place around a thousand years previously. We do see a glimpse of that era, mostly just some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology">less advanced looking</a> Minbari ships, but nothing of the war itself.
</li><li> Also the Telepath War. We are shown only before and after.
</li><li> And the first Narn war for independence from the Centauri, about 100 years prior to the beginning of the series.
</li><li> Along with the numerous wars the Centauri Republic was waging with its neighbors in the third season, none of which are seen, or indeed the numerous smaller wars between the members of the League of Nonaligned Worlds in the same season.
</li><li> There are also allusions to various minor conflicts that the Earth Alliance took part in. Not to mention the Earth Minbari War, which we heard much about, but saw little of, until the prequel movie <em>In The Beginning</em>.
</li><li> Also, the Drakh War, of which we see practically nothing due the spin-off telling it getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>.
</li><li> Other important conflicts are the <em>other</em> Shadow Wars, the war against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Thirdspace Aliens</a>, the one against whoever created The Hand (purpoted to be the Thirdspace Aliens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>), and the genocidal war between the Centauri and their co-worlder race the Xon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a> by Garibaldi in an introspective moment in season 5 as things move towards war with the Centauri. To paraphrase, he wonders aloud why we always divide history by the wars, not by the periods of peace, and comes to the conclusion that wars are just more fun.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in one episode when Marcus &amp; Dr. Franklin were being smuggled to Mars. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">Earth Alliance</a> kept out of the Vorlon-Shadow war, so from the perspective of most humans this is the case. Marcus even (sarcastically) lamented coming home as a war hero in a war nobody ever heard about.
</li></ul></li><li> Both series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattlestarGalactica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattlestarGalactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> have mentioned previous wars with Cylons.
<ul><li> The new BSG's First Cylon War did eventually get screentime in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalacticaBloodAndChrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalacticaBloodAndChrome">Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome</a></em>. A licensed video game also purports to cover that period, even being played from the perspective of Commander Adama as a rookie pilot, but it mixes and matches so many elements of the original series and remake that it probably belongs in its own separate continuity.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episodes of the classic series referred to several different events, including the survivors of the destruction of Phaester Osiris defeating Sutekh and sealing him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars">pyramid on Mars</a>, or the ancient war between the Time Lords and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E4StateOfDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E4StateOfDecay">Great Vampires</a> shortly after the beginning of time.
</li><li> The great Cyber-Wars fought between human forces and the Cybermen were mentioned frequently, but the Cybermen were hardly even seen at the height of their power  mostly after the fact as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>.
</li><li> The Sontarans have been at war with the Rutan host for at least 60,000 years of the Whoniverse's timeline (mentioned in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>), and yet we've never encountered a Rutan and Sontaran together on TV once.
</li><li> The Last Great Time War, between the classic and new series. It was never shown, we know only that it caused a lot of destruction and wiped out entire races, including the Time Lords, whose last survivor was the Doctor. We find out that the Doctor was the one who ended the war, killing <em>every</em> Dalek (apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">a few who got away, of course</a>) at the cost of also killing <em>every</em> Time Lord, including their own children and grandchildren. The Doctor has to deal with the consequences of the Time War from time to time and sometimes they or somebody else makes a reference to some events of it, but it's still mostly a mystery.
<ul><li> The Time War is described by the Gelth in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E3TheUnquietDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E3TheUnquietDead">"The Unquiet Dead"</a> as being "invisible to lesser species but devastating to higher ones", meaning that the Time War was "offscreen", as it were, to a large portion of the Universe.
</li><li> Showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> has gone on record saying that he will never show the Time War since there isn't enough money in the world to do it justice.

Not many details are revealed, but no nukes were used, which is amazing, since both China and India have them. The first protagonist fought there, and the second one took on the identity of someone else who did. Apparently, the war ended when someone employed a new WMD called the Quantum Vortex (some suggest it was the Taelons), which killed 100,000 people. There's also the Taelon-Jaridian War, of which barely anything is known.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> had a great battle between Good and Evil 10,000 years ago. Zordon was with the good guys, Rita with the bad guys under the command of Zedd. The only other clue we have about it is the ending: According to some of the novelizations released around the time, the war ended in "a tie" and came down to a frikkin' <em>coin toss</em> to end the war. Zordon won, but Rita, being a sore loser, trapped Zordon in his Time Warp and stole the Dragon Coin before she and her minions were sealed away in the trashcan. Naturally, nothing like the books' 'coin toss' thing has ever been suggested onscreen. All we know is, Rita got canned, and that Zordon has used teenagers before (though none of Zordon's warriors in flashbacks looked like Rangers.)

</li><li> The war between Earth and Romulan Star Empire, which forms the backstory for the episode "Balance of Terror".

</li><li> The "brutal border wars" against the Talarians and the Tzenkethi, which happened at some point between the <em>Original Series</em> and <em>The Next Generation</em>. There was also at least one conflict with the Tholians in the same time-frame.

The war itself was represented as a stand-alone board game only. It produced some interesting novels set in the aftermath of the War where characters often have to deal with the consequences, but the canon version of the war itself is relatively obscure.

All of these are provided some level of detail (specifically who was fighting and why), but the exact events of the wars are generally shrouded in mystery (typically because they all involved reality being damaged to some degree).
<ul><li> And those are just wars involving the Exalted. The occasional hint is dropped regarding wars waged by gods in the era before humanity, and even occasionally to conflicts involving the Primordials prior to the existence of Creation.
</li><li> Autochthonia has its own version in the Elemental War (so named because it so devastated the mechanical ecology that it drove thousands of elementals violently mad), which was noteworthy for being an extremely violent, ethnically driven total war in a world where most fighting is skirmishes to steal resources and supply lines.

Caledor sent the emissaries back with nothing, saying that the Dwarfs had to beg if they wanted anything. Gotrek was pissed, but sent the emissaries back another time, demanding more compensation for the insult. Caledor had their beards shaved, one of the most grievous insults to a Dwarf, starting a war that would wreck both kingdoms and leave the two races as bitter enemies.

Going further back, the War In Heaven between the Slaan and the Necrons sets up the backstory for the setting as a whole, but few details are ever given and even less is known in-universe. Some of these have been elaborated on more over time, especially the Horus Heresy which started as a vague explanation for why Chaos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> exist and why the Emperor doesn't do much, but in recent years has become a major focus of the literature in the expanded universe.
<ul><li> There are also numerous examples of wars which would count as great in most settings, but which are so small they hardly get a mention in Warhammer. Crusades lasting decades and covering hundreds or thousands of worlds often get little more than a sentence or two of offhand mention. Even those that form the background of larger works (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em>) have very little of the whole war ever shown.

As the game has expanded forward in time, sourcebooks have also been released to allow games being played at these time points, using era-appropriate tech and 'mechs.

<ul><li> The War of the First Council in the First Era set the stage for all that followed. The devout, Daedra/ancestor-worshipping Chimer and atheistic, scientific Dwemer came into conflict in the land now known as Morrowind. After years of fighting, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">forced to team up</a> to drive out the invading Nords. Their alliance remained under the leadership of Chimeri Lord Indoril Nerevar and Dwemer Dumac Dwarfking, known as the "first council." It was a time of great peace and prosperity for both races. However, the Dwemer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">Dug Too Deep</a> beneath Red Mountain and unearthed the Heart of Lorkhan, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">creator god</a>. Chief Tonal Architect, Lord Kagrenec, crafted tools to tap into the power of the heart, hoping to allow the Dwemer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOFExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOFExistence">transcend mortality</a>. The Chimer, seeing this as a blasphemy against their gods in the Daedra, attempted to stop the Dwemer, reigniting their war. Forces led by Nerevar and Lord Voryn Dagoth infiltrated the Dwemer Red Mountain stronghold. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">Exactly what happened next is up for intense debate</a>, but the Dwemer disappeared from existence, Nerevar was slain, Dagoth and the Tribunal used the tools on the heart to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">achieve godhood</a>, and Azura cursed the Chimer with dark skin and red eyes, transforming them into the modern Dunmer. The Nord defeat in Morrowind also marked the furthest expanse of their early empire, the first empire of Men in Tamriel. Many of their conquests were thanks to their mastery of the Thu'um as a weapon of war. After that defeat, Jurgen Windcaller, one of the defeated Nord leaders, reflected on it and determined that it was a punishment from the gods for misusing the Thu'um. Thus, he created the Way of the Voice and founded the Greybeards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">only use the Thu'um to honor the gods</a>. Afterward, it saw a drastic drop in use as a weapon of war and the Nords were never again able to reach that level as an empire. The aftereffects of this battle can still be felt in the plotlines for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>.

Septim had conquered all but Morrowind (protected by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> and the Summerset Isles (protected by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">powerful magics</a>) during the late 2nd Era, the only two provinces the last empire out of Cyrodiil, the Reman Dynasty, had failed to conquer.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ek29');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ek29" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ek29');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Reman I was able to get the Altmer to join his Empire, but not by military force. He got them to join via treaty with exceptionally favorable terms to the Altmer.</span> Unknown to Septim, the Dunmer demi-gods of Morrowind, known as the Tribunal, had been cut off from their divine power source by their ancient enemy, Dagoth Ur. Septim's legions easily sacked Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind. Without their gods to protect them, the rest of Morrowind would have been devastated in a protracted war with Septim's legions. Knowing this, Vivec, one of these gods, met with Septim and forged an Armistice. Morrowind would join the empire as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal">Voluntary Vassal</a>, sparing his people from war.

(Specifially, continued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great House</a> rule, free worship of the Tribunal, and the right to continue practicing slavery which was outlawed elsewhere in the empire.)

With the unification of Tamriel, Septim began the Third Era of Tamriellic history during which the games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">Arena</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> all take place.

Both kings were slain during the war, which saw Lysandus' son lead the forces of Daggerfall to victory. Lysandus' ghost, however, returned to haunt the city of Daggerfall, which kicks off the plot to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em>.

The Dominion's forces sacked the Imperial City, committing gruesome atrocities against the city's populace. With reinforcements from his Nord forces in Skyrim, Mede was able to recapture the city, but at great cost. Knowing that his empire was too exhausted to endure further conflict, Mede reluctantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonTheWarLostThePeace">signed the White-Gold Concordat</a>; a treaty that, among other things, banned the worship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Talos</a> in the Empire.

<ul><li> Additional media expands upon the circumstances of the War: It wasn't so much that the Combine overpowered the <em>full might</em> of the world's militaries in a matter of seven hours, but that, ever since the Black Mesa Incident, the planet had been devastated by portal storms and the hostile extraterrestrial life that emerged from them. It was to the point that the planet was practically three steps away from total societal breakdown anyways, and the Combine <em>just happened to come across Earth</em> in the midst of all this. The Seven Hour War wasn't so much of a "decisive battle" as it was simply mopping up what little military resistance could be mustered in the middle of the massive global calamity. The true tragedy of the Seven Hour War isn't that Humanity's forces weren't defeated so decisively and trivially, but that Humanity <em>lost the War before it even began.</em>

No one knows who launched first, and given the state of the world afterwards it doesn't really matter anymore.
<ul><li> Two sources - the leader of the Enclave (the remnants of the US government) and the log of a Chinese submarine commander during the Great War - point to the Chinese. Still, they might be mistaken, and part of the lead-up to the Great War is still undetailed - the war between China and the USA has been given a fair bit of attention, but the other Resource Wars - especially the one between Europe and the Middle East, and the ones that happened in Europe after that - are still mostly names, if even that.
<ul><li> Also the theory that a bored AI started it.

Vague references to the war between the Qunari and the Tevinter Imperium are also present.
<ul><li> The First Blight lasted 192 years, the Second lasted 90 years: the Third and Fourth blight were comparatively smaller and lasted only 15 and 12 years. At the beginning of <em>Origins</em>, Duncan is desperately trying to increase the ranks of the Fereldan Grey Wardens in order to avoid another Blight lasting years or even generations. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> confirms that the Fifth Blight, which is the setting of <em>Origins</em>, lasted a full year, which is comparatively amazing.</span>
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> is about what <em>started</em> the Mage-Templar War that has engulfed all of Thedas by 9:40 Dragon. Vague hints are all we actually know about the present in which the framing-device is set, whereas the game itself focuses on the life of Hawke from 9:30 - 9:37 Dragon and how the Champion came to unintentionally participate in the opening shots of the conflict.
</li><li> Thedas history is built on one enormous war after another. The titular Dragon Age was predicted to be a time of upheaval, but it's still got some catching up to do in terms of body count. The oldest known conflict, predating the First Blight and the Age system, is the elf empire vs the nascent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">Tevinter Imperium</a>.

It can escalate into a full-scale war, but hints in later games implies that the path in which that occurs isn't the one that happened).
</li><li> The rebellions against the Colonial Government after the Silence (the loss of contact with the Ancients, the mother civilization). The Colonial Government ruling the planet had been strong before the Silence, but after their legitimacy was damaged and their resources strained, and with that came rebellions. Initially the Colonial Government,under Governor Padish, held on by pumping out weapons and armour using the miraculous Heavenly Forges, but without Ancient maintenance the Forges gradually began to break down, and the rebellions chipped away at the Government. Within a century it had collapsed... and that is what is known of the only known <em>planet-spanning</em> conflict in the history of Enroth.

<div class="indent"><strong>Nightwing</strong>: Gig maybe? since in one of raritys asks he did throw a paint bomb into her boutique. <br/><strong>Rainbow Dash</strong>: That was when I lost my temper and fought with him.

Gig did not stay petrified, though, and he beat me to a pulp again, If it werent for Zecora my wings would have had to be amputated. I still had to go to the hospital again. <br/>Then the princesses called the emergency meeting to learn as much as possible about Gig. The six of us were there, as were primate experts Lyra Heartstrings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls">Sunset Shimmer</a>.

There we learned about Gigs former good self as Vigilance, and Twilight decided to use the memory spell to awaken his Vigilance memories. <br/>Pinkie found some hotpods, somehow. Just by being Pinkie Pie, I guess. Anyway, Gig came for them and Twilight cast the memory spell. Sadly, the Vigilance memories didnt stick.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> takes place a thousand years after "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingMakesAMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingMakesAMushroom">Mushroom</a> War", which pretty much destroyed all of humanity. The events aren't elaborated on for the first third of the series' run. It isn't until the episodes "Finn the Human" and "Jake the Dog" that we explicitly learn it was a nuclear conflict, and one of the bombs unleashed massive mutagenic (and magical) energies, and these energies either gave birth to the Lich or revived him in the then-modern world. A solid third of the planet was also blown up, with observers from space being able to see a giant gap that goes all the way down to the core.
<ul><li> Also mentioned at one point is a war between rainicorns and dogs, which is never elaborated upon (beyond mention of Lady Rainicorn's father being saved by a dog at some point during it) but shown as a cause for great strife between the species.
</li></ul></li><li> Not <em>exactly</em> a war, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> has the Fire Nation's destruction of the Air Nomads 100 years prior to the start of the series.
<ul><li> The Hundred-Year War itself is an an interesting variation in the show, as while it is ongoing, it still fits within the realms of this trope: we see much of the actual effects of the war, with the show taking place during its final year, but we get little information concerning the period between the Fire Nation beginning their expansion and colonization of other countries at the start of the war to the present. We only see some snippets of the raids on the Southern Water Tribe and Iroh's assault on Ba Sing Se through flashbacks while most other battles are only alluded to. Even over the course of the show itself we don 't der that much of the actual war, with only a small handful of major military battles being shown. (four, <em>maybe</em> five if you count "The Drill"). In fact, the entire century of conflict between Aang's freezing to when Katara frees him is mostly untouched, even in fan fiction.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> referred occasionally to "The Near-Apocalypse of '09", wherein the Justice League managed to seemingly kill the notoriously unkillable Ra's Al Ghul for good. Its nature has been speculated on for years by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a> fans; one guess is that it was the final battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>, which was definitely a "near-apocalypse", but the instigator of that conflict was Darkseid, not Al Ghul.

It is particularly oft mentioned in the early episodes, before the <em>Second</em> Neosapien War breaks out and easily surpasses the original one in scope and impact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> occasionally makes reference to some war or another, usually for a quick gag. One time one is relevant to the main plot is in "Three Hundred Big Boys", where the spoils from a recently-won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Bug War</a> are spread among the populace. There were also the <em>Star Trek</em> Wars (not to be confused with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Star Wars Trek</a>"), which resulted in the banning of <em>Star Trek</em>, which led into the events of "Where No Fan Has Gone Before".

This is a major background event, particularly as the hero, Darrel's, father was one of the Kulipari who died in that final battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace">Lloyd in Space</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> given that the show's description and marketing mentioned that it takes place shortly after World war IX, only for said war to <em>never</em> get mentioned in the show proper or have any implications on the world. It was likely either a dropped plot or an excuse as to why the show constantly deals with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> between the alien races.

By the time the series starts, the war is over, with the Autobots having won and the Decepticons scattered to the far reaches of space.

We later see some flashbacks from Ratchet's perspective.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>, it contains references to the Third and Fourth Great (or "Cybertronian") Wars, the assumption being that there were a first and second. (They're probably in the fourth one. Or the fifth, if you consider the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em> to be the end of that particular war.)
</li><li> And speaking of <em>Transformers: The Movie</em>, the movie was never seen in Japan until four years after its American release, and even then Japanese fans have already seen Season 3 (there called <em>Transformers 2010</em>). As such, events from the movie were referred to but <em>never</em> seen. So this would count, as it had gained a mysterious and legendary quality beforehand. Japanese first coined the term the "Unicron War".
</li><li> In the Generation 1 episode "Sea Change", Perceptor mentions a "Third Cybertron War". Apparently separate from the Third Cybertron<strong>ian</strong> War. Though given the context, it's not clear.
</li><li> At some point in the process of writing some of the more recent spin-off comics, the writers appear to have decided that all the above were effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">one single conflict</a> with occasional lulls or ceasefires, thus handily allowing any confusion over which war a particular character happened to be referencing at the time to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">the Cybertronians having trouble keeping track as well</a>: If the only actual <em>peace</em> was the occasional short interlude where everyone was busy rearming they'd have to start blurring together after a while.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> makes occasional references to the "Pyramid Wars" of 1987, in which the O.S.I. finally defeated S.P.H.I.N.X. (largely parodies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a> and Cobra). While some characters are said to have fought in it, very little detail is given.
