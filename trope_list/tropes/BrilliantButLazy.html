<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko">Aggretsuko</a></em>: Director Ton is usually seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeGolf">practicing his golf swing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss">bossing around his underlings</a> (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Retsuko</a>), but during the end-of-quarter crunch in episode 10 he's shown to be a whiz at making calculations with an abacus.
</li><li> Yurine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnoKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnoKiss">Ano Kiss</a></em> is the best at everything without even trying and spends most of her time sleeping in class (including cooking class!). You could say she isn't so much lazy as completely lacking motivation, both because she never has to work hard and because she considers herself a nuisance for other people. She <em>can</em> get serious when she has an actual reason to — said reason is most often her competition with the girl she loves, Ayaka.
</li><li> Karma Akabane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> is solidly in this trope, getting 4th place in the school on midterms when the odds were stacked against his class due to additional last minute questions they hadn't been told to study for out of sheer smarts...and also being a lazy jokester. He's in class 3-E for his bully hunting and delinquent ways, not his grades. However, the trope is deconstructed with the term finals, where Karma doesn't study at all and drops to 13th place. True, 13th in the entire school without studying when the exams are designed to be insanely difficult is no mean feat, but the pain comes from Karma knowing (and knowing everyone else also knows) that <em>he can do better</em>. In the final test of the series, he gets a perfect score, having studied in order to beat his rival who is both brilliant and a hard worker.
</li><li> Tomo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> shows signs of intelligence, but clearly doesn't put it to any use, academic or mundane. The only sign of her intelligence is the high marks she gets when she actually does study. Her 100% on the health test (beating out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> Chiyo) highlights this best, but another example is her getting into the same school Yomi did.
</li><li> Hiramaru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em> — self-taught manga artist and writer who took one glimpse at a recent issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em>, learned a few tricks, and produced manga so good it got serialized on the first try. However, he decided to make manga because he thought that's an easy job and once he finds out it's not a cakewalk, he does everything he can to avoid working.
</li><li> Roger Smith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> is 'bout half an example. When he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">a job</a>, he'll go at it with the tenacity of a badger, and won't rest till it's done. If he DOESN'T have a mission scheduled, however, he's quite content to stay in bed all day—most of the time, it seems that the only reason he gets up at ALL is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">R. Dorothy Waynewright</a>'s nerve-wracking piano-playing. In an early episode, he goes through a major mission (including obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> battle) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker">just to get her some piano-lessons</a> so she'll at least wake him up <em>gently</em>. (It works, but even afterwards she still resorts to her old rapid-fire "Alarm Clock" playing whenever Roger stays in bed 'till late afternoon.)
</li><li> Raia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> is characterized largely by his lack of desire to do anything until coerced to do so. However, he is also a master of Copy Magic, a set of spells that allow him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">access to every spell of any spellbook he has come into physical contact with</a>, and is not only able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">gain instant proficiency with them all</a>, he was born with enormous mana reserves allowing him to use those spells with equal or greater power and potency than their original users. He can even create a duplicate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero">Asta's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> swords, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though he could not copy their Anti-Magic traits</span>. It is only logical that his total lack of initiative is paired up with an innate skill in magic that allows him to use spells without having to learn or practice them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kyouraku prefers to get drunk and veg out under the sun to fighting, despite being one of the strongest captains in the Soul Society. When ordered to stop the intruders, he tries to avoid fighting by asking Chad to drink with him instead. When he fights the most powerful Espada, Starrk realizes they share this personality, and, believing Kyouraku hates fighting as much as him, suggests they engage in a pretend fight until the war is over. He discovers too late that he is wrong; Kyouraku may be "brilliant but lazy", but he's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a> specialist who believes in getting a fight finished as fast as possible by misdirection and pragmatism. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There's a good reason, why <em>he</em>, instead of Byakuya or Unohana, becomes the Captain-Commander, after Soul Society gets its worst defeat in a thousand years.</span>
</li><li> Rangiku is one of the most talented and well-respected lieutenants in the Gotei 13. She's been around for a very long time (longer than Squad 10's current captain, Toshiro, even), has extensive academic knowledge of fighting and kidou, and always has her captain's back in battle. However, she has turned avoiding work into an art form, has mastered surreptitiously pushing her duties onto other people, is an expert at disappearing when admin is required and loves partying and drinking.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Yukimura</a> gets the Braves to do all the heavy lifting for him in private and public matters, and would sooner pretend to be sick in bed rather than greet his own brother, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">brilliance</a> is unquestionable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lelouch Lamperouge of cultivates a public image of this as an alternative to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a>; however, it's true in regards to "everyday life" (i.e., everything not relating to fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>), as he could easily score straight A's and move on to a successful corporate career (and maybe even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">score a few girls on the side</a>) if he wasn't so tied up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a>. He also feels that becoming successful in Brittanian society would be a form of giving in to his father: he wants no part of the world Brittania has to offer.
</li><li> Rakshata Chawla is another example. She's a brilliant scientist and the self-proclaimed "Mother" of Kallen's Gurren mecha, but she prefers to spend most of the series lounging about on a sofa and smoking a pipe. Even when the Black Knights are in the middle of a heated battle, she'll just be laying on a sofa on the bridge of the ship, not giving a care about what will happen next.

He is also rarely seen upright without the promise of food.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> regarding some of the Saiyans.
<ul><li> Gohan has the potential to become <em>the</em> strongest fighter in the universe. However, he lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">the instinctive love of combat</a> that pure-blood Saiyans like his father and Vegeta do and has developed a tendency to not keep up with his martial arts training in times of peace so his strength and ability greatly fluctuates. On the other hand, when the people he cares about are in danger and matters are looking very serious, Gohan becomes intensely focused on training and shows off why he is his father's son. He is also more naturally driven to scholarly pursuits, earning top grades in school and ending up with a good job to support his family as an adult. It's not so much that he is <em>lazy</em>, more that he tends to put effort into his other interests if he is able to.
</li><li> Goku has spent his life training with many people to become stronger and shows a love of doing so coinciding with his Saiyan blood and his own personality. However, because training, fighting, and eating are his main interests, it's hard to get him to do anything else. This is a point of constant tension between Chi-Chi and him since she wants him to get a job. She eventually gets her way, making Goku get a job as a farmer, which in a roundabout way suits him due to its potential to be physically laborious.
</li><li> Much like Goku, if it doesn't relate to becoming stronger, Vegeta has no interest in it. This is lampshaded by Bulma when she asks how Saiyans can spend days training, yet refuse to do something simple like cut the grass.
</li><li> Goten and Trunks are straighter examples. They have the talent to far surpass their fathers, but like Gohan, lack the instinctive love of combat so while they train, they are often distracted in doing other things like playing around as kids.
</li><li> Goku's older brother Raditz is made this retroactively. While in the anime itself he is little more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a>, the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallHeroes">Dragon Ball Heroes</a></em> reveals that Raditz shares his brother's ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">learn any attack after seeing it performed</a>, a very rare gift in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> world that would have made Raditz by far a more versatile fighter than any of his Saiyan cohorts if he'd ever utilized it properly. But unlike virtually every other pure-blooded Saiyan in the series, he is shown to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">prize survival above a good fight</a>, and so never advanced beyond the strength and skill of a rank-and-file Frieza grunt.
</li></ul></li><li> Frieza was born naturally strong. Without ever trying, he was the strongest being in the universe before Super Saiyan Goku came along. In <em>Resurrection 'F</em>' he finally decides to subvert this after coming back to life, realizing that if a Saiyan could go and exceed him and monsters like Majin Buu, what would training do for someone like him? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He still falls into this, however, since he doesn't bother to master his Golden transformation before going to Earth and never fully learns from his mistakes on Namek.</span> As another testament to his laziness, during the Namek Saga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">literally his</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">entire army</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">has to die</a> before he can be bothered to so much as track down the Z-Fighters himself, let alone challenge them — he assumes Dodoria and Zarbon would deal with his Vegeta problem, and when that doesn't happen, he calls in the Ginyu Force, only to find out later while he is off on an errand (to figure out how to activate the Dragon Balls) that <em>they all got killed as well</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By his return in the Universe Survival arc in <em>Super</em> he <em>finally</em> subverted it by fully mastering the power of his Golden form through meditating in Hell...which started by his daydreams of murdering Goku. It's telling it took <em>dying twice</em> before he finally fully appreciated the value of hard work.</span>
</li><li> Yajirobe is legitimately one of the most powerful human fighters on Earth, and could probably give Krillin a run for his money if he applied himself, but nine times out of ten, he just doesn't care. Tellingly, the last time we see him training in earnest is to prepare for the arrival of the Saiyans, but he gives up about halfway through and just snacks the whole time. Not even the threat of global annihilation is enough motivation for Yajirobe to get off his ass and do something.
</li><li> There's also Lord Beerus, Universe 7's God of Destruction, along with his brother Champa, the God of Destruction of Universe 6. Both are their universe's second strongest fighters behind their angels who have the power to obliterate planets with just a wave of their hands. That is, if they can get off their asses to do so. Champa is glutinous and Beerus takes decades-long naps. Heck, Universe 7's low power level is <em>because</em> of Beerus' laziness as he allowed Majin Buu and Frieza's rampages to happen.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Greg "Bear" Egan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> is something on an example... it's just that his lethargy and intelligence don't really interact very much. His reclusive nature and slow speed of movement are mainly due to his colossal size and enormous weight problem.
</li><li> Agon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>. Said to be the quarterback that comes only once every 100 years, and he never shows up to practice. He spends every day womanizing, beating up people, ditching those women, and the few times he practices, he doesn't even put on his uniform. And he's still awesome at football. A rare villainous example of this trope; part of the reason Agon is so odious is that he was born with incredible talent and can dominate almost anyone without putting forth any effort. He is fully aware of this and even laughs about it, mocking those who try hard. In a series that's all about improving oneself through hard work and effort, that puts him in direct philosophical opposition to basically every other character. Emphasized by Agon's brother, who has had to work hard his entire life to be half as good as Agon is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>: Lucy notes this trope early on in the manga, stating that if she trained her celestial spirits (which are already fairly powerful), they could potentially be more powerful than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Natsu</a>. However, her initial cowardly nature forces her to take a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> approach to fighting.
</li><li> Appropriately enough, Sloth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. He's easily one of the most powerful <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the fastest</span> homunculi, he just can't be bothered to do anything unless Father forces him to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apparently, even <em>living</em> takes too much effort for him, as he realizes in his dying moments.</span>
</li><li> Kyon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> (at least in the novels) is shown to be quite intelligent and observant and doesn't mind rubbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">references to advanced physics, ancient mythology, history and psychology in your face</a>. He is also a highly apathetic and cynical guy who barely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">does above average in school</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Or so he says. The occasional line from other characters implies he is of much higher academic status than he claims. Like top of the class</a>. Also, Koizumi teaches him how to play Go during one of their usual club meetings where they do absolutely nothing. After a few games, Kyon is easily beating Koizumi. It is also implied that Koizumi just really sucks at board games so Kyon beating him might not be a sign of vast intellect.
</li><li> Miyako of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em> is a non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> example. Every time we saw her in classes that are not studio arts, she always dozes off — yet her junior high grades were so great that she had the academic portion of her high school admission exam exempted.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoushinEngi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoushinEngi">Houshin Engi</a></em>: Taijuu Rokkun put this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and beyond. He is one of the most powerful immortals in the series, likely second only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Shinkouhyou</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the first peoples like Jyoka and Fukki</span>, but he is so lazy that he can spend two years sleeping continuously, and live in a special suit with an artificial respirator so that he doesn't have to bother breathing.
</li><li> Oreki Houtarou in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka">Hyouka</a></em> has proven to be remarkably intelligent and gifted with quick deductions, and (as theorized by his best friend Satoshi) would have been one of the most popular and academically outstanding men in his school if he weren't so lazy.
<div class="indent"><strong>Oreki:</strong> If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to, I'll do it quick.

<ul><li> Neptune from can be a very competent politician when she's not playing video games or trying to push her work onto Histoire.

</li><li> Saruhiko Fushimi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>. He has been mentioned to be extremely talented, except that he slacks off more often than not. He became third-in-command of Scepter 4 by the age of 19.
</li><li> Hirasawa Yui from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> mostly obeys this trope. One time she is so busy practicing her guitar that she doesn't study for an exam and fails it which requires her to take a makeup exam. Yui's fellow band members (mostly Mio) help her study for the makeup exam, and she ends up getting 100% - better than any of them. On the other hand, it seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining">to learn one thing she has to forget something else</a>.

Kaguya theorizes that this atitude is a result of him having been suspended for several months during his final year of middle school. This is also implied to be the reason why Iino doesn't get along with him, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she fought for him to be allowed to graduate back in middle school on the grounds that he handed in all his homework on time during said months long suspension. Seeing him squander his potential makes her feel like all her efforts were wasted</span>.
</li><li> The titular character of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em> series. At the start of the series he's a deadbeat who has spends all his time gambling, but when he's thrown into some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">Absurdly High-Stakes Game</a> at the hands of the Teai group to pay off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts">debt</a>, he's capable of pulling off some amazing strategies and gambits in order to survive. However, once the pressure is off he'll often fall back into his usual lazy habits.
</li><li> Akitsune of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KataribeNoList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KataribeNoList">Kataribe No List</a></em> can appraise any antique on sight, quickly comes up with ways to use or counter the Grimm artifacts, and barely keeps up in school despite constantly showing up late or sleeping through class. But he'd rather just skip school entirely.
</li><li> Belphegor of the villainous Varia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>. Unsurprising, considering he's the sloth of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> theme they have going.
</li><li> Pascal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta">Kaze to Ki no Uta</a></em> is this. He's a very smart student in his school and he is capable of doing well in classes, but he has failed in classes three years in a row because he prefers to study in more useful/interesting things, like knitting.
</li><li> Ran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KazemakaseTsukikageRan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KazemakaseTsukikageRan">Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran</a></em> is an extremely talented sword fighter, but prefers to spend her time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">looking for sake</a> and lying around in sunny fields. Don't you <em>dare</em> do anything to Meow, though. Or deprive her of her much-beloved sake.
</li><li> Eriko Futami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kimikiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kimikiss">Kimikiss</a></em> skips nearly all her classes but places at the top of every examination consistently.
</li><li> Hajime Kindaichi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em> is this in the academic sense. Still, it's pointed out to him that the most shining example of his intelligence (solving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery">locked room murders</a>) isn't exactly the kind of thing that'll get him into a good school. He's basically lazy about everything EXCEPT a good murder mystery. When one of those comes along, he's incredibly dedicated.
</li><li> Fujitaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KitchenPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KitchenPrincess">Kitchen Princess</a></em> acts like a bum most of the time, but he used to work at a three-star restaurant and occasionally busts out his cooking skills.
</li><li> Aomine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em> is this to the core. He prefers to sleep on the rooftop rather than go to basketball practice and often shows up for matches at the halfway mark...if he bothers to show up at all. However, he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruct</a> this—he was originally passionate about basketball and worked hard at it because he loved it. But as he got better and better, his opponents starting giving up more and more easily. Eventually, he gave up on being serious about basketball, because there was no one who could equal him at it.
<ul><li> Aomine isn't the only one. Back in the day, after the other four members of the Generation of Miracles developed their talents, Akashi gave them the permission to skip training like Aomine and do what they want as long as they play the matches. The only one who continued to train was Midorima. After entering high school, Kise declared that he would skip training when he joined the basketball club, but Kasamatsu forced him to stay and keep training like everyone else regardless of how talented he is. And in the case of Murasakibara, while he's still extremely lazy, he doesn't skip training because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he lost a one-on-one to Akashi and is made to accept that Akashi is stronger than him. Murasakibara only listens to people who are better than he is at basketball.</span>
</li><li> Murasakibara is also this trope. He's very good at basketball because of his size, but he doesn't actually care about it all that much (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">supposedly</a>) so he never usually puts any effort in. He's shown to go all out only three times in the entire series: in the Teikou arc when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akashi beats him in the aforementioned one-on-one</span>, the Seirin vs. Yousen match and the Vorpal Swords vs. Jabberwock match in the sequel Extra Game/Last Game (where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ended up breaking his arm</span>). He's also the only one of the Generation of Miracles not affected by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> at the hands of Seirin, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">motivated</a> the others to actually enjoy basketball again (yes, even Aomine)</span>, and still complains about having to hang out with everybody. He'd much rather be lying in bed eating snacks than be on the court. To top it all off, one of his character songs is even called "Lazy Lazy".

</li><li> When Nozaki's little brother Mayu was young he was bullied for being quiet, Nozaki told him to do his best, but if it was too much work he didn't have to bother. Taking that to heart, Mayu uses the least possible effort for anything in his daily life apart from his love for judo. When his club members used judo as bait, he instantly got top grades and became very popular, which irritated them enough to stop the plan.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shikamaru Nara may be one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">smartest ninja</a> in the entire world with an IQ over 200, but he has the energy levels of an 80-year-old man in the body of a teenager and would rather sit back and grumble while playing board games than do any actual work. In the beginning, he was so lazy that he was willing to fail school instead of studying. (It's explained he had the second lowest grades in the academy, and counting Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a>, the <em>lowest</em>.) Even lifting the pencil to take a test was a chore for him. Despite this, he was so smart he passed anyway. He may have also forced himself to work just enough to pass without having the absolute worst grade in the class. His mom would hassle him endlessly if he flunked, and that's even more work to deal with. In <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>, after some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> triggered by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asuma's death</span>, he becomes more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Badass Bookworm</a>, regarded as one of the best candidates for Hokage. Because of this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he singlehandedly takes down Hidan, a member of Akatsuki, to the point where it constitutes a Curbstomp. Not only does he kill the immortal by blowing up everything but his head and burying it, still living, in a pretty deep hole, BUT he tricks the guy into killing his own teammate first</span>. Shikamaru was also the <em>only</em> participant in the Chunin Exams that actually got promoted, despite forfeiting his match against Temari (having determined that there was no way he could win). The rest of the Konoha 11 (except for Naruto and Sasuke) eventually caught up to him, with Neji overtaking him, due to his laziness and lack of ambition. Even <em>then</em>, he still can command even Jonin, the level above him, on missions. Later in that same arc, the Sound ninja used a genjutsu to put everyone in the arena to sleep. Only some of the elite Leaf ninja figured out what was happening and dispelled the technique on themselves. Shikamaru was among those few but still pretended to be sleeping so he wouldn't have to join the battle. This is developed further on and he does mention that he will help Naruto with his dream of being Hokage. This after seeing an interaction with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the resurrected goofy First Hokage and his serious younger brother, the Second Hokage</span> interact and coming to the conclusion Naruto needs someone to be able to advise him on matters.

He also happens to be one of the Three Admirals, the Marines' most powerful commanders, who in his first appearance brutally curbstomps half of the Straw Hats with almost zero effort (he takes out Robin and Luffy in a single attack). That's not even getting into the sheer carnage he causes at Marineford... However, the most telling case occurs during the timeskip. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sengoku retires after the stress of the job of Fleet Admiral gets to him, especially after the Five Elder Stars cover up the escape of extremely dangerous criminals.

So serious in fact he challenges Akainu to a duel for the job, the loser giving up the spot. This duel between the two Admials goes on for <em>ten days</em> and permanently creates severe weather on the island they are on (massive blizzards on one side and a hot volcanic hell on the other). Despite having the elemental advantage, Akainu barely won and Aokiji quit rather than work for Akainu.</span>
</li><li> Gecko Moriah, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, has a very powerful Devil Fruit ability that lets him manipulate his shadow for a variety of purposes, steal people's shadows and implant them into corpses, creating zombies. However, he's lazy as hell, which makes him much weaker than he should be. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, he got so weak, he actually lost his position as a Warlord.</span> He wasn't this originally; he actually was a very proactive fighter in his youth, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brutal loss against Kaidou, resulting in the death of his crew <em>broke</em> him and messed him up badly</span>.

The biggest example of this is the fact that Ranma isn't worried about Principal Kunō showing Ranma's grades to everyone which implies that either Ranma does not generally get bad grades or he really doesn't care about them (a view point that is countered by Ranma's actions when Principal Kunō implied they are extremely low).

</li><li> A better example may be her brother Shingo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, who effortlessly gets good grades, is a whiz at most video games, and is a tinkerer <em>par excellence</em> (he once rigs the bathroom scale to break hilariously once Usagi steps on it) but spends a lot of his free time messing around and picking on his sister.

At one point in time, he claims he shouldn't waste his energy fighting the underlings. He also later takes a period of time to join into a fight when he is troubled by his own personal, and considered somewhat pathetic, problems.

</li><li> Skalman the turtle from Swedish comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bamse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bamse">Bamse</a></em> is this to a very literal degree. He's a brilliant inventor and tinkerer with numerous gizmos and gadgets under his belt, however, he outright refuses to move at a pace faster than a sluggish walk (with a couple of VERY rare exceptions where his friends' lives were in danger). He also has a great disgust for people telling him to hurry, even declaring the word "hurry" itself to be the most offensive term he can think of. To bypass these issues he invented a wheelbarrow on legs that he rides in whenever he needs to move fast or go far. His biggest instance of sloth, however, is his crippling adherence to routines. He always carries around an alarm clock that rings to signal nap- or food time and will unquestionably obey it whenever it goes off, immediately dropping whatever he's doing to sleep or eat. There have been instances where he's ignored the clock, but they are vanishingly few and often involve his friends being in mortal danger.

Lou's problem is, while he's smart enough to cure cancer if he had the motivation or the inspiration, he has neither; he uses his incredible gifts to lounge around the house, avoid the other superheroes in the area who aren't cute girls, watch cheesy movies, and modify his satellite so he can pick up all the channels he wants. In fact, when the two aliens show up at his house, what he's most upset about is that they ate the last of his macaroni and cheese.

As one might expect, filmmaking and slave trading are the two biggest industries in their dimension, and Mojo became their ruler not only by dominating both industries but combining them, having slaves genetically grown for the express function of acting. (Unfortunately for him, this led to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Longshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Longshot">Longshot</a>, who would eventually lead a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">slave rebellion</a>, which turned out to be no accident; the inventor of the technology had secretly planted a seed that would grow into a desire for freedom into their genetic make-up.)

Despite his natural talent, he would rather sit down and play video games.

This is because he is incredibly busy as Robin, and it doesn't help that he doesn't care for school and ends up dropping out rather than get his high school diploma.
</li><li> Examples from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a>:
<ul><li> Between his luck and other skills, Gladstone Gander has more than enough talent to become even richer than Scrooge in a very short time... Except he prefers to coast through his life, and rarely puts the effort in anything unrelated to his rivalry with Donald.
</li><li> Donald is often seen like this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>: it's often made very clear he could become rich through his own hard work, but prefers lazying around or, when he finds a job and excels, tends to forget the little details and ruins himself. Then there are the Paperinik stories, where his laziness and lack of attention to details are simply the result of him going out almost every night and work as a superhero, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoubleDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoubleDuck">Double Duck</a></em>, where he adds being a <em>super spy</em> to the things that tire him out too much for a normal job...
</li><li> Brigitta McBridge is another businesswoman with the potential to match Scrooge (and she has occasionally <em>come out on top</em>, something <em>Flintheart Glomgold</em> can't honestly say).

<ul><li> Best shown by a parallel universe where she had succeeded in marrying her Scrooge...

Then her husband managed to switch places with the Scrooge of the main universe, and when Scrooge decided to restore his counterpart's financial empire to its former glory and put her back to work she <em>single-handedly restored the entire restaurant business branch <strong>in a month</strong></em>.

<ul><li> Wally may not actually be brilliant, but he's at least a case of <em>Competent</em>, but Lazy. He could achieve a lot more if his immediate superior was someone other than the one and only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a>. The original Wally, in his very first appearance, is brilliant but trying to get fired to get a company severance package. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottAdams">Scott Adams</a> has said this scenario was <em>exactly</em> based on real life . More than one time he has shown that his true ambition in life is to be <em>useless</em>, not lazy; in fact, he tends to put more effort into creative new ways of avoiding anything resembling a task than any amount that could possibly be demanded by said task. He once joined golf to learn new ways of being useless.
</li><li> And <a class="urllink" href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2016-09-20">some<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://dilbert.com/strip/1995-04-21">strips<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> show he may have the potential to be the laziest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a> in the world.
</li><li> Also in <em>Dilbert</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says the smartest person in the strip is Dilbert's garbageman. Why would the smartest person in the world <em>be</em> a garbageman? The author doesn't know, since <em>he</em> isn't the smartest person in the world.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> is incredibly lazy but quite intelligent: he is able to outwit criminals, is a skilled detective, and can build advanced technology out of simple household objects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em>, Roger the Dodger's gimmick is that he's often coming up with schemes to get out of doing work. Ironically, these schemes take much more effort than the work he's trying to get out of doing.
</li><li> ​Riley Freeman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> is an interesting example. He's pretty smart, and occasionally displays insight and vocabulary beyond what one would expect of an eight-year-old. However, the highest grade he's ever achieved in school is a C+  and even this he thought was too high. This is because Riley's goal in life is to emulate his favorite gangsta rappers. So it's more like Brilliant, but Ignorant. His brother Huey points out that one of his idols, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, was actually a decent student as a kid, much to Riley's disbelief.
</li><li> Calvin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>. He brings home Cs and Ds, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">the viewers (as well as Calvin's parents) know he's capable of much more</a>, given how much effort he puts into his plans to throw snowballs at Susie, has a <em>lot</em> of creativity that he spends building snowmen, and knows just about <em>everything</em> about dinosaurs. He thinks of things much beyond the simple first grade material, but he'd much rather hang out all day exploring the woods behind his house. In one strip, he gets a good grade on a test, but he feels that it's just not worth the effort. In another strip when he was comparing test grades with Susie, she was surprised why he was happier in getting a C than an A. He tells her that he figures that life is easier if he keeps everyone's expectations lower. Lampshaded in other strips, where his teacher says, "Calvin, if you'd put <em>half</em> the energy of your protests into your schoolwork..." The guy is a philosopher as well. He asks his father "how does men killing each other solve the world's problems?" to which his dad has no response. Also, when he sees a pile of litter in the forest he states that "the truest sign that intelligent life exists is that none of it has tried to contact us."
</li><li> Jeremy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits">Zits</a></em> can be this way. He gets a 3.7 GPA at high school (and is in AP classes) yet can't be assed to try harder. Of course, he's also incapable of doing household chores but what teenagers <em>aren't</em>? This varies depending on the storyline. In a few, he has a GPA <em>above</em> a 4.0 and works feverishly at his schoolwork, but his class is so full of highly-caffeinated (and occasionally flat-out cheating) overachievers that this barely puts him in the top half of the class.
</li><li> Caulfield in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz">Frazz</a></em> can run circles around his teachers, but he avoids serious work whenever possible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AngusOg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AngusOg">Angus Og</a></em>: Angus himself. If he put half as much energy into honest work as he did dodging it with his imaginative, and often convoluted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetRichQuickScheme">Get Rich Quick Schemes</a> he'd have been a millionaire.

</li><li> J. Wellington Wimpy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> is incredibly intelligent and well-spoken. It was once mentioned that he went to college (bear in mind this was during a time when a college education wasn't required or commonplace), but he never works, and would prefer to get through life by mooching off of others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey">Beetle Bailey</a></em>: Plato is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a> of the camp, but he's got no damn interest at all in being a good soldier, and all he ever (rarely) uses his brains for besides idle philosophising is avoiding work.

Yet she spends far more time indulging in her fascination with Japanese culture than caring about what her board members think of her and plans on attending U.A.

</li><li> Superboy/Conner Kent in <em>Teen Titans: Call of Blood</em>, who was engineered to have "the power of Superman and the mind of Lex Luthor," and there are signs he inherited the knowledge and intellect of his human "father." He can quote Machiavelli, use terms like "Sisyphean" and "quid pro quo" in the right contexts, and repair a remote data receiver without instructions. However, all Conner really wants to do is play superhero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HormoneAddledTeenager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HormoneAddledTeenager">chase skirts</a>, then kick back with video games and junk food like a normal teenager.

In truth, she actively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defies the trope,</a> as she usually multi-tasks by practicing her English while mostly immobile, and she works hard at physical conditioning when she isn't preoccupied meditating.

</li><li> Max Fischer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rushmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rushmore">Rushmore</a></em> is a variation — he's failing at school because he devotes all of his brains to extra-curricular activities and mad schemes (like getting Latin cut from the curriculum in favour of Japanese... and then saving Latin again.

But the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ghostbusters">IDW comics</a> have shown that when the chips are down, Venkman <em>does</em> have considerable skills in the areas.

He says that this is because of how he was raised, on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">his deceased father</a> causing his mother to be averse to his activities that may lead her to lose another family member (like joining the armed forces).

</li><li> Similarly in the crossover film, <em>Zatoichi meets Yojimbo</em>, Sasa is a brilliant swordsman in combat, but, as one gang leader points out, "he's either drunk or snoring away".

His world consists of his lodgings, his job at the Foreign Office, and his club (the Diogenes Club, the club for unclubbable men, which happens to be across the street from his lodgings). Sherlock explains that Mycroft refuses to do anything practical, instead preferring to act as a giant computer to crunch all the information he receives. On the other hand, Mycroft's work determines national policy, and Sherlock states that in some ways Mycroft <em>is</em> the British government. Sherlock, on the other hand, only uses his towering genius to solve private mysteries that interest him. He skips cases that bore him and sometimes prefers to just stay at home.
<ul><li> It's lampshaded and somewhat deconstructed in Mycroft's first appearance—Sherlock notes that if catching criminals only involved being an armchair detective, Mycroft would by far surpass him. However, while Mycroft can put the facts together from the paper, you need someone who can a) examine the evidence onsite and b) actually catch the criminal.

In one of the earlier books, it's stated that she gets good grades in most of her classes, despite her primary concern being boys, parties, and shopping.

Additionally, she is shown to have a natural aptitude and skill for certain things. And in the best example of this, she aces the SATs, considerably outscoring Elizabeth, despite barely studying. Unfortunately, rather than congratulating her, everyone thinks she cheated.

Moreover, in the book describing the achievements of each member of the Kingsguard, his page is ridiculously small and the only notability compared to other members is his killing of Aerys... so as a swordsman he's practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a>, but as a member of the Kingsguard he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>.

He comes up with surprisingly brilliant schemes, but for the purposes of completely pointless things. One can only wonder how successful he'd be if he put the effort into work that he puts into avoiding work.
</li><li> Shawn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> is a gifted observer, and he earned a <em>perfect score</em> on the detective's exam at age <em>15</em> for fun. He beat his dad at chess when he was eight, solved Sudoku upside down, and possesses an eidetic memory. Also shown to be a crack shot, as he hit all of detective Barry's bullet holes in the shooting range with zero training. He can't join the police force due to a past car theft as a teen (though that is a more complicated issue, read below) Instead, he took up a random string of jobs purely for their entertainment value. He opened his own "psychic" detective agency and is on contract with the Santa Barbara police department after solving a series of crimes from television reports. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a> because after solving all those crimes with his own criminal background he needed an explanation to avoid being convicted as an accomplice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a> also happens to pay well and allow him to be a lazy detective (psychic detectives are not required to take examinations or get licensed.) He is still something of a slacker, but when motivated, will work hard. However, in Season 6, he did make more mistakes, which his dad pointed out to due to becoming sloppy and not being challenged.
<ul><li> At least some of Shawn's laziness is explained as being a reaction against his father's absurdly overbearing attempts to groom him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps">Follow in My Footsteps</a> and become a police officer upon recognising his abilities. It's often implied that had his father just backed off a bit and let Shawn develop at his own pace more, Shawn would have likely been more willing to do so, or at least make more of his abilities than he did before the series. Though Henry Spencer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> and perfectionist in every aspect of his life (he once spent a few hours fishing with Lassiter... criticizing his technique the whole time). Lassiter was annoyed by it all that when he talked to Shawn about it, he admitted he began to understand a bit on why Shawn acts out.
</li><li> In his youth, Shawn was still planning on becoming a cop despite his dad's pushiness because he genuinely saw it as a good thing. But complications led to Henry and Madeline Spencer splitting (namely an educational opportunity for Maddie) and Henry took the fall so Shawn would not resent his mother. This led to quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a> for Shawn regarding his dad and he committed the felony to spite his dad and not be able to become a cop as a result. The Season 3 premiere has Shawn be told the truth about what happened by his mom and Shawn rebuilds his relationship more with his dad.

The only hospital that would hire him got around this by earmarking a "Department of Diagnostic Medicine," wherein House is pretty much allowed to screw around until a case that interests him and is beyond the ability of other doctors shows up. It's equalized by paying House <em>far</em> below what a doctor of his talents should earn. In most cases, it's a given that he will become involved eventually, but the other characters often have to talk him into it while he's busy playing video games or watching his soap operas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">or</a> downloading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">Internet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">porn</a>).

<ul><li> The Doctor exhibits this in most of his plans with the end result quite simple and easy. At least mentally. Physically he runs everywhere. And in "The Waters Of Mars" he wasn't even particularly keen on having to do that, asking why they couldn't have had bikes. Heck, pretty much every adventure he gets involved in results largely because he's happy enough to just bumble aimlessly through the universe and see where he ends up; he just happens to keep ending up right in the middle of trouble.
</li><li> Likewise a good number of his companions, e.g. Rose and Donna from the new series, have menial jobs and normal lives and never seem anything out of the ordinary. However, when they travel with the Doctor, they're forced to become braver, bold, quick thinking and rely on their atrophied but innate intelligence.
</li><li> Ditto for Amy, whose kissogram background hardly prepared her for, well, anything. Her boyfriend/husband Rory, though, is a nurse, who does occasionally have to make use of his medical knowledge.
</li><li> The past of the Doctor in the Academy, revealed during the Fourth Doctor's tenure, is a perfect example of this. While the Doctor is clearly a genius even by Time Lord standards, he is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>, mostly due to his hatred of structured learning and how extremely lazy he was in school. (The novelization of "Shada" contains a scene where the villain tries to read a secret Time Lord lecture from the Doctor's memory, only to find that the Doctor spent the whole lesson staring out of the window daydreaming about how much he'd like to have a picnic.) Romana, who got much, much better grades at the Academy than he did, is unconvinced by his intellect at first, but goes to accept that he is legitimately brilliant but at different things to her.
</li></ul></li><li> Detective Steve Billings from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>; brilliant police officer who at some point in his career, stopped giving a damn and went on auto-pilot while counting down to retirement. Loathed because of his laziness, his brilliance has saved him from being fired.
</li><li> Jim Halpert from the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> is lazy and unmotivated, yet he is still one of the top salesmen in all of Dunder-Mifflin. But when his job is on the line or when he wants to buckle down and work, he's among the most competent workers there.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pam:</strong> The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.

He'd much rather work on perfecting playing the E-flat, diminished ninth chord on his guitar. That's a <em>man's</em> chord. You could lose a finger.
</li><li> Buffy herself. She often skipped training or trained on her own time. It wasn't until Season 5 that she took training seriously.

He's clever enough to come up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Schemes</a> and write a School Survival Guide with very useful tips, and he could make straight A's if he would only try, but he never cares enough to do so.

It's probably the main reason he dropped out of MIT. Although it's also implied part of his reason was to spend more time with his mom, who was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">HIV-positive from getting stuck with an addict's needle, and in bad straits at the time for heath coverage to keep her alive.</span>

When Ronon accuses him of being a coward during a fight, Sheppard retorts that no, he's just lazy.

In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, he is shown to be just as smart as McKay. He just prefers to seem like a simpleton (a bit like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Jack O'Neill</a>, actually).
<ul><li> This applies even more so in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> episode "Vegas", where Sheppard doesn't join the Stargate program and ends up as a police detective in Las Vegas with drinking and gambling problems. And yet he is the only one who figures out where the Wraith is.

But she shows occasional signs of brilliance, like innate ability to discern the amount of a certain food product in a giant jar, and her ability to Houdini an A when she didn't bother doing a science report using just an orange from her bag.
</li><li> Onslow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em> is a working-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Fat Bastard</a> who mostly just stays home and watches telly.

</div></li><li> Dave Lister from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> certainly qualifies. Despite being the biggest slob in the galaxy, he is able to rebuild Kryten (twice), form a cunning scheme to defeat a time-travelling simulant that is capable of erasing people from history, display a knack for Esperanto (well, better than Rimmer anyway) and form philosophical opinions on a variety of themes. That Lister has brains but has never used them is the primary reason he was sentenced to being erased from existence by The Inquisitor (the above time-travelling simulant). Lister's response to claims he had wasted his talents: "So?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a> can appear this way initially; with his keen intelligence and lateral thinking skills, he could easily have been a great magician or a great detective if he so desired, but prefers the more anonymous life of a director and set designer for a stage illusionist, while rather reluctantly dabbling in detective work. As the series explores his character, it turns out to be not so much that Jonathan is lazy — being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneEmployee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneEmployee">Only Sane Employee</a> of the Adam Klaus magic show is extremely hard work — as that he's uncomfortable with the limelight and easily bored.

</li><li> Jess on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em>.

He eventually resurfaces in Rory's life as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a> who operates an independent publishing house/art gallery and is heavily involved in the Philadelphia arts scene.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown">LazyTown</a></em>'s Robbie Rotten is the epitome of this trope. He prides himself in being lazy, and even schemes to make the rest of the town's citizens as lazy as he is, yet he is easily the most brilliant person in the entire town and is able to create <em>anything</em> out of <em>anything</em>. He even has a microwave which makes inventions for him.
</li></ul><ul><li> Jeff on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>. It's gradually played with over the course of the series, in that while Jeff's quite smart and definitely very lazy, whenever he tries to coast on his wits something inevitably goes wrong and causes him more trouble than if he'd just put an honest effort in.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work.
</div></li><li> Surprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> completely averts it in Mycroft's case, to the point where it's something of a role-reversal: Mycroft is a high-ranking officer in the security services while Sherlock often requires a certain amount of prodding to apply his vast intellect to anything practical. Though a token nod to Mycroft's canonical dislike for actual physical labour is made in <em>The Great Game</em>, where he explains that his reason for not investigating a case himself - instead delegating it to a reluctant Sherlock - is its requiring "legwork."

It's left ambiguous whether this is them criticizing Leonard's work ethic or just showing disdain for his field of study, but it's left equally ambiguous whether Leonard went into Experimental Physics out of genuine interest or to avoid having to do theoretical work. That said, he's been published multiple times and he points out that science isn't just going to take Sheldon's "word for it" when he comes up with a theory, he's going to need someone like Leonard to test it. It doesn't help that both Mrs. Hofstader and Sheldon are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">insufferable geniuses</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a></em>, Xander is shown to be this. He's a natural leader and quite logical but his lazy attitude and dislike of being told what to do, often hold him back. But when the situation requires it and he tries his hardest, his plans often work very well in his favor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>, Dominic is a martial arts prodigy at least as skilled as RJ but avoids all responsibility and dropped out of the Pai Shwa academy and went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> rather than actually train or become a master.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>, Mike the Green Ranger is possibly the smartest out of the original five before Antonio came along. He is a master tactician who can make strategic battle plans effortlessly. However, he is incredibly lazy and would rather be playing video games and loves to rebel against authority.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaSteel">Power Rangers Ninja Steel</a></em>, Calvin is great at building or repairing anything mechanical and especially loves working on vehicles, but is also a bit too lackadaisical for his own good.

Several times she has been referred to as an evil genius (though evil is used 'very' loosely)
</li><li> Malcolm from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em>. It took until the sixth grade for anyone to even <em>notice</em> that he was a genius, which came as a huge shock to everyone, and in the first season, he hated being in an advanced class because he had to do twice as much homework as the regular kids when he'd rather be scheming with his brothers, playing games, or watching TV, as his portrayal was very much <em>not</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius">TV Genius</a>. In later seasons, he gradually became more serious about his studies because he became afraid of ending up a failure like his parents, but he remained lazy in other respects and a good chunk of his intelligence was still spent on stuff like teaching himself advanced child psychology so that he could fake mental disorders convincingly enough to be sent to therapy, and therefore get out of class periodically.
<ul><li> Reese also has shades of this. In the episode where Hal gets into a dispute with their garbage man, ands said garbage man dump his truck's full load onto their lawn, Reese, with Hal in tow, steals a fully loaded garbage truck with the intent of dumping it on the garbage man's lawn. Hal tells Reese that he could achieve so much if he applied his energy towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">his education</a> the way he does with any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a>, but realizes "that ship sailed long ago."
</li></ul></li><li> Axel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle">The Middle</a></em> is thought to be that in one episode; it turns out his test results were just switched with a classmate who is actually brilliant.

His mother seems amazed he somehow passed history after he thought President Lincoln lived in Gettysburg and died at the movies (he refers to him as that Abe guy with the beard and the hat.). However, he's probably as smart as his overachieving twin brother Cody, but often lacks proper motivation and would rather coast through life than put in the work. He has been shown when putting in the effort to be an excellent student in even English which he failed. Part of the problem is that Cody is so smart that Zack feels that no matter how good his grades are or how well he does on an assignment, he will always be overshadowed by what his genius brother does.
</li><li> Sergeant Schulz (the rank given is Hauptfeldtwebel, the equivalent of NATO E-8, or U.S. Army Senior Master Sergeant) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em> pretends to be a bumbling idiot because he likes smooth, friction-free shifts. However, when he takes over command of the camp (and thusly will have to take the blame if someone finds out about any of the <em>many</em> irregularities in the camp) he becomes such an unholy terror Hogan and his team spend the rest of the episode getting Colonel Klink reinstated. Also, in later episodes it's stated that he is not only a decorated veteran of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, he also built up a very large and successful toy business in the interbellum years, and only re-enlisted because his factory was appropriated for the war effort and he was conscripted.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em>, Lewis has a genius-level intellect but works as a janitor because he'd rather not apply himself to anything more challenging than cleaning toilets.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, Mortimer Harren is a brilliant cosmologist who has five university degrees on the subject and who only joined Starfleet because a school he wanted to attend required a year of practical experience. Torres tried to give him jobs that would utilize his vast intellect, but he refused to do the work because he thought anything other than cosmology was beneath him. She eventually gave up on him and gave him the easiest job in the department. In the episode he appeared in this was made somewhat ridiculous because it <em>also</em> established that the crewwoman who they actually had doing cosmology was completely unqualified and hated her job.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conviction2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conviction2016">Conviction (2016)</a></em>, Hayes Morrison is an excellent defense attorney but spent years as a disreputable law professor because, as the daughter of a former President of the United States, she was burned out from all the public attention she got growing up and wanted to keep a low profile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatBritishBakeOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatBritishBakeOff">The Great British Bake Off</a></em>: Rob of series 2, an attractive, charming, clearly talented young baker with a distinctly offhand attitude to time management, resulting in a series of great-tasting but visually disastrous bakes. This drove Paul <em>insane</em>.
<ul><li> Selasi of series 7 gained a reputation for always being chilled even if his time management was all over the place. How much time he spent lying on the floor became something of a running gag.
</li></ul></li><li> Eleanor Shellstrop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em>. She concluded fairly early on that being a good person who cared about others was hard work, and as a result, abdicated most moral decisions in favor of going along with whatever was most convenient or what someone else proposed. At the same time, she's generally shown to be a lot smarter than she's given credit for; at one point, an essay she writes for Chidi did only marginally worse than that handed in by the highly educated Tahani, and the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">Reveal</a> for season 1 came about because she figured out the underlying truth that eluded even Chidi and Tahani.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodOmens2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodOmens2019">Good Omens (2019)</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Crowley</a> is a classic example of someone who is brilliant <em>because</em> he's lazy. Instead of going through all the time and effort of doing things the traditional way, he invents new ways that are more efficient and require less effort on his part. In one of his first scenes, the demons Hastur and Ligur report how they corrupted a priest and a politician. Crowley reports that he downed all the mobile networks in London, which will piss off millions of people, who will spread that low-grade evil around and increase the overall evil in the world significantly more than corrupting one or two souls, no matter how important.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a></em> shows two examples from both the American and the British version:
<ul><li> In the British version we have Mamma Cherri. When Ramsay tried her food, he actually cleaned his plate - which is something that he has <em>never</em> done. (Unless it was a particularly good dessert.) The focus of the episode wasn't fixing the food, but improving the restaurant's structure and Cherri's marketing ability. Again, her main fault was that she would try to take the quickest possible option, which led to her having a bit of a fall in quality, but now she actually does quite well. Allegedly she said that she just should never be put in a managerial position.
</li><li> Lisa from Lido di Manhattan. She just graduated from business school - so she was clearly booksmart. However, at the time she was one of Ramsay's most <em>helpless</em> cases, even going to cry in the bathroom. When Ramsay returned, he was genuinely impressed at how much Lisa had turned it around, one of the few who had updated his menu and on top of that has launched her own wine brand.

He has accomplished exactly nothing else—well, he did also invent an infectious and terrible zombie plague, but more or less forgot about it once a chance at overly-convoluted revenge against people who have no idea what's going on presented itself—and only halfheartedly stirs himself when his Neverborn masters force him to. As a result, he's viewed as lower in respect amongst the Deathlords than the one that was <em>almost fed to Oblivion</em> for her screw-ups.

</li><li> Every so often, gamers actually fit this trope themselves. This is especially prevalent in multiplayer games, wherein a player may <em>know</em> the game, and in some cases even more than their team/clan leader... but they just don't want to be the ones in charge. They may know the fights, they know what everyone is supposed to do, but hate being the one telling others what to do and would rather let the others take control.

This is reflected in his fighting style; it's completely rough and unpolished, full of wild swings and haymakers. He deliberately holds back massively on the vast majority of opponents, mostly because he can't be bothered to make the effort, and it's suggested that not even his hated enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">That Man</a> is able to get more than 50% of his full potential out of him - not that it matters much, seeing how as Sol is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> Gear, he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curbstompbattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curbstompbattle">curbstomp</a> most of the cast at only <em>10%</em> of it.

He was smart enough to get a job as a detective, but his lack of effort makes him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">ineffectual laughingstock</a> to the rest of the Inaba police department. When he actually <em>does</em> focus on his work, though, he can be pretty effective. His social link in <em>Golden</em> also highlights his boredom with the countryside, tendency to cut corners in work, and his desire for a woman to do all his cooking and cleaning for him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, the <em>protagonist</em> will come off as this as long as the player is maxing stats. He's consistently shown slacking off in class, but is considered one of the more intelligent members of the team and will regularly make above-average to top-ten grades if the player knows what they're doing.

They're far more technologically advanced than the other inhabitants of New LA, and their engineering know-how helps the humans to further stake a claim on Mira. Unfortunately, their long reliance on gizmos means that they're culturally more used to letting the machines do most of the work while they sit back and relax, in contrast to the typical work ethic of many humans. One particular case study is a Ma-non who was fired from a human business for spending most of the day napping and eating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">pizza</a>.
</li><li> Rufus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Fat Bastard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSlob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSlob">slob</a> who loves to eat, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">fighting style</a> leaves almost all other characters impressed. It is actually the product of Rufus deciding to emulate what he saw in Kung Fu movies, and the resulting long, rigorous training under various Kung Fu masters around the world as he sorted out what moves in those films were practical or actually useless. After this burst of dedication, he never bothered to try shedding his considerable bulk to further improve himself. The other characters' win quotes are a combination of compliments for Rufus' skill and contemplating how much stronger he could be if he only made the effort to lose weight.
</li><li> In a downplayed example, the Engineer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> has 11 PhDs, is the inventor of a machine equivalent to the Medic, turrets from hell and gadgets literally able to teleport people to one place to another. His relaxed attitude, the defensive strategy of the class (set up somewhere and then don't move), and his Rancho Relaxo taunt is what gives him this position, as well as his cosmetics the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit">Level Three Chin</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit">Egghead's Overalls</a>.

</li><li> Roger Wilco from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> might be considered this as he is extremely resourceful and inventive but is also extremely squeamish and begins his very first adventure by waking up from a nap he took during his work shift.
</li><li> As noted above, the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> tends to be portrayed as this, though it usually is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> how much this trope applies. Generally speaking, Sonic is pretty laid back about his heroics and is mostly seen relaxing whenever he's not fighting Eggman. Overall, he tends to treat heroism as an afterthought and never really takes it seriously unless the circumstances call for it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, the blacksmith <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Sunshine</a> is so deeply mired in depression from his work stagnating that he's unwilling to even get out of bed. However, if you bring him raw materials or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust">rusty ancient weapons</a>, he becomes inspired enough to instantly forge or refurbish them into masterpieces.
</li><li> Shun Akiyama of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza4">Yakuza 4</a></em> is a slovenly-looking fella who has scruffy hair and hobo stubble, almost never cares about keeping his office clean and runs a money-lending company rather poorly, always sleeping on the job, missing deadlines to goof off and is even seen sleeping on a couch in his full business suit in the opening moments of the game. Yet despite this, he's a business grad from a top level university, has keen enough senses to notice when even the slightest thing in his office has been meddled with by intruders and said company he runs has been so successful that he went from only having enough to start it up to sitting on 100 billion yen by the time the game begins. And of course like other <em>Yakuza</em> protagonists, he's skilled in martial arts, specifically using a fast and precise kick-based fighitng style and taunts to befuddle and down his enemies.
</li><li> Leona Kingscholar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedWonderland">Twisted Wonderland</a></em> is incredibly smart and could easily excel if he put in any effort, but would rather nap and laze around than work hard for things he has little interest in. This may be stem from his upbringing, being constantly compared to his more successful elder brother.

<ul><li> Fighter is indisputably a capable fighter, but early strips have him flashing back to tuning out his mentor and he later undergoes a "Trial of Sloth" that makes it explicit he's well below his actual potential.

Askey can't be bothered to go to classes, as all he wants to do is play video games or make video games. Thrasher is the son of a supervillain and uses his superpowers to... thrash on a skateboard. Fantastico has Exemplar skills and perfect memory, but couldn't be bothered to write a paper for English class (he has money too, so he paid one of his minions to write it).

<ul><li> Jake the Dog in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> has shades of this. He wields incredible shape-shifting powers and could easily defeat most enemies that appear in the show if he applied himself, but he'd much rather be at a party or eating a sandwich. That, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Finn</a> has so much fun battling things.
</li><li> Spud from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong">American Dragon: Jake Long</a></em> is a genius, but he thinks being focused on the books all the time is boring. He also believes due to experiences in his early childhood that if he shows his genius he will be faced with high and stressful expectations. As such he doesn't just not use his intellect but deliberately hides it. However, he does realize that indulging too much in laziness is also unhealthy. His genius is revealed when Jake tricks him into acing an IQ test.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> certainly counts. While on the surface, Sterling Archer is a brainless egotist, the show makes it clear he genuinely <em>is</em> the world's most dangerous spy. Archer boasts unparalleled skills in almost every field needed to be a secret agent, incredible and in-depth knowledge about a wide variety of topics (some quite obscure), and some outright savant-like genius abilities. He's even able to count the number of shots being fired from multiple guns being used simultaneously in a fire-fight and keep track of exactly how many bullets each shooter has left. Unfortunately he's also a selfish hedonist who's concern isn't whatever mission he's supposed to be handling but rather his own comfort and (short-sighted) entertainment. His main motivation for being a secret agent seems to mostly be so he can travel the world getting drunk and bedding women.
</li><li> Buster from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> - in one episode he admits to having never read a book. His friends try unsuccessfully getting him to read increasingly simple books ("The sky is blue. The ocean is blue..."). The next day Buster shows up at school with Arthur's several-hundred-page book about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a> saying he's almost done with it - because it was the only one he actually found interesting.

However, she quickly surpasses him in waterbending skills because he would rather play around than focus. The lazy aspect later becomes an issue when he's learning earthbending because as an airbender his instincts go entirely against what he's learning, leaving him unable to make any progress. He quickly becomes discouraged and it's not until Sokka's life is in danger that he can finally work through his mental block and learn to stand his ground against a problem instead of just dodging it as an airbender would.
<ul><li> This seems to be the case with Admiral Zhao. During his fight with Aang he unleashes some truly impressive firebending but is too easily goaded into anger to use his skills effectively. His old teacher even states that Zhao was too impatient to learn the discipline involved in properly controlling his powers.
</li><li> Aang's successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">Korra</a> has a similar problem to him as well; she's incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and excels in the more fast-paced aspects of her position (fighting being the best example), but the slower-paced parts (such as diplomacy and spiritual meditation) don't hold her interest for very long and she ends up getting herself into far more trouble than she can handle at times.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cluemaster from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> was a dangerous example. A child genius, he lost a rigged game show for such children and did NOT take it well. He became a recluse, doing nothing for decades but plotting revenge against everyone involved. Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">calls him out on this</a>, telling him that he could have accomplished so much in his life (like his intended victims did) if he hadn't let his pride bring him to ruin.
</li></ul><ul><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> is hardly lazy when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">seeking revenge,</a> but he would rather watch TV and attend conventions than do pretty much anything with his life. And considering some of the things he does in the process of getting revenge, he probably would be quite successful if he was actually willing to work for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>'s title character, who easily gets good grades but is too apathetic to do any of the other activities people try to rope her into (until she is either forced or bribed, anyway). Her best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Jane</a> is similar, but in her case, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">not so much brilliance</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneWoman">common sense</a> and artistic talent.

He's still capable of amazing feats of intelligence when sufficiently motivated, like get-rich-quick schemes that tend to only fail due to bad luck or a simple oversight, and in one episode runs a very successful underground gambling ring. It's best summed up when Dilbert hears a scheme of Wally's to steal money from credit card companies:

He's cunning enough to think up scams that can actually be rather brilliant at times, though he often heaps the heavy-lifting parts of building his scams off to Ed and Double D and struggles academically, though he'll occasionally make a comment or reference to people or events that imply he's smarter than he seems. Overall, he is clever, but apparently bored easily to the point of avoiding any sort of studying and notes from his teachers imply he may have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">ADD or ADHD</a>-type disorder.

One episode outright shows the mental math he uses when using one of his bio-mechanical weapons, all of which are implied to have been consciously designed.

Although he spends most of his time doing mindless stunts, he puts a lot of technical effort into all of them, which requires high levels of precision, building and planning in order to safely accomplish. He often manages to figure out how to drive a wide variety of vehicles in his pursuit of daredevil action. He also managed to finish an entire months' worth of homework (mostly physics) twice in one day... the latter one in under 10 minutes.

The one time she actually applied herself, she took over the world... and even then, she had to be motivated and given the tools by her <em>future self</em>. But for the most part, she would rather be on the beach, filing her gloves (don't ask), or lazing about reading "Villains' Magazine" than actually working, though she does enjoy her fights with Kim.

However, getting them to actually record new material, play shows or... anything, really, takes <em>serious</em> prodding. And even among the band members, Toki Wartooth and William Murderface stand out. Neither participates in the band's songwriting process, and it's been established that Toki doesn't even bother to practice. Murderface, meanwhile, just really, really doesn't feel like making an effort for any reason. But when forced, they managed to record an entire album - and apparently a good one - by themselves. And Toki <em>is</em> the second-fastest guitarist in the world and Murderface can play bass with his genitals.

In "Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3", she has absolutely no interest in <em>any</em> of the teaching techniques her friends try to use to teach her the History of the Wonderbolts, which she needs to pass a test to get into the famous team but didn't think she needed to worry about, leading to her neglecting it. However late in the episode, she demonstrates an ability to pick up any and <em>every</em> detail she sees while flying, which leads to Twilight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> on how to get the history into her head.

Unfortunately, she doesn't dedicate the effort she puts in attacking villains the way into her schoolwork. This extends to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">2016 series</a>, where despite being uninterested in academics, she's smart enough to be in advanced math classes with minimal effort.

</li><li> Mordecai and Rigby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> are quite lazy much of the time, but when they actually get around to working, they're pretty efficient. Rigby especially, who always thinks he can talk his way out of everything - until he actually screws up, that is, at which point he panics. Mordecai is the only one who can motivate Rigby to work, and Rigby being there is the main thing that motivates Mordecai to work (other than Benson's rage). Benson knows this, which is part of the reason why he could never fire Rigby on his own and hire someone else. By the end of the series, they kick this habit: Rigby spends an entire season going back to high school to finish his degree, while the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

Quite a few plotlines are started by him being faced with a problem he finds inconsequential and whipping up a quick and easy solution in response that tends to have disastrous side-effects attached to it.
<ul><li> In "Something Ricked This Way Comes" he creates a robot with artificial intelligence for the sole purpose of getting him butter when he's eating.
</li><li> In the Season 3 finale "The Rickchurian Mortydate" he negotiates peace between Israel and Palestine, just to spite the President.
</li><li> A <em>very</em> brief list of his inventions includes cybernetic prosthetic limbs, teleportation, interdimensional travel, faster-than-light space travel, a device that freezes time, shrinking technology, advanced cloning technology, and memory manipulation. He hoards all of these technologies in his garage for his own use.
</li></ul></li><li> Twister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>, while certainly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Ditz</a>, can be a surprisingly effective captain for his friends, coming up with brilliant plays and training techniques. However, in the end, he gives the team captain slot back to Otto because he doesn't like the pressure.
</li><li> Tommys father Stu Pickles from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a> is very smart when it comes to building things and making advanced toys and machines that work very well, otherwise he spends most of his time lounging around the house watching television and unintentionally forgetting to look after Tommy and the other babies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bart Simpson is a good example. He can be pretty cunning, deductive, and intelligent when he puts his mind to it, particularly when up against his nemesis Sideshow Bob, but in school, he'd rather do the bare minimum (if that). He mastered two languages (Spanish and French) in a relatively short time. Only to 'forget' French and literally have Spanish knocked out of him. And Japanese along with Homer after a short while in jail. This also shown mixed with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">short attention span</a> where he's willing to do <em>algebraic equations</em> as a distraction from the ten-page book report he was assigned. When an aptitude test shows that he's not useless and is suited to be a police officer, he unleashes that potential. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">For a while</a>. <br/><br/>This also overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>, as when he actually does try in one episode, he technically still fails the test. He only manages to pass because he related his experience to something he read in his studies, which got him extra credit for "applied knowledge". A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> shows that he will be a Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, made even more impressive in that in a not-as-far flash forward, he went to night school for his law degree. Then again, in almost all the others, he's a bum, or at least hardly works. However, it is all presented in chronological order: he spends his early adulthood in a troubled state and as a bum before getting a job in demolition to work out his anger (while also going to night school) and eventually becomes a Chief Justice in his older adult years. This is all in spite of the Simpsons Gene, which leads to Simpsons men as adults.
</li><li> Homer also qualifies, frequently (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">maybe it's genetic?</a>) displaying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">a surprising amount intelligence for whatever this week's obsession is</a>. Across various episodes he's become a top employee for Globex, started a very successful home security business, and was able to trick Mr. Burns into making him CEO of the power plant, which he did in revenge for his rather comprehensive safety report being ignored. Also like Bart, he displays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> tendencies, rarely reading books while also retaining an amazing breadth of knowledge, including at least some awareness of the works of Walt Whitman, how to brew several varieties of beer, and at least some knowledge of the laws of thermodynamics, despite not knowing who Isaac Newton is. It's just that, much like Bart, he's only willing to put in the minimum effort.
</li><li> Another example on the show is Barney Gumble, Homer's barfly of a friend, who has proven to have a lot of talents when he isn't drinking. In fact, a flashback showed that he was Harvard-bound as a teenager until Homer introduced him to beer on the night before they had to take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SATs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SATs">SATs</a>. Probably the biggest example was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">the poignant and touching movie</a> he directed and starred in about his alcoholism. (The only really bad thing about the otherwise excellent film was the title, <em>Pukahontas</em>.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Barney:</strong> Hi, Homer. Since they made me stop drinking, I've regained my balance and diction! Observe: [does backflips] "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance">I am the very model of a modern major general, I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral.</a>"
</div></li><li> Krusty is almost emblematic of hacky comedians, but several episodes suggest he has a lot of potential. The biggest is probably "The Last Temptation of Krust", where he decides to try out stand-up and finds some success as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>. However, Krusty sticks with stolen Steve Martin bits and poorly-timed vaudeville slapstick because he believes firmly that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">kids are the most profitable demographic</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">kids will watch anything.</a>
</li><li> Jeff Albertson, the Comic Book Guy is probably the biggest example on the show. He's actually a member of Mensa, and does tend to talk like a "book smart" (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">snobbish and egotistical</a>) type, and he once did write and self-publish a comic book called <em>Everyman</em> that was a brief success (and cancelled it later when he condoned the movie it was made into, even if it meant dismissing the chance for more money and potential for another film closer to the source material) but usually all he does with his smarts is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman">profiteering</a> (Maybe it makes sense at first that he can justify charging $150 for a photo of Sean Connery that was signed by Roger Moore, as he did in one episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan">but when you think about it for a few minutes...)</a>. And he's definitely lazy, being a morbidly obese couch potato who doesn't give a damn about his health, in one episode buying a hundred tacos for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> marathon. (In another episode he admitted to being a 45-year-old virgin who still lives with his mother.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>; Slouchy Smurf. He rarely makes much effort to do anything, but unlike Lazy Smurf - who's simply lazy - he has a lot of good ideas  in his debut episode in the cartoon he invented the paper airplane and the saxophone just by idly messing about. He became a lot less lazy after being de-aged to a Smurfling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">(Maybe because kids have more energy?)</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, Tails berates Sonic for slacking off while Tails is washing the dishes. Sonic then uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> to dry them in a second. <em>It ain't the speed, it's the deep, keed!</em>.
</li><li> This character trait <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess">also invokes a lot of Princess Sally's nitpicking towards Sonic</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Cartman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> has repeatedly shown his aptitude for manipulating others and pulling off elaborate schemes for his own petty benefit, but would never go to such lengths for his academic development. At one point he starts a thorough investigation on Token Black because he failed his math test despite cheating off his classmate. Token even points out that if Cartman put that amount of effort studying for the test then he wouldn't need to copy off Token's answers.
</li><li> Squidward from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> is already one of the smartest characters on the show and would be extremely competent if not for his extreme apathy to everything. In <em>Opposite Day</em> he rebuilt SpongeBob's entire <em>house</em> all by himself, something that, due to him hating his neighbor and wanting nothing to do with him, didn't bother to do in <em>Home Sweet Pineapple</em>. In <em>A Breath of Fresh Squidward</em> his personality is inverted so that he's incredibly enthusiastic and cheerful about everything, and as a result, manages to beat SpongeBob's Employee of the Month winning streak.
</li><li> Star Butterfly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> is a magical prodigy, described as being far beyond the skill level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">her mother Queen Moon</a> and on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Eclipsa</a> (the most notorious magic user in Mewni's history, who created magic so dangerous that her chapter of the royal spellbook is sealed). She's able to "dip down" and use magic solely from her own power (normally the assistance of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand">Magic Wand</a> is required) at the age of 14 (something her mother never managed until she was 19), and constantly invents new spells off the top her head (which are often more powerful than she intended them to be). But Star is incapable of using the most basic magic because she found it too boring to bother learning. Which in turn leads to Star having poor <em>control</em> over her magic, with her spells sometimes failing to work, being more powerful than intended and causing collateral damage, or going completely wrong and having an effect completely unrelated to what she intended.
</li><li> Control Freak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>.

Rusty in particular, though he is capable of creating numerous death-dealing devices and created a process to cheat death through cloning and computer memory back-up, would rather sit on his ass and leech off his dead father's reputation than earn respect and admiration through his own inventions.
<ul><li> Rusty is a tragic example in the sense that he has <em>plenty</em> of issues due to how being a boy adventurer would actually be as well as the hell his father and his friends put him through. It is implied that if he did overcome the vast neuroses and psychological issues, he could surpass his father, regarding the best super scientist.

He's more interested in daydreaming and goofing off, it it is strongly implied on multiple occasions that he's the most talented of the bunch. In the 5th episode in particular, he completely tanked a battle because he failed to pay attention to Omi's lecture, but then spent the rest of the next day studying hard and absolutely trounced the same enemy.
</li><li> The ancient hero Chi Master Dashi is shown to be this; after saving the world once, he'd rather sit back, let his dragon do the cleanup work, and avoid people he doesn't know that are trying to look for him. Once he finds out a problem is serious, however, he agrees to help.

However, after a long and successful career of heroism, he believes he's earned the right to lounge around and do nothing. He's only training Yin and Yang because the Woo Foo Spirits wouldn't leave him alone until he did. In terms of how capable he was, he was stronger and more skilled than <em>Yin and Yang combined</em> even when he was <em>three years old</em> (as shown in an episode where he is de-aged.)

<ul><li> Many gifted kids, especially those who are "undiscovered" are this — they can do what others struggle to do with minimal work, and sometimes never develop a good work ethic. Oftentimes this leads to difficulties later in life, as work genuinely becomes challenging and they have no idea how to begin to handle it. This usually results in depression problems. On the other hand, college and introductory training are in large part <em>designed</em> for this, and they help people develop work ethics if they haven't already. Many gifted kids skate through elementary school without being challenged. When they actually have to work to learn something, they become frustrated and shut down. They don't understand why the answer doesn't just pop in their head. This is why it is important to challenge them early and often so they know what it feels like to actually learn something. This concept of challenge is often referred to as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">zone of proximal development<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by educators. On top of that, a lot of these gifted kids are known to be a part of the Autism Spectrum (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a>), ADHD, or some other pervasive developmental disorder that causes them to be poorly catered for.
<ul><li> On the subject of ADHD, a variation of this trope is on effect; not because of laziness, but due to the inability to focus on the task at hand. Being called lazy is usually a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>, as many really want to do something but literally can't. They can be extremely talented, intelligent and creative, yet can't use any of these virtues due to poor memory, inability to focus, etc. For example, someone could be very good in poetry, only to forget what they were thinking about by the time they grab the nearest pen; chores can also be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> to some, due to the boring, repetitive nature.
</li></ul></li><li> It's said that people become good workers for exactly this reason. They're in the habit of figuring out easier ways to get things done. As the joke goes "there's an easier way to do this, and I'll find it if it takes me all day." This can backfire though, as touched by an <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/1319/">xkcd comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</div></li><li> Hobbyist programmers spend most of their programming time writing tools to do work for them so they don't have to. Programmers, in general, will do their best to complete their work with the minimum amount of effort - programming anything remotely complex can take a <em>really</em> long time of sitting down writing, and writing, and <em>writing</em>. As well, writing as little as possible avoids issues with redundancy in the code to make later bug-fixing difficult while making the code easy and intuitive to interpret for others. On the flip side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker">a programmer has to learn how to be as lazy as possible while programming as well</a>.

</li><li> Commonly seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopaths and psychopaths</a>. Often noted to be wasting their talent. Even though they are usually smart, they are often unreliable and see nothing wrong with living off of theft, money conned from others, or mooching off of family members. They rarely apply their intellect to their crimes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> was legendary for not bothering to memorize his lines before going on set (in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em>, he hadn't even <em>read</em> the script), often forcing directors to provide him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueCard">Cue Cards</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Improv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Improv">just improvising</a>. He won two Academy Awards for his acting and was nominated for six more. And when shooting a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em> where he was saying goodbye to Kal-El before sending him to Earth, he read all of his lines off of the baby's diapers.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> admitted that he spends most of his time watching TV or building plastic models. When writing a manga, he always puts it off until the end of the week, storyboarding, drawing, inking, and submitting each chapter within the last two days. While Toriyama considers it proof of his laziness, many have been left awestruck at the incredible work ethic and talent needed to pump out a week's worth of material in just a day and a half.
</li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a> who liked to posture as a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Idle Rich</a> but in fact was a bit of a workaholic, having two plays performing in the West End and a bestselling book published in the same year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was described by his teachers as having unlimited talent but being too arrogant and lazy to actually do anything with it. Joseph Goebbels complained in his diary that during the 1920s and 30s when they were on the campaign trail, it was often up to him to track Hitler down due to Hitlers' habit of wandering off to hang around artists and bohemian types, even when he was scheduled for important meetings or speeches; when he became Chancellor and briefly started working hard, Goebbels' quipped to a colleague "You'll never believe this- the Boss is working". Even after becoming Chancellor, he soon became more inclined to take long walks, play with his dogs and watch movies than actually run his country because he thought that the affairs of government would just take care of themselves if you didn't interfere too much, and rarely involved himself in matters of state unless they were important to him like foreign affairs, military buildup, euthanasia or anti-Semitism.
</li><li> During the golden era of heavyweight boxing, it was rumored that boxing great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> was this way. A brilliant boxing talent that hardly trained for fights and spent most of his time partying and chasing women. His out-spoken bragging behavior seemed to reinforce this idea, which was done intentionally to fool his opponents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>, however, as his trainer Angelo Dundee made it clear that Muhammad Ali was always the first one in the gym, and the last one to leave it while preparing for his fights.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a> was like this during his school days. He notes that during his four years at Oxford, he did about 1000 hours of work (equating to about an hour-and-a-half for each day.) This earned him the ire of his teachers. At the end of his four years, the deans weren't sure if he deserved a first-class or second-class degree, due to the quality of his work. Hawking said that a first-class degree would get him into Cambridge; otherwise, he'd have to stay at Oxford for his graduate work. The deans gave him a first-class degree.
</li><li> Bill Gates, who is known as an intense workaholic, has said that he often hires lazy people to do the hardest tasks because they will find the easiest way to do it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBukowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBukowski">Charles Bukowski</a> gave up writing for ten years because he stopped caring about it and grew fed up with publishing. He admitted that he was hopelessly lazy and unambitious and spent years in a low-paying position in a post office. It wasn't until he nearly died of a bleeding ulcer that he started writing again. After that, he became extremely productive with his poetry. His protagonist Henry Chinaski was the epitome of this trope too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> is well known as a brilliant writer and one of the most important in Science Fiction. He was also a notorious procrastinator who missed deadlines constantly and often had to be locked in hotel rooms by publishers and forced to work. Related to the programmer example above, in his book <em>Last Chance To See</em> he mentions wasting about 45 minutes writing a program to calculate the volume of a particular type of bird's nest. Actually calculating this by hand would have taken seconds, but now he has a program to do it for him in case he ever needs to do it again. Which he won't. He just felt like doing it. (The bird in question, incidentally, has a very unusual nest because it's basically a massive compost heap forming a primitive incubator, and the bird is constantly adding or removing material to keep it at a constant temperature, thereby relieving it of the need to sit on its eggs. Adams very much identified with this.)
</li><li> Trym Torson of famous black metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Emperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Emperor">Emperor</a> is renowned as a technical drummer but claims to only sit behind a kit during band practice. Compare the similarly skilled Jan Axel Blomberg of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> who plays 6 hours of drums a day whether his band is around or not.
</li><li> The poet Dorothy Parker is a well-known example and by her own admission. Even though she became famous through her poems and essays, she loathed the actual work of writing (I hate writing, I love having written"), and no doubt her alcoholism and bouts with depression made the writing process even more difficult for her.
</li><li> All-Star pitcher, National League MVP, Cy Young Award Finalist and three-time World Series Champion Curt Schilling was this. Back when he was just starting out with the Boston Red Sox he didn't take training all that seriously. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Clemens-inspired-young-Schilling-1059411.php">However, pitching legend Roger Clemens of all people noticed Schilling in the weight room one day, just "going through the motions", while Clemens was engaging in one of his notoriously rigorous workouts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He called the younger pitcher over, and while neither has divulged the specifics of the conversation, Clemens basically gave Schilling a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass">Dare to Be Badass</a></em> in which he told the younger pitcher he should stop screwing around and get serious about training, and become the pitcher he could be. According to Schilling, it totally changed his entire life and career and resulted in a career that will be considered for the Hall of Fame.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> did poorly at school because while he excelled at subjects that interested him (such as English or history) he refused to learn the ones that didn't (such as Latin or mathematics).
</li><li> A common saw among boxing trainers is that knockout power will do this to a fighter. He storms through his early opponents, then the first time he faces someone who can take a punch doesn't know what to do with himself when the bell rings to start the fifth round or so since he invariably lacks both stamina and technical skill. So common, in fact, that it's practically a cliché when the color commentator talks about the potential for a fight to turn into this during the show open.
</li><li> Boxer Joey Giardello was a naturally talented athlete and held the Middleweight title for two years, but also did not take training very seriously and lived on a diet mostly of pasta and beer, this lead to rumors that his victories were due to mob ties and also fuelled suspicion that his victory over "Hurricane" Carter was the result of racism as depicted in the movie made about Carter's life. Everyone present at the actual fight, including Carter himself, however, agree that Giardello was the superior boxer.
</li><li> Numerous musicians are like this with new albums, often taking years off at a time.
</li><li> According to an oft-cited quote (variously attributed to Napoleon, von Moltke, von Manstein, and many others), this is the qualification to be the top military commander. The quote divides military officers to four categories: brilliant but lazy are suited for high command; brilliant and energetic, the general staff; stupid and lazy, the routine jobs. The stupid and the energetic should be kicked out of the army as soon as they are identified.
</li><li> Mensa International counts a sizeable number of unemployed among its membership base.
</li><li> A common description of Marshal Saint-Cyr: he was a master of defensive warfare and overall an excellent general, but it took a lot of pushing and prodding to get him to move his troops. Others would say that he was "lazy" out of spite, letting his fellow generals suffer heavy losses before sweeping in to save the day.
</li><li> Any kind of expert employed by someone who is not an expert in the same field can become this because of the principal-agent problem. Experts exist to know what their employers do not know. If your employer or supervisor does not understand your work, then they cannot effectively hold you accountable for your mistakes. Because of this, it is very easy for paid experts to rationalize away lack of due diligence when their work is not vetted by their peers. That is why scientific papers need to be peer-reviewed before they can be published, and why physicians are regulated by governments and medical associations.
</li><li> Students who get very high standardized test scores but don't get good grades in school are often accused of being this to some degree.
</li><li> While being critically acclaimed in his country, the Brazilian writer Aníbal Machado has a work consisting of just a few short stories and one novel. This novel, called <em>João Ternura</em>, was written for around 45 years, with interruptions in the meantime, only been published posthumously.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MyersBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MyersBriggs">MBTI</a> intuitive-thinking (NT) types, especially xNTP types, are prone to this.
</li><li> Collaborators all say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais">Ricky Gervais</a> hates doing anything that he considers boring and will foist as much work as possible onto other people while he does the bare minimum. This actually led to the creation of his most enduring creative partnership as he originally hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenMerchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenMerchant">Stephen Merchant</a> to be a general dogsbody around the office.
</li><li> When measured for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BigFivePersonalityTraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BigFivePersonalityTraits">Big Five Traits</a>, artists and entrepreneurs tend to have high Openness (a trait associated with intelligence) but often have low or moderate levels of Conscientiousness (hard work and organization).
</li><li> King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> of England was a brilliant Renaissance man who wrote several works and enjoyed sports, particularly hunting and jousting. At the same time though, he lacked political skills, leaving the running of England to his chancellors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming">Ian Fleming</a> began writing from a young age and was so good that a cheap spy novel he banged out drunk in his vacation home <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">spawned one of the biggest franchises in the world</a>, but he struggled to acquire a career in his youth due to his love of alcohol, women, and slacking off. His mother attempted <em>four times</em> to set him up, failing to enter the Royal Military College due to a case of gonorrhea and not doing well enough on the Foreign Office entry exam to become a diplomat. Family pressure pushed him into banking, which he was also unsuccessful at, but journalism ended up finally inciting his passion for writing and led to a job with Naval Intelligence. As long as he had something that interested him, he was brilliant.
