They've been fighting for so long that no one can remember anything except the war. Sometimes, both sides will have an infinite supply of troops via some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>.

One side may exist simply to fight the other but despite their best efforts their foes remain indomitable. Perhaps one group simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">enjoys fighting so much</a> that they don't want to stop, or maybe there are political or economic advantages to constant warfare. Though the most common reason would be that the two factions had a reason to fight long ago and at this point the concept of peace is simply foreign to their culture.
</p><p>If by some miracle one side <em>does</em> manage to win it usually isn't portrayed as a good thing. Questions like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">"And Then What?"</a> might come up — they've become so used to war that they don't know what they will do now that there is no longer someone to fight.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> is something of a meta example. There are over a dozen TV series in it already and every one is built entirely around a war in different settings and characters. You'd think that the entire Gundam metaverse is in the state of perpetual war (especially true for the Universal Century, where many of the wars are explicit continuations of previous ones). To go even further, the series almost always (with a couple notable exceptions such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em>) compounds the reality that no matter how many times the heroes win the war, another will come eventually as if war is tied to humanity's existence.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAge">Gundam AGE</a></em> has the longest-running <em>continuous</em> war in <em>Gundam</em>: when it finally ends, it has been over 75 years since the start, encompassing a full three generations of protagonists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> meanwhile implies that the Dark History <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">i.e. ALL <em>Gundam</em> works made up till that point</span> was for the most part <em>the same war</em> between Earth and Spacenoids happening over and over. The only real difference being the names of the sides fighting.
</li></ul></li><li> The war between Earth and "Jovian Lizards" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>, which gets incredibly stupid and pointless once we learn why and how it started.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>: Knowing nothing but war and aggression, most Zentraedi did not realize that there was another way of life. They've been fighting the same war, against the same enemy, for at least 20,000 years (and likely much longer than that) when the series begins.
<ul><li> The Invid of <em>Robotech</em> are aware of the cause of their war, but have lost their identity; their entire society is now reorganized for the sole purpose of revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Brogy and Dorry, two giants on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> island of Little Garden, have been fighting one another for one hundred years when the Straw Hats meet them. They casually admit to having forgotten the original reason (which of their hunted prey was bigger) and fight purely for the sake of honor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet">Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet</a></em>: The interstellar war between the Galactic Alliance of Humanity and the Hideauze. The original cause and reason for the war is known only to top officials in the Galactic Alliance, and they have been fighting a Total War against the Hideauze for so long that many of them see "kill the Hideauze" as their sole reason for being. When one soldier is questioned as to what he'd do if they ever won the war, he's completely at a loss. As for the Hideauze, we never see the war from their perspective, so it's unknown if they have a similar outlook on it, but the fact that they've never attempted peace (as far as we know) says something.
<ul><li> Ledo, a Galactic Alliance soldier who got separated from his fleet when they were escaping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> being dished out by the Hideauze in the first episode, eventually finds out there are Hideauze living in Earth's oceans. He's determined to wipe them out at all costs, and ends up abandoning a lot of his friends on Gargantia to do battle with them. Then finds out a shocking revelation in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a> about his foe in episode 9. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the Hideauze were genetically modified humans, who were originally known as the Evolvers, and wanted to modify humans to survive in space to escape an increasingly freezing and hostile to humans Earth. Meanwhile, the precursor to the Galactic Alliance, the Continental Union, wanted to go into space too, but they wanted humans to stay humans. Both groups were fundamentally opposed to each other, and in space, turned into the Forever War that Ledo was taught about. Meanwhile back on Earth, all the ice seems to have melted away, and the humans remaining there forgot about the Evolvers, and the Earth Hideauze gradually morphed into the "whale-squid" that humans revere and try to leave alone.</span> He doesn't take this revelation too well, as it contradicts everything he had been taught and trained for all of his life.

</li><li> The <em>Cannon Fodder</em> short in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories">Memories</a></em>. In a walled city perpetually at war, everyone's lives and livelihood depend upon maintaining and firing the enormous cannons that make up most of the city. Nearly every building in the city is equipped with a cannon of varying size, able to fire huge artillery shells over the city walls. Though the story is centered around a young boy and his father, who works as a lowly cannon-loader, the film is dedicated to the lives of the anonymous citizens of the city who slave to fuel and maintain this parody of the twentieth century war machine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of the shells land in the desert surrounding the city. There is no enemy.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em> It is implied that Deunan thought she was fighting one of these before being brought to Olympus.
<div class="indent">"You mean the war's been over?" <br/>"For years."
</div></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Long War</a> between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Alliance of Free Planets</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Galactic Empire</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> is centuries old, and much older than any cast member alive at the beginning of the series, going on for exactly <em>158 years, nine months and 21 days</em> before it ended (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">and it would have continued had one Imperial officer not acted on her own or another arrived at the right place just a little later</a>). It's explained that it's spent a lot of that time being a cold war in stalemate, mostly involving border skirmishes.
<ul><li> And to further the trope, the only people who remember the reason of the war (workers fleeing an at-the-time oppressive state and refusing to come back) are historians.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVOTOMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVOTOMS">Armored Trooper VOTOMS</a></em> uses this trope as there was a century old war between Gilgamesh and Balarant, provoked by the presence of the Overman who are effectively immortal beings with Chirico being the most notable one.
</li><li> A sort of one-sided example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. While it's obvious why the humans are fighting the Titans — they don't want to get eaten — it's not clear what the Titans are, where they came from, or why they eat people. So their motives, if they're even intelligent enough to have any, are completely unknown, and so the struggle continues.
<ul><li> More of a straight example with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marley vs. Eldia</span> conflict. Both sides have been locked in a power struggle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for at least 2000 years, and all the expansionist fascist Marley tells Eldians is that it's Eldia's fault for being the descendents of expansionist tyrants and that they're all paying for their ancestors' sins, whatever those are.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paradis Island</span> has completely forgotten that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's even involved in this war, but that was intentional and the people of the walls have been indoctrinated and brainwashed to forget the war and the rest of the world.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren attempts to end the war in the most horrifying way possible; by murdering most of the world and enslaving the survivors on Paradis Island. His supporters believe this will make the world 'smaller and manageable', even if the war continues.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>: The war between Athena and other Gods, especially Hades have been going for aeons. Just recently the war with Hades is permanently end but as the manga still continue there are other Gods and war the main characters have to face.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SoImASpiderSoWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SoImASpiderSoWhat">So I'm a Spider, So What?</a></em> the Humans and Demons are in a perpetual state of war, varying from open conflict to cold war. The war died down after the last Hero and Demon King died due to both sides being exhausted but kicks up again due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiraori needing to sacrifice enough people to prevent the end of the world</span>.

Humans and the "demon" races have been fighting, killing and enslaving each other for so long nobody knows when it started or why, and the grudges are too far entrenched for either side to lay down their arms and enter peace talks. "God" has grown sick of it and brought in the protagonist, dropped him and his dungeon right in the middle of the land bridge the armies would need to stop and charged him with building a blockade to make further fighting impossible. So far, Amdusias is doing a pretty damn good job at his assigned task, bringing the hope for peace for the first, possibly ever.

As such the whole setting is plagued by non stop warfare with no side really winning.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, two galaxy-level empires, The Kree and The Skrull, have been at war for approximately one million years. While the cause <em>is</em> known — The Skrulls offered to share their technology with the Kree if they passed a test, but when they failed (and compounded their failure by killing the Cotati, the pacifist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens">Plant Aliens</a> who had passed the test), the Kree killed the Skrull envoys and stole the technology anyway — it doesn't matter anymore. Both races just wish the other dead, and in at least the Skrulls' case, their warlike tendencies have become hereditary (as in, in their genes). The rivalry was first established in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKreeSkrullWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKreeSkrullWar">The Kree/Skrull War</a>. The Kree fight because they are Space Nazis who kill anyone non-Kree for "polluting the gene pool" (despite the fact the Kree themselves are canonically established as being a genetic dead end).
<ul><li> This rivalry extends to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, but between the Kree and the Chitauri.

One bright spark comes up with an idea to "fix" the upset by genetically engineering two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier">Child Soldiers</a>, one Kree and one Skrull, each imbued with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a> of their race's entire history of war, and forcing them to fight endless gladiatorial bouts as a proxy for the war that people can bet on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">It actually works.</a> At least, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> arrive and take offense to the idea.

At this point in the present, Megatron reveals that he doesn't care about the reasons they fight and merely says that he will kill the last Autobot and anyone in his way, not only to achieve his goal, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">because he'd like it</a>.

While the former delves into the political fallout, one issue of the latter shows a group of ragtag Decepticon scavengers utterly baffled by the idea. The war has gone on for as long as they can remember, and they can't really grasp the reality of it ending. They also have absolutely no clue what to do about it. Eventually they decide to just say screw it, head back to Cybertron, and hope for the best when they get there.

<ul><li> The Evronians are in this state, always invading worlds and draining their population of emotions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">They have a good reason for this</a>: they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eaters</a> that at some point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">started powering their technology with emotions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">only to realize that they had to drain sentients en-masse to feed themselves and maintain their technology</a>, and are trapped in a vicious circle.

</li><li> Once upon a time the Coronians, led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Moldrock</a> and his Horde, were in such a state, always invading other worlds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">to sate their leaders' thirst for combat</a>.

More accurately it was a series of wars initiated by a renegade Jedi Master who declared himself a Sith Lord (Darth Ruin) and waged war on the Republic, and when he was assassinated by his followers a succession of other Sith with their own agendas rose and fell over the centuries to terrorise the galaxy, gradually de-stablising the Republic until the war climaxed with the destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness- a cult that united various Sith Lords under yet another fallen Jedi Master (Lord Kaan)- by the Sith Lord Darth Bane, who decided that the Sith should operate in the shadows from hereon in, and as it was Bane's order that Palaptine belonged to when he destroyed the Jedi and took over the galaxy one could argue that even the millennia of peace that followed the New Sith Wars was just a lull in the fighting as the Sith changed strategy rather than a true end to the conflict.

But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time." "Has this one been going on long, Buck?" "Well, I should RECKON! It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along there. There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do, of course. Anybody would." "What was the trouble about, Buck?land?" "I reckon maybeI don't know." "Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?" "Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago." "Don't anybody know?" "Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place."

In contrast to the conflicts between Alerans and the Marat and the Canim (which are only intermittent and have a definite purpose of gaining territory, slaves or vengeance for a particular incident) the war with the Icemen has been continuous for generations, with nothing whatsoever gained by either side. The destructive pointlessness of this war for both sides means that Isana of Alera and Sunset of the Icemen are both cautiously eager to broker a ceasefire, but unfortunately the war has caused so much resentment and prejudice on both sides that the other Alerans actively try to sabotage any resolution, on the grounds that the other side are monsters and cannot possibly be reasoned with. Efforts to point out that nobody has actually <em>tried</em> to negotiate fall on deaf ears until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Isana provokes the Aleran general into nearly killing her in a duel (where both sides can see the result and understand her commitment to the cause) and uses his own shock and guilt to break through his prejudice enough to talk with Sunset, who uses the duel to convince the Icemen that not all Alerans are hopeless killers.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The closest thing the war actually has to a cause seems to be the interaction between Aleran fire-magic (which the soldiers used constantly to stay warm) and the water-magic-based telepathy of the Icemen.

Since this happens every time Alerans and Icemen are in proximity, a tense first meeting quickly turned into the above Forever War.</span>

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TerokNor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TerokNor">Terok Nor</a></em> novels, part of what motivates Cardassian support for withdrawing from their Occupation of Bajor is the idea that, if the 50-year occupation goes on much longer, both sides will be too emotionally invested in it to ever stop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRomulanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRomulanWay">The Romulan Way</a></em>, Vulcan before Surak. It's said that, between the birth of civilization on Earth at <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the battle of the Thermopylae, there had been only a period of 10 standard years in which as much as ten percent of Vulcan was <em>not</em> at war. In fact, the only thing that stopped the wars was first contact with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill">alien pirates faking peaceful intentions</a>, and war resumed soon after, first against the pirates and then (after the pirates were defeated) between each other until Surak managed to establish his reformations.
<ul><li> Amazingly enough, <em>the Rihannsu (future Romulans) weren't involved in the last inter-Vulcan wars</em>: their leader S'task, noticing that Surak's teachings were taking hold in the population and he was the main obstacle, took with himself his followers and left to try and avoid a war that could destroy Vulcan for good, and actually used the enormous planet-wide financial effort to build the colony ships to prevent the old wars from resuming while Surak spread his reformations. It failed, with the wars resuming soon after their departure and Surak himself being killed, but at least they tried.
</li><li> The Rihannsu being very similar to pre-Reformation Vulcans, they got back into this state soon after settling. Rihannsu being Rihannsu, they quickly settled into mostly-ceremonial wars, nowhere as violent as the ones back on Vulcan, until a passing Federation ship sent them first contact information and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill">remembering what happened with the pirates back on Vulcan, ceased their wars and blew up the next Federation ship that tried to contact them</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> The war between the Jedi and the Sith, and the various Republics and Empires associated with them, has been going on for some 24,000 years, beginning with the Dark Jedi splitting off from the Jedi. Even though there have been various long periods where one side has been in hiding, the war has been going ever since. And it doesn't show any signs of ever reaching an end.
<ul><li> One of the wars during the Old Republic period against a faction of Sith lasted for a thousand years. The Sith actually succeeded in taking most of the Republic's territory except for the Core Worlds. It got so bad for the good guys that it was even called the Republic Dark Age because they were basically reduced to a besieged rump state. Eventually the Jedi and Republic forces managed to turn the tide and start taking back the galaxy (it helps that the Sith tend to fight each other as much as the Jedi), and eventually won the war. Unfortunately, they failed to detect one last Sith remaining, and this eventually produced the "Rule of Two" Sith order featured in the movies, which used stealth, manipulation, and complex plots instead of armies to fight the Jedi. And anyone who has seen the movies knows how this turns out.
</li><li> Further back in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline (7,000 years before the movies to be exact) we have a war that was simply referred to as "The Hundred Year Darkness", because it lasted for... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">well, take a guess</a>. The losing side eventually founded the original Sith Empire.

</li><li> Likewise the war on Nim Drovis between the Drovians and Gopso'o (seen briefly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy">Planet of Twilight</a></em>). The most common theory is that the war started with an argument over the meaning of the word "truth", but the combatants don't really care anymore; the war now contains elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>.

At Aharietiam, humanity finally won, and the Heralds ascended to the Tranquiline Halls to continue the fight there, to reclaim Heaven from the Voidbringers. The truth, however, is that humanity <em>didn't</em> win. The Heralds were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">so tired of fighting that they gave up and left</a>. It turns out that part of the cycle was the Heralds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">traveling to Damnation willingly or by dying and being tortured. Each new desolation started after one of the Heralds couldn't take it any longer and gave up to escape. During the final Desolation they realized that was the only Talenel had never been the one to break and was the only Herald to have died this time.</span> They told the people they won, and the world gained a four and a half thousand year reprieve from the Desolations <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as Talenel shouldered the burden of holding back the Voidbringers alone.</span> But as the series begins, people slowly begin to realize that the war never ended, and the Voidbringers are returning once more.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer">Oathbringer</a></em> expands on it further, showing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the war actually started when the humans were forced to abandon their home planet. The native Rosharans (called singers) took them in, but humanity betrayed them, beginning the war. Originally the term Voidbringers was the name the singers had given the humans who had come from another planet to settle on theirs.</span>
</li><li> The War of Reckoning is the beginnings of one: the Alethi highprinces declared war on the Parshendi to avenge the assassination of their king, realized that the Chasmfiends in Parshendi lands contain precious magical resources, and turned the entire war effort into a Chasmfiend hunting competition. Six years on, the war camps are the new <em>de facto</em> capital while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen</a> drives Alethkar into civil unrest.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> It's eventually revealed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeBodyProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeBodyProblem">The Three-Body Problem</a></em> trilogy that this is the default state of the universe, due to the Dark Forest phenomenon. When one alien civilization discovers another alien civilization, neither can be certain that the other is not a threat. Even if the language barrier gets crossed, a friendly appearance can be used to conceal hostile intentions, and furthermore they are, by simply existing, competing for vital resources. Given this uncertainty, the safest thing for any given Civilization A to do if it discovers any given Civilization B is to immediately destroy them before the reverse happens. To quote the book:
<div class="indent">The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life  another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod  theres only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. Its the explanation for the Fermi Paradox.
</div></li><li> A large part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Thursday Next</a></em> series of books is the hundred and fifty year old war between British and Russian forces over the Crimean Peninsula. Many important people believe giving it up would be a disservice to those who died on it. Few recognize the landmass is a bombed out hellhole worth nothing.

It does help that both the protagonists and antagonists contain immortal characters (Elves on the side of good, various wraiths, balrogs, dragons and other miscellaneous creepy-crawlies on team evil). For the first humans without extended lifespans though, it would certainly seem as such, as they entered the world in the midst of a conflict. They couldn't hope to understand.

(Though the fact that they live within the sphere of influence of the elemental Fegrim may have something to do with it.) The war finally fades and dies with the passing of Kanish-Kulya from Chaos into Time.

Fortunately, Brion and his ghostly allies are able to finally bring the war to an end.

The Shadows ask everyone, "What do you want?", but don't know the answer to the question themselves any more. The Vorlons ask, "Who are you?", but likewise have forgotten their answer. When their respective noses are rubbed in this fact, they rather shamefacedly agree to leave the galaxy forever and let the younger races decide their own course.

<ul><li> The long-running conflict between the Thals and the Kaleds on the planet Skaro. It ran for so long, that technology in the war started to run backwards; one soldier was found with a laser and a musket, wearing a radiation detector and a gas mask. The conflict was only brought to an end when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> was placed in charge of peace negotiations. Which kinda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks">started a whole bunch of new conflicts</a>.
</li><li> The eternal war between the Sontarans and the Rutans, which gets mentioned each time either race appears in the series. It was stated to have been going on for <em>50,000 years</em> as of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky">"The Poison Sky"</a>, and was still going on in the serial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E3TheSontaranExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E3TheSontaranExperiment">"The Sontaran Experiment"</a>, set 14,000 years <em>after that</em>.
</li><li> The war between Atrios and Zeos in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E6TheArmageddonFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E6TheArmageddonFactor">"The Armageddon Factor"</a>.

The Daleks and the Movellans (both robotic species) cannot commit to an attack if they do not have an advantage, but since their tactical computers are too evenly matched, neither can attain an advantage long enough to do so. The episode centers around both side's efforts to find a way to end the stalemate. The Doctor even comments that their endlessly maneuvering for position without ever actually firing a shot is actually a peculiar form of peace. He ultimately decides to deny his solution to their problem to both sides so that they will continue endlessly seeking an opening against each other without bothering the rest of the galaxy.
</li><li> For that matter, the Time War itself counts, as both sides can travel through time causing it to be waged across time itself  hence the name. The Time Lords even concluded that the only way to end the war would be to end time itself, which <em>did not</em> sit well with the Doctor. Additionally, Dalek/Time Lord hostilities and smaller skirmishes go back long before the war itself. Furthermore, since the Doctor and a number of Daleks managed to escape the time lock, which almost got broken once and might still cause the return of the time war, the surviving Daleks and the Doctor are still continuing the conflict. As of the end of season 35 (ninth of the relaunched series) both are back, but are shadows of their former power and can't continue the war directly.

The answer: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy">because their system has declared Kirk and his crew as casualties without knowing that a Federation capital ship can bomb a planet back to stone-age in a matter of hours and their own weapons are worthless against such a ship</a>.

In Khornes case, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a> who is greatly strengthened by all conflict so a war that never ends would assure his supremacy.

Orks were made to wage war, and they gleefully do so on anyone who happens to get in their way, other Orks included. Why? Because it's fun.

The only real survivors of the conflict are the military. No matter the outcome, the game takes place in the final days of the war; only two Commanders are left, and both sides have forgotten the technology to build more or to open new gates between worlds. Both campaigns are a last-ditch effort on the part of each Commander to bring the fight to the other one and <em>finally</em> end it all. To quote the intro:
<div class="indent">"What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other."

<ul><li> Though this is constantly cited as a real-life example, it would be generous to claim the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has cohesive roots older than 150 years. Granted, this is still at least twice as long as the lifespan of the average person.
</li><li> The first Arab-Israeli war started in 1948, mere hours after the founding of the State of Israel.
<ul><li> There were riots, raids and skirmishes before that and the Jews took the British side in the 1930s Arab Revolt because of said troubles.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sudan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sudan">Sudan</a> experienced a civil war literally <em>before</em> the country even declared independence. That war, which lasted from 1955 to 1972, then 1983 to <em>2005</em>, eventually ended up with the birth of a new country: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthSudan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthSudan">South Sudan</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">Which, unsurprisingly, ended up with a civil war on their own</a> that continues today.

</li><li> The people of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> have been continuously at war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. It has been going for so long, with record casualties on <em>every</em> side that's fighting on, that it's a wonder why foreign invaders decide on conquering what is basically a mountain fortress with little natural resources as their prize. Every time you think about it, it's rather depressing.
<ul><li> Because Afghanistan's population is very young, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in the country. Over 70% of the population were born after the Soviet invasion, which means they have been experiencing nothing but war all their lives. And with how the war is dragging by the year, that percentage is growing.
</li><li> To give you a rundown: the last king was deposed and replaced by his Soviet-leaning cousin in 1973. Everything seemed fine for several years, until said cousin went increasingly astray from the Soviets and eventually assassinated by a rival communist group in 1978. Then the civil war began, prompting the Soviets to invade the country and try to restore order. The Americans funded a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Mosque Militant</a> in a neighboring country and sent them to whack the Soviets, forcing them to leave the war in stalemate in 1989. The civil war kept going, this time between the Mosque Militant (now on its way to become a proper army) and their rivals. The former won (although what little territory outside of their hands continued to experience war) and managed to salvage some peace, at the cost of regressing the rights of people (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">especially</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">women</a>). Then a certain event happened on 11 September 2001, which followed the assassination of the militant's biggest rival. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The Americans invaded</a>, dismantled the militant group, and installed their own puppets, but the militants regrouped and started doing the insurgency. Said insurgency is still happening today.
</li><li> There's a reason why it's known as the "Graveyard of Empires". For centuries, foreign powers have fought over the territory due to its strategic value as a buffer against potential invasion, as well as a gateway connecting the Middle East with Asia. No foreign invaders since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> has actually managed to take <em>and</em> hold Afghanistan, and seeing as Alexander died rather young it's unknown whether even he could've maintained control.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Somalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Somalia">Somalia</a> has been at war since 1986, after 31 years, Somalia has seen many territorial changes, numerous different rebel groups, radical religious militants, a country trying to become independent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Somaliland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Somaliland">Somaliland</a>), 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">United Nations</a> Peacekeeping missions and at least 3 different Somali governments. And the war is expected to keep going since the new government is still very weak and prone to instability (Since most it's support is done by the UN and the military forces of the African Union) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfricanTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfricanTerrorists">Al-Shabaab</a> is still very active and strong showing no signs of wanting to surrender or negotiate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> has no clear end and could potentially go on for decades. Or at least until Terror is no longer used as a tactic.

They had been fighting for over 120 years, and no one on either side could remember what it was about. It only ended when both asked the Prophet Muhammad to settle their differences.
</li><li> The Hundred Years' War between England and France, which lasted 116 years (including some armistices). Given the average lifespans and literacy rates at that point, it's very likely most people had no idea what the war was about.
<ul><li> It was (originally) a dispute over royal authority: King Edward III of England refused to subordinate himself to King Philip VI of France, as previous kings of England dating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfNormandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfNormandy">William the Conqueror</a> had done (as they held lands in France as French nobles independently of their lands in England). Philip VI responded by confiscating Edward III's property in France. Edward III then declared that Philip VI had no authority to do so, because <em>he</em> was actually the rightful king of France (Edward was more closely related to the previous king than Philip, but the crown was given to Philip because he was related through the male line while Edward was related to Charles IV through his mother). Accusing the king of being a usurper is obviously a big deal, so naturally war resulted. Given that the kings of England at the time were also French nobility, it could rightly be seen as a French civil war. But unlike most succession disputes, this war continued long after the original claimants to the throne were dead. England and France each had five different kings over the course of the war.
</li><li> Even after the war ended (1453), relations between France and England were far from peachy. Both countries would remain at odds for the next four hundred years over matters such as religion or colonial ambition. In fact, it wasn't until the Crimean War (1853) that either of them actually managed to agree on anything.
<ul><li> Not strictly true, as there was a brief period, during what some historians have dubbed the 'Second Hundred Years War' (between the ascension to the throne of William and Mary in 1688 and Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo in 1815), between 1716 - 1731 that the Anglo-French Alliance existed and they even fought alongside each other (uniquely in this time period) during the 1718- 1720 'War of the Quadruple Alliance' (with the titular Alliance comprising them, (the then State of the Holy Roman Empire) Austria and the Dutch Republic, later joined by Savoy) against the Kingdom of Spain.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Likewise the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years_War">80 years war<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or the Dutch War for independence (actual duration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">68 years</a>) ended in 1648. Likewise in the example above, lifespans were not that long back then, and even still; it lasted nearly a century in total until peace was obtained. Lives started and ended in a constant struggle.
<ul><li> Notably, the reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Non-Indicative Name</a> is that the war spanned 80 years, but was interrupted by a period in the middle known as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Years%27_Truce">Twelve Years Truce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. War became so much the default that it became necessary to name the period of peace.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, Persia's invasion of Greece was kind of like this... for the Persians. The Greeks knew <em>exactly</em> what they wanted out of it (that is, not to become a Persian province), but Xerxes wasn't entirely sure what he was doing there: Greece was a resource-poor and somewhat backwards excuse for a civilization, and the Greeks already in his empire (in Ionia, what is now western Turkey) had proven to be ungovernable. The only reason the Persians even <em>thought</em> about conquering mainland Greece was a peculiar battle in which an Athenian army assisted Miletos (a Greek city in Ionia) in reasserting its independence; in the process, they managed to torch the Persian provincial capital at Sardis. This made Xerxes' father Darius (who was Shah at the time) VERY angry once he got over his confusion (Athens was a tin-pot town nobody important had ever heard of). Darius shot an arrow into the sky, and swore "O God, grant that I may punish the Athenians;" later on, he had a servant remind him of his pledge at dinner daily, and various plans for fighting the Athenians were drawn up. Xerxes was not so preoccupied, and was rather confused with Darius' request that he also try to "punish the Athenians;" supposedly, the only thing that convinced Xerxes to go at all was a recurring dream of a phantom telling him to go to Greece.
<ul><li> A recent interpretation that's gaining a lot of credibility that, since the Persian Empire was run on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Tarkin Doctrine</a>, an Emperor had to be seen as living up to the exploits of his forefathers (remember, Xerxes is only the 4th Persian Emperor). This means conquest- and, for Darius and Xerxes, Greece is about the only thing left that's easy to conquer. Or at least they had every reason to expect it to be easy.
</li><li> It also qualifies as "forever" because it raged on and off for about 160 years until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> finally toppled the Persian Empire.
<ul><li> Heck, Alexander's conquest only put a brief pause to the conflict. One thousand years later, Greeks and Persians were <em>still</em> fighting each other. Which is known as...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The group of conflicts collectively known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Persian_Wars">Roman-Persian Wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, more than seven centuries of on-and-off conflicts, which was only ended when the Muslims overwhelmed the Sassanids. Therein followed another four or so centuries of conflict <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine-Arab_Wars">with the Arabs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, two-and-a-half <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine-Seljuk_wars">with the Turks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and then another two-and-a-bit <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93Ottoman_wars">with the Ottomans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Bizarre sort-of-well-not-really examples: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_extended_by_diplomatic_irregularity">Various wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have lasted a long time because people forgot the war was officially still going on or because the drafters of the original peace treaty forgot to include a belligerent nation. The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hundred_and_Thirty_Five_Years%27_War">Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is notable for having no casualties, with no shots fired.
<ul><li> More bizarre on the list linked above: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">The Third Punic War</a> ended with the legions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> sacking Carthage, taking its population as slaves and allegedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth">salting the fields</a> in 146 BC. Since the Carthaginian state was destroyed, the war only officially ended when the mayors of Rome and Carthage (Tunis, nowadays) signed a ritual peace treaty in 1985, over twenty-one centuries later.
</li></ul></li><li> Inversion: The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zanzibar_War">Anglo-Zanzibar war<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lasted somewhere between 33 and 45 minutes.
</li><li> It's not a perfect example but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar">Thirty Years' War</a> continued to be fought after the initial cause of the war had been resolved (mostly because it became a convenient excuse for other nations to advance their political goals.)
<ul><li> It was the longest war that was one of continual fighting. Nearly every example listed here is a series of conflicts.
</li></ul></li><li> The conflict between the Sinhalese-dominated government Sri Lanka and the Tamil separatists seemed to be this, going on for 25 years with no apparent end in sight, until the Tamil Tigers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">suddenly annihilated</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/sri-lankas-killing-fields/4od">alongside a lot of Tamil civilians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 2009.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> was expected to last forever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">until it suddenly ended in 1990.</a>
<ul><li> The Cold War itself was a direct product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WW2</a>, which in itself was a direct product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WW1</a>, which was a direct product of, among others, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar">Franco-Prussian War</a>, the cause of which can be traced back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustroPrussianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustroPrussianWar">Austro-Prussian War</a>, which was inspired by the aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>, which stemmed from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution">French Revolution</a>, which was inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>, which came to be after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a>, which was provoked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, et cetera, et cetera. That's not even covering all the countless smaller and more indirect wars and side conflicts that contributed to this state. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> is a direct result of the Cold War (and, for that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WW1</a>), the chain goes on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, lasted from 1955 to 1975 and was itself the continuation of the war the French fought back when the area was called French Indochina... which was in turn a continuation of the war against the Japanese when they occupied French Indochina, which was in turn a continuation of the various conflicts in Indochina between the French and those seeking to evict them since the Annamese war... It goes on.
</li><li> It continued with the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the Sino-Vietnamese War, which didn't completely fizzle out until <em>1990</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, most, if not all, "Wars" against intangible concepts. Like the above mentioned War on Terror, the War on Drugs and War on Poverty have shown no sign of progress. A famous article from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a></em> even satirizes this with the headline <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/assets/news/2013/onion-drugs.pdf">Drugs Win Drug War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, showing the inevitable failure against these sort of "Wars".
<ul><li> It must be noted however that the reason for the failure to end these wars mostly stems out of the fact that they are not meant to be <em>won</em>, but are fought because not doing so would lead to each of these concepts (Terror, Drugs, Poverty, Crime, Corruption, etc) to spiral out of control and cause an uncontrolable crisis within the country.
</li></ul></li><li> After the USA "won" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar">the first Gulf War</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq">Iraq</a> in 1991, they continued to bomb the country to enforce the no-fly zone at least once a week until the 2003 invasion. The USA formally withdrew in 2011, but the country experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring">a new bout of violence</a> that didn't stop until 2017. Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s hideous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar">8-year war with Iran</a> and his genocidal suppression of the Kurds in Al-Anfal, until 2017, Iraq had known only two years of peace since he came to power in 1979. Thankfully, unlike Afghanistan, a happy ending was eventually reached by Iraqis (although the USA's confrontation with Iran might complicate matters).
</li><li> For large portions of history we didn't even bother to <em>name</em> our wars. War was the normal state of being except in the core of large states. In other words the only places where there was peace was where one faction had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomped</a> everyone else in the area.
<ul><li> According to a UN statistic published in 2000 in the 100 years of the 20th Century there have been roughly 5 minutes of world peace. The rest of the time there was a war being fought somewhere on Earth. Despite that, however, it was actually <em>less</em> violent than any previous century going by percentage of population lost.
</li><li> In the entirety of recorded history, there has been (officially) approximately 250 years of peace. In reality, there would have been unofficial violent conflicts between various groups for most of that time, and smaller-scale conflicts for longer.
</li></ul></li><li> According to Kevin Phillip's <em>The Cousin's Wars</em>, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">every</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanoverStuartWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanoverStuartWars">single</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">civil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">war</a> among English speakers since the seventeenth century the same ethnic and religious groups predictably lined up on opposite sides with the same allies and enemies they had before so that one could predict the line up for the next by the previous. This applies even to elections, which are sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonlethalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonlethalWarfare">nonlethal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>: began in 1455 over a dispute in the succession dating back to 1399 and ended in 1485. The man who won the war and became king wasn't even born yet when it began.
</li><li> The history of Europe and the Middle East from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">the Roman Civil War of 69 AD</a> until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">the Napoleonic Wars</a> has been <em>one uninterrupted series of wars</em>. Factions changed, often new players invaded from nowhere, but the relevant fact is that Europe and the surrounding area were at war for <em>one thousand, seven hundred and forty-six years straight</em>, with the wars sometimes spilling in more distant areas (the Seven Years War had battlefields in North America and India, and the French Revolution Wars and Napoleonic Wars were also fought in Central and South America and India, and the British war effort was one of the causes of the War of 1812). Then, after the last round nearly destroyed every single faction, the current combatants settled down and tried to establish a peaceful world order, so Europe went at peace... For five years, after which Spanish, Portuguese and Italian liberals start rising to obtain constitutions (and Italian unification) and Greek rebels start preparing the Greek War of Independence that will erupt in 1821, thus starting the series of wars that will end in 1945 with the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a></em>. And in those five years, Spain was <em>still</em> dealing with the independence wars in its colonial empire sparked by Napoleon's invasion.
<ul><li> We could say that, in spite of its name, the Cold War caused the longest period of peace in Europe since 69 AD, lasting from 1945 to 1991 (the Yugoslav Wars), a whopping <em>forty-six years</em> without armed conflict on European soil (though there was still European involvement in some of the wars outside the continent).
</li><li> For an incomplete summary, listen to the song <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc56moy0poA">Europa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, and keep in mind that it's watered down for lack of time. If there's one thing in this world you can guarantee, Europeans will always default to kicking the hell out of each other.
</li><li> With that in mind, the European Union being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 makes a small measure of sense. The Warsaw Pact and NATO alliances were largely responsible for the status quo following World War II, where none of their members have fought one another since 1945, and those members have include Britain, France, Germany, Poland, and Russia between them responsible for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> entries on this page (especially Germany, which prior to unification was in a state of eternal civil war). The expansion of NATO and its civilian component, the EU, to encompass most ex-Warsaw Pact countries as well has continued the peace maintained since then. The reduction of the average level of strife between non-Yugoslav European countries to passive-aggressive sniping is nothing short of astonishing.
</li></ul></li><li> The Balkans are more or less in a perpetual state of unrest. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1632</a></em> novels lampshade this by saying that, yes, there is a crisis in the Balkans, and had the Ring of Fire taken them three and a half centuries into the future instead of three and a half centuries into the past, there would <em>still</em> be a crisis in the Balkans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, although ending properly in 1865, spawned race conflicts and armed upheavals that lasted for decades. One of the comments made in the Ken Burns documentary stated that it lasts to this very day, as long as race divide is not solved. In short: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> wished for a final end to this problem, and they <em>got</em> a number of amendments to support their cause through in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>. But then the southern democrats dug in, and this issue is still a problem.
<ul><li> The ongoing nature of this conflict is not helped that the two regions have a sizeable political divide, with many of the prominent Northern States being bastions of liberal politics and most of the former Confederate states being bastions of "conservative" (often reactionary) politics.
</li><li> The Hatfield-McCoy feud, which followed almost immediately after the war. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> officially lists it running from 1881-1891, but the initial start of the trouble was from a murder of a Union Soldier in 1865, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">alleged theft of a pig in 1878, and an outstanding bootlegging warrant.</a> During the feud proper, 15 people died. Because issues with state lines involved, it grew to such a problem that it almost sparked a war between Kentucky and West Virginia! The resulting trials of the participants lasted until 1901 (the last one was for the bootlegging).
</li><li> It should be noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> was a forgone conclusion in the minds of many people dating back to the signing of the Constitution. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenBurns">Ken Burns</a> documentary regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> devotes its entire first episode to the backstory of the civil war.
</li></ul></li><li> On a microscopic level, bacteria have been at war with viruses called Bacteriophages for billions of years. These viruses infect specific strains of bacteria for reproductive purposes, with bacteria trying to adapt against it and the phages adapting against their adaptations. This war goes on all around us, on every surface, in every fluid, and even inside of us.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arauco_War">The Arauco War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> waged between the Spanish Empire and the Mapuche people in the Araucanía, Chile in 1536. It lasted nearly three centuries where bloody conflicts were interpolated with periods of peace of variable length. One of the most notable battles was the Disaster of Curalaba where a band of Mapuches ambushed and killed the Spanish governor and his peerage. This kickstarted the Third Great Mapuche Rebellion that culminated in the Destruction of the Seven Cities where all the Spanish settlements founded south of the Bio-Bio River were burned to the ground. The Spanish Crown realized that there are not any amounts of gold and silver worth getting massacred for and decided to establish frontier using the previously mentioned river as a natural barrier. From here on the conflicts continued at irregular intervals during the Chilean War of Independence and the War of the Pacific. It wasn't until the Occupation of the Araucanía in 1883 that the conflict was brought to an end. King Phillip II of Spain compared the Arauco War to the Eighty Years War described above and claimed that more Spaniards died on this conflict alone than any other war in the New World. What's even more, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinadora_Arauco-Malleco">some people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> want to start it back up again.
</li><li> Your immune system fights a war against trillions of invading pathogens on a daily basis, even outside of the notable times your skin is breached and something begins making you feel sick. For example, millions of mold spores invade your lungs every time you take a breath, and would take root and kill you if not for this intervention. Your immune system is constantly on a alert, active, and will continue fighting off these pathogens every moment you're alive.
</li><li> The longest ongoing conflict is the Chechen-Russian conflict which has been going on since <em>1785</em>.
</li><li> The Norman invasion of Wales began in 1067 under William the Conqueror, who percieved the war as unending. Unfortunately, nobody told his son and successor William Rufus that what ensued was something that didn't officially end until Edward Longshanks conquered it, bringing this long conflict to an end in 1283.
