The practice of giving inappropriate firearms to characters or factions in a TV show or movie. They're generally inappropriate because they are either outdated (like modern American soldiers with Tommy guns), too modern for the setting (like a cop in 1965 having a Glock), or because the group in question wouldn't have access to them (like Soviet soldiers wielding Uzis).
<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Needless to say, it isn't restricted to guns, but they are always the first and most notable victim. Which is strange, as it's generally a lot easier to get a few MP-40's than to arrange for a Tiger tank to show up in your production.
</p><p>One reason this can happen (especially for things more expensive than guns) is that the "right" weapon may not be available, and an incorrect version easier to come by than it would be to make a replica. For example, Chinese AK clones commonly stand in for the real thing in American movies made during the Cold War. An extreme case would be armoured vehicles; there is only one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>-vintage Tiger tank that still runs in the <em>entire world</em> and leasing a running mock-up from a private collection would be far more expensive than simply using some other tank and hoping the audience doesn't figure it out. This goes even more for ships; before modern CGI, movies were often forced to either use contemporary warships (even with a stratospheric budget, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor">Pearl Harbor</a></em>'s Japanese carrier set was built on the deck of a modern carrier, made obvious by the visible steam catapult runs) or unconvincing models.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Anime and video games have no similar excuse, since they can by definition include anything the artists can draw or render, no matter how hard it might be to acquire a real example. One of the major reasons (aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and a desire to include the creator's favorite guns no matter how little sense it makes) is that the designers often are not "gun people" and just copy what they saw in movies, or - in an effort to make sure what they do include is modeled as accurately as possible - are limited by what props they can get their hands on to use as a reference, often having to go off of more common stand-ins or airsoft guns.
</p><p>While guns are a fairly mature technology with most new designs being more ergonomic than mechanically different (which seems to boil down to more plastic, short stroke gas piston, and different ergonomics than any actual innovations), some shows will push this and it gets unrealistic when a gun is still in use in an entirely different universe, 1,000,000,000 years from now, or 100 years before it was designed.

<ul><li> The M1911 service pistol (usually the M1911A1 variant specifically), shows up in a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> as the signature gun of characters who have access to <em>vastly</em> higher tech weapons. It's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by being much simpler and potentially more reliable than those other sci-fi weapons (a reasonable extrapolation to make from the real world, where it's already over a hundred years old, pretty outdated in some ways, and yet still in common use even - or perhaps especially - among special forces that have every right or reason to carry more modern kit).
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> novels, Honor notoriously carries one and puts it to great use in the <em>40th century</em>, when more contemporary weapons could easily tear apart a real-word tank. It turns out she's in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Creative_Anachronism">SCA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which by that time practice with gunpowder firearms the same way their modern counterparts practice archery. There are also noted to be several advantages to using a contemporary firearm, such as the fact that the sound of firing one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangBangBANG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangBangBANG">much more intimidating</a> in a universe where people are used to the comparatively quiet "pew pew" of a pulser, and that it's easy to sneak into places because modern weapon scanners only search for a power source which a "chemical burner" like the M1911 simply doesn't have.
</li><li> In John Barnes' <em>Timeline Wars</em>, Mark Strang was previously a 20th century bodyguard with every reason to carry a 1911. He kept it when he got drafted into a time-travelling special forces outfit that gave him a gun, the SHAKK, which could tear apart modern tanks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">from six miles, with two thousand homing rounds it can synthesize from scrap metal</a>. His stated reasons for keeping it are that the SHAKK looks kind of like a chromed super-soaker, whereas the M1911A1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation">is much more obvious about what it does</a>, and that he actually knows how to fix the semi-auto if he breaks it while on a mission.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/M1911_pistol_series#M1911">Here's the IMDFB page for the M1911 series.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> A very common one is use of the wrong AK variant. Sometimes you see Soviet/ex-Soviet soldiers in a reasonably modern setting wielding the original AK or the AKM. In reality, they'd been mostly replaced in Soviet service by the AK-74 (which can be identified by a smaller, less-curved, orange-coloured magazine, as well as a large muzzle brake on the end of the barrel). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LordOfWar">Lord of War</a></em> is an example. Recently, however, 7.62mm AKs, either former mainstays of the AKM line, or more modern AK-10x series, made a resurgence, after combat experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya demonstrated that the lighter bullet of the AK-74 tends to ricochet at the slightest prodding, and is thus unsuitable in forested areas. Thus there can be some unexpected aversion, when a bumbling producer who can't be bothered to do the research <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentallyCorrectWriting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentallyCorrectWriting">gets things right on accident.</a>
<ul><li> In reality, the AK-74 was just starting to make its way to the export market before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">The Great Politics Mess-Up</a>. The <em>vast</em> majority of AK variants in the world are of the AKM variety or the Chinese Type 56 clone, both firing the original 7.62x39mm cartridge.
</li></ul></li><li> Misidentification of pistol caliber in live action TV/movies. Hollywood pretty much standardizes around the 9mm blank, so many firearms identified as .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP will often have a 9mm "stand in." With something like a Glock, which comes in several different calibres and variants that are only really differentiated by tiny letters on the slide identifying the caliber, it's barely even noticeable. With the M1911, a common stand-in has been the Spanish Star Model B, a visually similar 9mm pistol, especially in older movies made before actual 1911s in 9mm existed. Still, visually telling the difference between a 9mm and .45 barrel is very very tough, and made even more because we almost never look straight down them.
</li><li> Substitution of a common firearm variant for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">rare one</a>. Machine pistols such as the Beretta 93R or the Glock 18 generally aren't sold outside of government agencies even if the armsmaster has a Class III permit; the usual solution is to drop a full-auto sear into the semiauto variant. In fairness it's not particularly hard to dress a Beretta up as a 93R, and the only obvious difference between semi and full auto Glocks is the ported barrel which you can only see from above (which not every real Glock 18 even has) and the small fire selector near the back of the slide, so most people aren't going to lose much sleep over doing this. The Joker's Glock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> is one notable example.
</li><li> An interesting case occurs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">on the cover</a> of a collected edition of <em>Paratime</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper">H. Beam Piper</a>. The main character is shown holding a Steyr AUG assault rifle. This supposedly represents a bolt-action rifle which U.S. law-enforcement types in 1948 thought looked unusual and advanced... but <em>not</em> extraordinary or science-fictional.
<ul><li> The Steyr AUG has a long history of appearing in works set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> or even the far future. Even now, its sleek profile looks like something that shouldn't exist quite yet, despite having been around since the late '70s.
</li></ul></li><li> Some productions going for a British feel sometimes use Armscor shotguns since these are marked with the British-sounding name of "Squires Bingham." Armscor/Squires Bingham, though started by expatriate Englishmen, is actually a <em>Filipino</em> manufacturer.
<ul><li> Speaking of British characters and guns, it is important to note that American AR-type rifles in the hands of British soldiers may not be an example of this trope given certain conditions. If the soldiers are members of the SAS or a few other special forces units that do carry both American-made M16s/M4s and the Canadian versions, the C7s/C8s, then it is not an example of this trope. British Army and Territorial Army soldiers using them, however, would be an example of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Another weapon that frequently shows up in odd places and times is the FN P90. Its futuristic looks see it, or weapons that are clearly based on the design, in the hands of plenty of far future armies, despite the weapon itself having been developed in the late 1980s. It also lands in the hands of an inordinate amount of terrorists and mercenaries, despite almost exclusive sales to special forces units, police SWAT-style units and presidential bodyguards.
</li><li> Due to their unique appearance, especially their helical feed magazine which can take up to 100 rounds, Calico firearms have appeared in several sci-fi shows including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IComeInPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IComeInPeace">I Come in Peace</a></em> (aka <em>Dark Angel</em>), the parody <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "Time and Again".
</li><li> Rebarreled M2 machine guns are often used as stand-ins for the Soviet DShK heavy machine gun, especially before the end of the Cold War (when it was just unavailable).
</li><li> The Beretta BM59 was on occasion used as a stand-in for the M14. As the two weapons are both modifications of the M1 Garand, this is rarely noticed.
</li><li> There are so many M3 Grease Guns and Stens captured by the People's Liberation Army in the Chinese civil war and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, hardly any war show in China is filmed without them. Cue dozens of anachronistic shows with M3s appearing before WWII. For really low-budget shows, it is possible for a Type 56 AK to appear in Imperial Japan hands. It's also common for the Type 54 (a copy of the Tokarev TT-33) or Type 64 (Walther PPK) to stand in for other pistols.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>, with a group of high schoolers using realistic guns in detailed fashion. Justified by the setting being a sort of Purgatory where those who know about these weapons can re-create them. Which is hilariously subverted in episode 2 when they pull out a gigantic cannon to use against Angel, and the entire thing blows up in their face since none of them knew the mechanics of an artillery gun. Note though that, mechanically, that cannon is actually <em>much simpler</em> than many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a> that appear in the hands of characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> is set in a future with space gates, large spaceships and advanced almost-sentient computers, yet every personal weapon seen is either very similar or exactly identical to present-day ones. Spike himself uses a Jericho 941 (entered production in 1990), Jet a Walther P99 (1997) and Faye a Glock 30 (also 1997). The anime tries to convey the idea that it's set in a somewhat realistic and retro future, so it makes sense that there are no blasters and that energy weapons are few and far between and too large for anything other than ship-based mountings (though it's never explained why Spike has a plasma cannon on his Swordfish II, when even police fighters are restricted to machine guns). You'd think personal firearms would have evolved at least <em>a little</em>. Plenty of the weapons shown in the series were out of date even when it first started in 1998. But then again, everything in <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> is retro, and the setting is semi-post-apocalyptic, so it may be supposed that the development of firearms stalled while humanity expanded into space.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that Spike's dated Jericho can fire in the vacuum of space. The pistol might be mundane, but the bullets are better than what you can buy today.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19qx2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19qx2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19qx2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bullet propellants usually contain all that's needed for combustion, meaning that normal guns should be able to fire in the airless environment of space. However, there's also nothing to radiate the heat away from the gun. So, while the gun can probably get off a few shots it would quickly overheat, causing the barrel and other parts of the gun to expand, rendering the moving parts unable to move. Also, exposure to hard vacuum can cause many types of non-specialized lubrication to flash-evaporate, meaning the gun might not even fire in the first place. Space is <em>not</em> a good place to use most regular firearms.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gankutsuou">Gankutsuou</a></em>, which takes place in the 50th century, Danglars uses a gold-plated PPK/S, and Morcerf a gold-plated P08.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is rather strange in this regard. Taking place in an alternate timeline supposedly equivalent to the real 1960's, most of the firearms seen are fictional, but the few identifiable ones seem like very odd choices in the context of the series. The standard Britannian pistol appears to be a slightly modified Heckler &amp; Koch USP45 or Mark 23 pistol, while the service rifle looks like some kind of cross between a FAMAS and an FN P90. Considering that, in-universe, the EU and Britannia are mortal enemies, it makes very little sense for Britannian troops to be using German, French, and Belgian arms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> is somewhat prone to this in part because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">foot soldiers are rarely the focus</a>:

This in spite of the fact that all three of these weapons, the last in particular, are at least a century or two out of date by the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Universal Century time</a>, much less three-quarters of another century into that. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO">MS IGLOO</a></em>, meanwhile, takes Zeon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">Putting on the Reich</a> tendencies to the extreme by straight-up arming their foot soldiers with Lugers and MG 34s, and the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">The Origin</a></em> also has a few modified versions of the MP 40.

CG cutscenes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> game <em>Zeonic Front</em>, meanwhile, show GM Snipers with beam sniper rifles that are straight-up <a class="urllink" href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rgm79g_p01a.jpg">modeled after the PSG1<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> rather than <a class="urllink" href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rgm-79g-sniper-beamrifle.jpg">the more blocky rifles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> they have in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> Most of the guns in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> franchise are based on real-world weapons, some of which are outdated today (even though the series takes place circa 2030 A.D.) and are frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a> as well. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">FN P90</a> seems to be particularly popular with the creators, as half the guns in the franchise are at least partially based on it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> gives Mirielle a modern Walther P99, which averts this. This trope is played straight with Kirika's Beretta Md. 1934. Instead of giving her the more widely available Walther PPK (which uses the same cartridge and is almost exactly the same size), the production staff deliberately gave her an out-of-production World War 2 vintage pistol because they didn't want to give her "the James Bond gun".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> is an heavy offender, with Marco's Steyr GB pistol, Henrietta's Walther WA 2000 sniper rifle and Triela's Winchester Model 1897 trench gun being quite improper for an assassination team sponsored by the Italian government (and most of them doubling as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a> to boot). Henrietta's WA 2000 is the only one of those that's appropriate <em>at all</em> for an assassin, except that no assassin is likely to have access to them because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">there's less than 200 of them and they're all in private collections</a>, while Triela's shotgun gets a pass on being a somewhat diffuse war residuate and a personal choice of hers (they <em>have</em> tried to make her switch to something else, but she refuses).
<ul><li> Averted by Petra's SITES Spectre submachine gun: while also a rare gun, it's <em>exactly</em> the appropriate weapon, being actual Italian special forces hardware used to bring instant firepower at close range.
</li><li> In another episode one of the girls' minders appeared to be carrying a Filipino Floro SMG, which is an odd choice given that it is only locally used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> since attempts at foreign sales all failed.

While the Luger may be justifiable, as while the main production run ended in 1942 a few smaller production runs were made until 1986 (and total production was a few million) and the ammo abounds, the Nambu ended production in 1945 (and was always scarcer than the Luger, at less than half a million produced) and the ammunition is extremely difficult to find.

<ul><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hicks carries as a backup an Ithaca 'Stakeout' shotgun, and the Marines' sidearm, the VP 70, is a real, unaltered weapon with a 'futuristic' look. The <em>Sulaco's</em> weapon racks are also filled with unaltered modern weapons; M16s, Colt Commando rifles, and Enfield L85s. Vasquez also uses a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 39 pistol at one point. Alan Dean Foster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hangs a lampshade</a> on the first of these in his novelization, when one of the Marines asks Hicks if he got his shotgun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">from a museum</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Supplemental material</a> for the movie says that Hicks's shotgun is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">family heirloom passed down from his great-great-great-great-great grandfather</a>, who carried it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Bear in mind that the gun props in <em>Aliens</em> look suitably futuristic enough that they actually avert this trope for anyone who's not a firearms expert. The M41A has become iconic in its own right, used as the basis for numerous other sci-fi future guns despite the actual firing parts made up of a Thompson SMG (retired in 1971) and a Remington 870 (first entering production in 1951), with the most modern part being the shell of a SPAS-12 (first produced 1982) around the 870. The various other rifles on the weapon racks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">are not really intended to be paid attention to</a> - they're just to show that the <em>Sulaco</em> has a lot of guns on board.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy">Octopussy</a></em> had a scene with Soviet border guards armed with Steyr AUGs.
</li><li> Odd example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, this is one of the movies where real AK-74s are shown alongside fake ones (both modified AKMs or Type 56s as well as rubber props). Bond himself did get a hold of a real AKS-74U. Oddly, Xenia and Trevelyan are seen with fake ones in some scenes. Likely they didn't have enough of real AK-74s as the movie demanded.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack">Pitch Black</a></em> featured a shortened Armscor M30R6 12ga. shotgun dressed up a little to look futuristic.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo</a></em> movies, you will notice many. Since part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboIII">Rambo III</a></em> was filmed in Israel, the production had access to genuine Soviet hardware captured during the wars with the Soviet-backed neighbours while it was there.
<ul><li> Russian helicopters fitted with western weapons (such as the FN MAG machine guns) and even western helicopters with attachments to make them look like Russian choppers (and made them extremely difficult to fly).
</li><li> ZSU-23 Shilka replica made using an M113 chassis in <em>Rambo 3</em>.
</li><li> AKMs, AKMSUs, or Chinese AK replicas modified (such as adding the muzzle brake) to look like AK-74s and AKS-74s since Hollywood did not have access to those weapons at those times. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Sgt. Kourov</a> in the third film uses one of these dressed-up AKMs mounted with a US-made M203 grenade launcher, instead of a Russian made grenade launcher for the same reasons above. Because the two weapons weren't made for each other, the actors were forced to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/8/84/Rambo3-AKM2034A.jpg">sort-of grip the magazine in an incredibly awkward fashion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to fire the launcher.
</li><li> A fake SVD made from a Valmet with an SVD-style stock in the second movie. The SVD is quite rare in the United States even now, and at the time its look-alike, the Romanian PSL, hadn't been imported either.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>
<ul><li> The main weapon of the German soldiers is the MP 40, despite the movie taking place in 1936. The MP 40 was the MP 38 slightly redesigned to be cheaper to manufacture and a little safer to carry, and the two are visually nearly identical, but still falls 2 years too short (there <em>was</em> a little-known prototype version of the MP 38, the MP 36, which bore a superficial resemblance to the later weapon but it had a wooden body, a slightly tilted magazine housing and was produced in very small numbers). Of course, as the Germans were collecting paranormal technology, they obviously must have acquired a short duration time-machine.
</li><li> Some German officers are armed with Walther P38 pistols, which would not be produced until 1938; only hammerless prototypes of the gun existed in '36, which probably wouldn't be in the hands of regular soldiers.
</li><li> Something more jarring: Near the finale, Indiana Jones threatens the bad guys by aiming at them with a rocket launcher. Ignoring the fact that such weapons didn't even exist at the time (they only came about during the war as a more powerful upgrade from the anti-tank rifles used at the time), said weapon is actually a post-war RPG-2 with several cosmetic addons.
</li><li> Another, smaller goof is that Indy is at one point seen with an Inglis Hi-Power, a Canadian variation of Browning's design that didn't begin production until 1944. Even having the original FN Hi-Power, like he does in the bar shootout,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32y2d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32y2d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32y2d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Indy was originally envisioned as having the Colt 1911 for at least this scene, but as above, since 9mm blanks were more reliable they went with the Hi-Power instead</span> would have been a stretch, since it would have only been in production for a year at best at the time of the film. Moreover, the initial sales were almost all for military contracts <em>and</em> FN had an agreement with Colt at the time to not sell its guns in the United States. So Indy would've needed to meet up with an FN sales agent in Europe and special-order the pistol.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em>Lifepod</em> (the sci-fi remake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <em>Lifeboat</em>) where one character is carrying a 20th century revolver because it will get through spaceport detectors that are looking for contemporary energy weapons.
</li><li> A case of being a bit <em>too</em> accurate is in the movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthProtocol">The Fourth Protocol</a></em>, where the KGB agent played by Pierce Brosnan uses a Soviet Makarov pistol — as an 'illegal' carrying out an operation that must not be linked to his own country (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">setting off a nuke outside a US Air Force base to fake an accident</span>) it's the last weapon he'd use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDestroyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDestroyer">Remo Williams</a></em> had the hero being tracked as he ran through the woods by what was actually the High Power Illuminator Radar. It is the distinctive 'Mickey Mouse ears' system. This is a radar meant to 'spotlight' a target for the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu">Zulu</a></em> had a few examples:
<ul><li> While the production crew acquired plenty of period accurate Martini-Henry rifles, the production used up all of the available blank <em>cartridges</em> for its obsolete caliber. Thus, some extras wound up with anachronistic Lee-Enfield Mk I bolt-action rifles with the telltale magazine removed instead.
</li><li> Also, officers used Webley Mk VI revolvers in lieu of period-accurate (but difficult to procure) Beaumont-Adams revolvers.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em> used several anachronistic guns with cosmetic changes. Dorian Gray used a gilded Luger P08, Captain Nemo used a Tokarev TT-33 pistol with ornate external decorations, his men have equally ornately-decorated Sten Mk II submachine guns, and the antagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> used Uzis, Thompsons, and AK-47s essentially encased in rectangular metal boxes. Given that Nemo by virtue of the source material has anachronistically advanced technology in the form of his submarine, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Professor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Moriarty</a></span>, one is left to presume that in-universe they invented these weapons themselves.
<ul><li> They also used Mark V tanks, which were developed at the very end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> — in 1899!
</li></ul></li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABridgeTooFar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABridgeTooFar">A Bridge Too Far</a></em>, most of the American paratroopers (including their Colonel, played by Elliot Gould) are seen carrying the M1 carbine, rather than the modified M1A1 carbine (a smaller, easier to carry weapon with a folding wire-stock) that was specifically designed for and issued to American paratroopers. Many of the M1 carbines are also seen with the post-war modifications of a bayonet lug and/or adjustable ramp rear sight. The sergeant played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCaan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCaan">James Caan</a> carries a carbine with both of these anachronistic modifications.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFewGoodMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFewGoodMen">A Few Good Men</a></em>, Kaffee notes that Lt. Colonel Markinson committed suicide with a .45, yet the scene depicting his death clearly shows him shooting himself with a Beretta; the dialogue was likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">a carryover from the original stage production</a>, which was written before the USMC adopted the Beretta.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffaloSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffaloSoldiers">Buffalo Soldiers</a></em> in a nicely self-referential way. The plot revolves around how relatively easy it was to sell off large amounts of weapons stolen from US army bases in Germany. After the Cold War ended and US troops returned home, vast amounts of materiel were left behind. One member of the film crew owned 100 of the appropriate guns to lend the production. Where one character is given a particularly heavy gun to carry on exercises as a punishment, there was some difficulty in sourcing this gun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker">The Hurt Locker</a></em> has several scenes with U.S. soldiers wielding original-model Beretta 92 pistols, the precursor to the 92F and FS which was used by the U.S. military under the "M9" designation. The DVD commentary reveals that the blank-adapted 92FS prop they intended to use was delayed in customs, and the writer Mark Boal had to go hunting for a replacement locally. He eventually found a Jordanian General who gave the production team an old 92 to use until their own prop could clear customs. Fortunately the two pistols were similar enough to fool most moviegoers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em> has the British agent Peggy Carter, whose weapon is a Walther PPK handgun. The movie is set during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, when the most famous users of this gun were the German police and the Nazi Party officials. This can be somewhat justified by two facts:
<ol><li> The Walther PP (Polizei Pistole) was introduced in 1929, the PPK (Polizei Pistole Kriminal, i.e. "Detective's Pistol") followed it in 1931. Both were available commercially before the war, in both the UK and USA.
</li><li> When the war started, one of the first things the British SOE and American OSS did was acquire as many German and European-made handguns, rifles, etc., as they could lay their hands on, with special emphasis on anything that was military- or police-issue in occupied territory. The reason being that arming their agents with the other guy's weapons made it easier for their agents to acquire ammunition, etc., and harder for the enemy to trace back to their agents if the gun needed to be used and then disposed of.
</li></ol></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows">Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</a></em> features the Germans manufacturing or using several firearm models that are anachronistic for the film's early 1890s setting. Chief among them is the classic Mauser C96 pistol, which (while not referred to by name on-screen) wouldn't have been manufactured for at least a few years later (production stared in 1896). It is also incorrectly referred to as capable of fully automatic fire, while the real thing was only semi-automatic (in fact, one of the very first semi-automatic pistols). It would only receive full-auto variants during the interwar period (1927 at the earliest). Also, several of the artillery pieces seen in the film (especially the German mortar) would only come into existence a few years prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, at least more than a decade after the events of the film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">However</a>, the uniforms and Gewehr 88 rifles used by the German guards and soldiers are period accurate. A non-weapon goof that fits this trope is that the "German" steam locomotives in the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTrainWrong">are actually of British manufacture</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">wouldn't have been around for another few decades</a>.
</li><li> Most of the guns used by the USDF in <em>Alien Outpost</em> are dressed up South African Galil copies, which is all well and good. What's odd is one soldier using an XM177, a weapon that went out of production in the '70s, and the German soldier pulling out a Luger P08 (which was already on the way out during World War II).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em> has a handful of guns that don't quite fit its Civil War timeframe. Blondie uses a Winchester 1866 "Yellow Boy" rifle (slightly modified to make it resemble a Henry rifle) and Tuco finds both an 1868 Garland revolver and an 1889 Bodeo when he's robbing the gun store. It's a common misconception that Blondie's revolver, an 1851 Colt Navy converted to fire cartridges, is an anachronism, but such conversions were available as early as 1858.

At three different point antagonist Anton Chigurh uses a Glock 19 (not developed until 1983), a TEC-9 (produced in 1985), and a Remington 11-87 (produced in 1987). Llewelyn also acquires a Heckler &amp; Koch SP89 at one point, which didn't enter production until 1989, although this is standing in for the proper MP5k (which entered production in '76) that was used in the novel.

Not only is it a distinctly <em>American</em> firearm, but at the time the film was made, it had only been in military service for a year at most, making its appearance in the film even more implausible. This was apparently a very odd form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>, as Colt is specifically thanked in the credits for supplying weapons for the film.

He's also an experienced NSA agent, so he knows that nobody uses these anymore.

The 1911 was discontinued as the Army's standard-issue sidearm in 1985. While Colt may have been serving during that time, whatever deployment to Kuwait he's referring to (he's stated to have been deployed both during Desert Storm and the Iraq War) would have been well after the Army discontinued the 1911. Special Operations Forces continued using the weapon for some time after 1985, but Colt is expressly identified as having been military police.

This weapon <em>was</em> used in a few Warsaw Pact countries, but only as an interim substitute for the AK-47 and they were long gone by the 1970s.
</li><li> The episode "Fall Girl" had the odd incidence of British Special Branch agents armed with Soviet TT-33 pistols.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> of "Hunter/Hunted" is an <a class="urllink" href="http://modernfirearms.net/smg/usa/american-10-e.html">American 180<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Because a blank-firing version of this highly restricted automatic weapon would not have been available in Britain at the time, an AR-10 rifle is given a top-mounted Thompson drum magazine and a mock laser sight. For plot-related reasons it's also stated to be a long-range rifle instead of a submachine gun.

</li><li> The Steyr AUG seems to be the standard rifle aboard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>. Given that most of the ship's crew members are American and British, it is rather odd seeing them using a type of bullpup rifle which their nations had so far never adopted en masse. Presumably this is because of their futuristic look and because they'd be unfamiliar to British and American audiences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> both commits and averts this trope, often even in the same scene. From season 4 onwards, the team's MP5 submachine guns (which ARE issued in the U.S. military) were replaced by the Belgian FN P90 personal defense weapon. The only American users of the P90 are the Secret Service and some U.S. law enforcement agencies. However, actual U.S. military weapons also appear in the show quite often: the Beretta M9 pistol, the M4A1 carbine, the M16 assault rifle, and the M249 SAW to name a few. Another straight play of the trope occurs much later in the series: when Cameron Mitchell joins the team, the SGC starts using the H&amp;K G36 and MP7 PDW.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is the 9mm round fired by the MP5 was simply not powerful enough to reliably penetrate Jaffa armor, resulting in a lot of ammunition expended for little purpose. SGC switched to the P90, along with assault rifles, specifically because the 5.7mm round has extremely good penetration against a variety of materials, making it more effective against Jaffa than the MP5. The real life reason for the switch was for safety. When an episode required the cast to stand side by side and firing weapons, the crew realized the hot spent casings from the MP5's would be flying into actors' faces. Since the P90 ejects spent casings downward, the switch was made to maintain the safety of the actors.
</li><li> During the opening phases of the second Gulf War, it was necessary for the <em>Stargate</em> production crew to cut down on their use of the P90, with it only being carried by O'Neill, whilst Carter carried the 'Carter Special'. This was due to the fact that factories that would otherwise have produced the 5.7mm blanks were busy producing live rounds.
</li><li> This trope is played glaringly straight almost any time the SGC runs into an offworld civilization that's using firearms. There is one episode where the other civilization was <em>clearly</em> using M1 Garands and AKs.
</li><li> The use of (for example) the P90 by Stargate Command has some real-world plausibility, even though it's not standard U.S. military equipment. In real life, Special Operations Command can make use of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htproc/articles/20080911.aspx">RFI (Rapid Fielding Initiative)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to bypass the usual slow-moving procurement system and buy whatever they need directly. SGC would be in a somewhat analogous position to SOCOM (i.e., a relatively small but well-financed and highly important element of the military), quite possibly with even more RFI freedom.
</li><li> It's worth noting that although the Stargate program started out as a secret operation by the US military, throughout the series it became much more international in character. Russia was heavily involved from quite early on, a few other countries (the UK, China and France most prominently) had at least some involvement, and by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> (concurrent with seasons 8-10 of SG-1) it had become much more open. The main cast of <em>Atlantis</em> included a Canadian and a Scottish character, with only two out of six main characters actually being American (the other two being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>). So non-standard and non-American weapons may not be as out of place as they might seem.

<ul><li> In "Time and Again", the terrorists use Calico pistols and the Detonics Pocket 9. At least the producers went to the trouble of selecting weapons that looked different from regular firearms and are obscure enough that people who aren't gun enthusiasts wouldn't recognize them.
</li><li> In "Nemesis", the Vori Defenders use bullpup assault rifles including the British SA80, while Kradin soldiers use a Kalashnikov model that's been modified with plastic coverings. This is meant to invoke the gung-ho action movies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, as propaganda is a major theme of the episode.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em> has the female Nazi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> all wielding <em>British</em> Sten guns. Whether this is acceptable is up for debate, since the Germans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">did make their own copies of the Sten near the end of the war</a>, but the majority of them were visibly different from the original and meant for the Volkssturm, a militia force that was about as far from "elite" as possible, made up of people who hadn't already been in the regular army hastily equipped as a desperate attempt to hold off the Soviets in the final days of the European theatre of the war.

While these were already in widespread use at the time, these weapons were given mostly to US Army units, with the Marines having to rely on older weapons like Springfields or M1917 Browning machine guns. Though, it's implied the Marines here received surplus stocks from the Army, or simply stole the weapons from them, as was common during the Guadalcanal campaign.
</li></ul></li><li> Funny enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaII">Mafia II</a></em>, whose prologue starts in Sicily, and quite possibly is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em>Airborne</em>, also has Italian Blackshirts armed with German weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> features an M1A1 Carbine with an anachronistic adjustable rear sight. This can likely be explained in that they had to model it after a real-live example, and M1 Carbines that both saw service in the war and escaped the upgrades afterwards are extremely rare. <em>Call of Duty 2</em> featured the original M1 with period-accurate sights, but now it's far rarer than it probably should be in an odd form of game balance (the devs saw that everybody used it all the time and cut it down to a very small handful of appearances to curb this, apparently never noticing that everybody used it all the time because <strong>they gave it</strong> to the player all the time).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em>:
<ul><li> During the introductory assault course, the range master has two Desert Eagles, him brandishing the chrome-plated model <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling">taken from CoD4</a> before giving the player character a two-tone one (with misaligned sights, at that). Keep in mind these are US Army Rangers in Afghanistan: Desert Eagles are definitely <em>not</em> standard issue (nor do the Rangers use chrome-plated <em>anything</em>), and getting caught using an unapproved firearm can land you into <em>serious</em> trouble. Then again, the weapon boxes he opens before you run the Pit also contain a number of weapons that aren't standard-issue - including SPAS-12s, Mini-Uzis and even the same modded AK the Russians use later in the game - and, unless you pick up something without a suppressor in a stealth-based mission, nobody ever so much as bats an eye if you drop one of your starting guns for one that someone had just been trying to kill you with. It seems that Task Force 141, like many other special forces organizations, doesn't mind too much about the use of unorthodox equipment (Soap at one point directly encourages it, asking if you "see anything you like" in the Gulag's armory), though why the player as an Army Ranger can also take guns from enemies without consequence is purely for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>.
</li><li> What's funny to note about <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> is that <em>only one of the weapons the Russians use makes sense</em>. This is the Dragunov SVD - and even then, it's still in its original, older wooden-furniture version, rather than the synthetic SVD-M that modern Russian forces actually use. The RPG-7 makes some sense, but even that is not the favored rocket launcher anymore, nor has it been for quite a while. Most of the other guns used by the game's Russian forces <em>aren't even Russian</em> - for example, the Israeli TAR-21, the French FAMAS, or the Austrian Steyr AUG among their frontline troops, while security forces at Zakhaev International Airport use the Italian Beretta 92 and Swiss MP9.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6lkyl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6lkyl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6lkyl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Russia <em>does</em> use the MP9 in reality, but only among special forces in the FSB, not regular airport security - when the FSB <em>do</em> show up in that mission, they've got MP5s instead.</span> The other ones that are Russian, such as the RPD and AK-47, have long since been replaced in military use. Still others, like the AA-12 and KRISS Vector, had <em>not even been put into production</em> at the time of release (and still aren't Russian, either - both of those are <em>American</em>).
</li><li> You might be excused for thinking Fabrique Nationale is a subsidiary of the Russian arms industry thanks to these games: the FN P90TR and F2000 are used exclusively by the Russians and Makarov's Inner Circle, while the FN FAL appears exclusively in the hands of other enemies, despite FN being a NATO supplier in reality. The P90 is a beloved PDW for NATO forces, and the F2000 is in service with Pakistan and India... neither of whom are belligerents in <em>MW2</em>; as for the FAL, it was the primary firearm of the British Commonwealth during the Cold War, and is roughly analogous to the American M14, at one time meant to be <em>the</em> standard NATO rifle - so finding it in the hands of Russian soldiers is somewhat bizarre. But Infinity Ward apparently thought they looked cool, so here they are.
<ul><li> Then again, all these new weapons are possibly justifiable — by this point, Russia has a new government, so it's possible they decided to revamp their military arsenal. And since evidence in-game points to them having been looking for an excuse to attack America before Makarov gave them one, switching over to an arsenal using the same ammo as theirs makes some sense.

</div><ul><li> There's also the G18, which is a modified Glock 17 standing in for the full-auto Glock 18. As mentioned at the top of the page, this is a common occurrence in films, and the most likely reason why the same thing happens in this game, where they can model whatever guns they want (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun">sawed-down</a> Model 1887 shotguns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">being flip-cocked after every shot</a>) is that they modeled it after such a movie gun without bothering to change it at all. This sort of thing has been a recurring problem in the series, airsoft guns in particular making frequent appearances such as the <em>CoD4</em> "AK-74u" (based on JG's "AK Beta-F") or <em>MW2</em>'s M4 model (JG M4 S-System). Additionally, the Beretta 93R machine pistol is actually a 92SB (the same gun standing in for the M9 here and in <em>CoD4</em>) with the skeleton stock and forward grip of a 93R added on - and even for the remastered campaign released in 2020, they were able to get a proper 92FS model for the M9, but still based the 93R model on it.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong">plane-based example</a> comes with the F-15s bombing the Gulag in its eponymous mission. The F-15s are used in a Wild Weasel role at the start of the mission, launching missiles at hostile AA guns to let the Little Birds holding the player and other soldiers into the gulag - specifically, they're the AGM-88 HARM, an anti-radiation missile that no F-15 variant is compatible with, and which are called with a "Fox" brevity code (used only for air-to-air munitions; the proper code for a HARM would be "Magnum"). Not to mention as well that the US Navy is apparently the force involved in the attack on the Gulag, and they don't use the F-15 (nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">would they ever use an Air Force plane</a> if they can help it).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> adds a Russian machine gun that's actually in use by modern Russian forces (the PKP Pecheneg - ignoring, of course, that it's meant primarily for mounted usage), but otherwise goes all-out with this trope: the new Russian military sidearm is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">never-produced</a> (and intended for sales to <em>American</em> civilians) MP412 REX while FSO agents use the US Government model of the FN Five-seveN, African militia favor the (conceptual) <em>Peruvian</em> FAD assault rifle, a flashback to Zakhaev's assassination attempt now includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">a few Remington RSASS rifles</a> which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">weren't there the first time around</a>, and multiplayer allows the use of both the Chinese QBZ-97 assault rifle and the Japanese PM-9 machine pistol, despite neither the PLA nor the JSDF being present anywhere in the game. For added hilarity, the aforementioned QBZ-97 (misidentified as the earlier -95), as a bullpup assault rifle that fires in bursts, serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> for the second game's FAMAS - despite that the GIGN are playable in multiplayer and appear in one campaign level, thus meaning it would make perfect sense for the FAMAS to return.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em> which features several anachronistic faults in regards to firearms shown in the game. The FN FAL in particular - commonly known as the "Right Arm of the Free World" for its use by many Western-aligned nations, including every NATO member state except the US and West Germany - is only used, of all people, by <em>Vietcong</em> and <em>Cuban</em> soldiers in single player. To the developers' credit, the second example is slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, since the specific model of the FAL seen in the game was part of a shipment of about 500 of these firearms, all delivered to the Cuban police. But other parts of the game return to playing this trope straight, since while the Cuban soldiers only appear in the first level of the game it's never explained why <em>every other</em> Soviet-aligned military present in the game uses the FAL as well (or why half of the Viet Cong soldiers armed with them also have American M203 grenade launchers attached to them); technically, the FAL was also in service as the semi-auto L1A1 Self Loading Rifle with Australian soldiers stationed in Vietnam, so the argument <em>could</em> be made the ones encountered in Vietcong hands are simply captured rifles. It's somewhat harder to justify the highly anachronistic French FAMAS FELIN Russians occasionally use, except the FAMAS was a Russian staple weapon in <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> first, so it could again just be a matter of following the leader. Also, both the Soviet special forces seen in the 1968 Kowloon mission and the Vietcong in Huế City use the SPAS-12 shotgun  a firearm model from <em>Italy</em> which was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">1982</a></em>. The turret in the beginning of the Vorkuta level has a mounted American M249 SAW, which was made in 1984, and the player also acquires a hand-held version of the M134 Minigun, which didn't enter service until 1963 (and is also not man-portable, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">we can forgive that part</a>) and finally escapes the prison on the back of a motorcycle while flip-cocking a Winchester 1887. Several campaign levels also feature the KS-23 shotgun, a 23mm riot gun that while at least actually being a Russian model (despite it like the FAL appearing primarily in Cuban and Vietcong hands - even Mason starts with it in a mission or two set in Vietnam) was not designed until 1971 and on top of that wasn't meant for actual combat use - it was a riot gun meant for keeping the peace in prisons. The closest any of these get to an actual justification is the last part of "Crash Site", where the presence of a single American China Lake grenade launcher (next to a crate full of Soviet SVDs) in a downed Soviet cargo plane is briefly and weakly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> as "some kind of setup". Somewhere, a firearms enthusiast is drinking themselves to death.
<ul><li> Though come to think of it, the plot's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> does provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">a possible justification.</a> It especially works considering that the missions where you play as Hudson - who is not the person giving the exposition - have even more crazy scenarios and technology than the missions where you play as Mason (they're the only levels in which the player is allowed to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a>, for instance).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></em> doesn't have nearly as many examples, partly since there are only four missions set during the Cold War like in the previous game, but it's still around mostly by way of reusing weapons from the first game for its flashback arsenal, most of which were outdated and replaced by the mid- to late-80s setting. So, for instance, Woods uses an original-model M16 (misidentified as the improved A1) for Operation Just Cause, at a point in time where the military had switched to the M16A2 and a combat scenario where the "Commando" - a CAR-15 - would have made more sense. A particular screamer, however, is from the second flashback level, set during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan</a>. It would have actually made sense for the game to give some of those mid-80's Soviet troops the RPK-74 used in the first game - instead, they're given the old belt-fed RPD machine guns the RPK-74 replaced in the real world. Worse, that RPD model <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropRecycling">is lifted directly from</a> <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, complete with a Picatinny rail over the feed tray that shouldn't exist for another nine years at that point (and which Russian military guns in general didn't start using until another decade or so after that). The player also has the option of invoking this with the singleplayer version of Create-a-Class; nothing is preventing them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">taking an '80s gun they like into</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">2025 levels</a>, for instance using that old M16 when the standard JSOC rifles seem to be the HK416 and a slightly dressed-up XM8... or, after completing the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">doing the opposite</a> and, say, fighting a battle in the Angolan Civil War with the KRISS KARD pistol (still not in production even years after the game came out) and a completely fictional weapon like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">cover-penetrating</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision">x-ray-scoped</a> "Storm PSR".

Actually not that ridiculous an example, as <a class="urllink" href="https://ww2militaria.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/ppsh_germanforces.jpg">the Germans in the real life war<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> were rather fond of these Soviet weapons and often kept them as war trophies, even having PPShs rechambered to fire the German 9mm round and designated MP-41(r), while the SVT-40s saw widespread use as the Germans lacked a worthwhile self-loading rifle until Walther used the captured weapon as inspiration for the G43. Still, Germans using captured Soviet weapons in such numbers <em>outside</em> of the Eastern Front stretches belief.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> series has been subject to this trope ever since its first installment. Examples:
<ul><li> The American and Russian Sniper and Engineer classes used British Lee-Enfield No. 3 rifles instead of Springfield M1903s or Mosin-Nagant rifles. A later patch replaced the USMC Engineer's No. 3 with the M1 Garand, but the US Army Engineer as well as the Sniper for both factions still use the Lee-Enfield.
</li><li> The Russian and British Assault class originally used the Browning Automatic Rifle. A later patch replaced the Russian BAR with the DP-1928, and the SAS Assault in the Secret Weapons of WWII expansion got the Bren.
<ul><li> The Assault classes in general, save for the Germans and their StG 44, all use machine guns which are treated as generic assault rifles - not only usable but even viable for operation by a single person, issued far more extensively than in reality, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">pathetically weak</a> compared to much smaller and logically weaker weapons. The bolt-action and semi-auto rifles that were actual standard-issue are only used by the aforementioned Sniper and Engineer classes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Russian Medic uses an MP-18, as opposed to the ridiculously common PPSH-41. This might be for balance reasons, as the PPSH's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">71-round drum</a> would give Russian medics a noticeable advantage in multiplayer (and the devs presumably overlooked that it could also use 35-round mags).
</li><li> Most of the Japanese classes in general all use German weapons, while the Engineer uses the experimental and never issued Type 5 Rifle. The Assault class used the StG 44, though like the above, a patch eventually replaced it with the Type 99.
</li><li> The Russian army in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a> 2</em> uses two Russian assault rifles and a handgun alongside <em>Chinese</em> machine guns and sniper rifles and a <em>Swedish</em> RPG. What's even weirder is that the game features a wide assortment of much more sensible modern Russian firearms<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7dlh3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7dlh3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7dlh3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though still preferring rare guns over actual standard-issue hardware - the standard AK-74 or AK-74M is completely ignored in favor of the prototype AEK-971, the special forces-only AN-94, and the less-issued but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">far more well-known</a> AKS-74U carbine</span>, but the majority of them are only usable in multiplayer.
</li><li> In general, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em>, players can choose from a wide assortment of weapons... such as weapons that were never used by the playable factions (such as the F2000, the KH2002, and the FAMAS Surbaissé), weapons that were only designed for civilian use (like the Cobray Street Sweeper and Barrett Model 98B), and even weapons that <em>never left the prototype stage</em> (the MP-412 REX, Magpul PDR, and Pancor Jackhammer).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHardline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHardline">Hardline</a></em> is arguably even worse in this regard. It's one thing to imagine an experimental assault rifle in the hands of a spec ops trooper, it's an entirely different ball game imagining them being used by domestic law enforcement, let alone gang-bangers.
</li><li> This is what some people are complaining about in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1">Battlefield 1</a></em>, what with the prevalence of automatic weapons and prototype firearms, instead of the bolt-action rifles and melee weapons that were so common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. This is averted in the game mode "Back to Basics" in which the all classes are equipped with only the unscoped bolt-action rifles used by their respective nations (e.g. the British can only use the SMLE and the Germans can only use the Gewehr 98).
</li><li> <em>Battlefield 1</em> also has plenty of weapons in the game that were either exceedingly rare but did see limited frontline service (such as the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and Selbstlader 1916), mass produced but never saw combat (such as the Huot Automatic Rifle) and weapons that never got past the prototype stage and never saw mass production (such as the Selbstlader 1906, Hellriegel 1915 and Mars Automatic Pistol).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> has the "SCAR" as the default US assault rifle, except the game was produced before the SCAR trials were finished and the rifle shown in-game has elements of both Heckler &amp; Koch's XM8 and Fabrique Nationale's proto-SCAR from the time.
</li><li> While all the other guns in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament">Unreal Tournament</a></em> (set around 2293) are futuristic enough, the game's sniper rifle is merely a long-barreled, early model M16 with a scope attached to the carry handle, a rather out-of-place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13">Golgo 13</a></em>. Lampshaded in the old official site's timeline of the series, where the in-universe explanation for replacing it with the Lightning Gun in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">UT2003</a></em> was that it was "a relic of centuries past".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, set in the mid-26th century, still fluffs most of the UNSC's weapons as using cartridges originating from the 20th century. Though canon has occasionally implied that these aren't <em>quite</em> the same as the 20th century originals, the only apparent advancement in ammunition we see in the original trilogy is a caseless weapon (the SMG from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> and on) that's actually viable in sustained combat. The series also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">tends to favor larger calibers</a> than real-world militaries would use for the same purposes no matter how overpowered such a round would be, which already reaches the apex of silliness in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">the first game</a> - the pistol is firing what is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">.50 Action Express</a>, yet while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> Master Chief properly uses both hands to fire it, <em>none</em> of your allies seen using it (and none of whom are augmented in any way, mind) have any issues <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringOneHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringOneHanded">one-handing the thing</a> without the gun smacking into their faces after every shot.

<ul><li> The Grease Gun serves as the main weapon... of the Soviet military stationed in Prague. <em>In 1989.</em>

</li></ul></li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em>, the standard caliber seems to be 10mm for pistols and submachine guns. Also, Desert Eagles are plentiful as well. Something that all <em>Fallout</em> games feature are man-portable miniguns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> introduces Tommy Guns (using 50-round drum magazines) and Grease Guns as the only .45 caliber weapons; 9mm is present, but so rare that the primary method of obtaining it is a glitch<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8fdl9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8fdl9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8fdl9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the version of the P90 in-game was meant to use 9mm ammo, and as such comes with some whenever you find one, but the glitch means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">it will also load 10mm ammo just fine</a></span>. It also has town guards carrying as standard issue the rare G11 caseless weapons and the never-produced Pancor Jackhammer and H&amp;K CAWS shotguns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel">Fallout Tactics</a></em> has the Chauchat machine gun from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> as a joke weapon, even though it was manufactured in France and only during the war, which by the time the game takes place was almost 300 years in the past. It was also notoriously unreliable - it will not fire in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> introduces the "Chinese Assault Rifle", which is an AK-47 clone chambered for 5.56mm. This may be justified as Chinese infiltrators invading the continental United States during the war (it's confirmed that they were pushing into Alaska, and the L.O.B. Enterprises building where you find a unique version of the "Chinese Pistol" has terminals confirming they were working for the Chinese military).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> adds a lot of old western lever-action weapons to the mix, but they justify adding the Colt M1911 (though never mentioned by name) with the <em>Honest Hearts</em> DLC, by including it as the weapon of choice of the New Caananites.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9s4lx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9s4lx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9s4lx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">New Caanan is explicitly stated to be built on the ruins of Ogden, Utah.

From the same game, the generic "Anti-materiel rifle" is the Hécate II, a rifle designed and built only in France.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters">Freedom Fighters</a></em> primarily sees weapons in the hands of Soviet forces that you would expect to see: the AK-103, the SVD, the PKM, and the rarer Bizon submachine gun. But the SPAS-12 is carried by all Soviet officers, who probably wouldn't carry a shotgun of any kind, let alone such a rare and western model (It's also seen in NYPD cars and armories, where it also wouldn't be) and the only sidearm used by the Soviets is the Beretta 92. In an inversion, the streets of New York City seem completely empty of any other weapons that would normally be widely found in America, except for the occasional magnum revolver.

While chronologically correct (the game is set in 2009, the rifle came out in 1993), the AN-94 is a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a> due to a very high cost, low reliability and ergonomics issues; the only users of the rifle are selected counter-terrorism Russian units. Made even weirder by the fact that some enemies use the still uncommon but way easier to obtain AKS-74U, but for some reason <em>they're</em> the ones in more specific, smaller roles (defense of the cores of the Big Shell). Less impossible but no less strange, if you alert the guards and then hide, the clearing teams they send to find you are armed with the SPAS-12, a weapon of which only 37,000 were made.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel">Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</a></em> zig-zags this, and partly justifies it by the Gindra Liberation Front securing several high-tech, state-of-the-art weapons thanks to making a lot of money from trafficking drugs and rare metals. The basic handgun is a Five-seveN, an odd pistol to use in central Africa given that its high cost prevented mass-adoption, and the ammo is relatively rare as well since wide adoption of the PDW concept by NATO was stalled. The assault rifle, however, is a Vektor R5, a derivative of the IMI Galil SAR that is manufactured in South Africa and actually is used by several African nations.

On the other hand, intentionally or not it could be a demonstration of how technology ended up going in different ways from reality thanks to the economic repercussions of Tiberium's arrival - cutscenes, for instance, indicate that the YF-23, another aircraft that only had two prototypes in reality, is GDI's standard jet fighter, while the YF-22, the winning competitor in the Advanced Tactical Fighter program that was developed into the F-22 Raptor, is used by Nod in those cutscenes, or that Nod uses the AH-64 because GDI has upgraded to the completely fictional Orca VTOL.

<ul><li> Andy Rooney (who was a correspondent during WWII) once told the story of a platoon of American soldiers who came across a German weapons cache. Either out of curiosity or necessity, they equipped themselves with the best guns the Third Reich had to offer. To paraphrase: "A U.S. mortar team, hearing the familiar sound of German firearms to their flank, dropped round after round on that position until the firing stopped..."
</li><li> Similarly, there was at least one American unit in World War 2 that got itself trapped behind German lines and ran low on supplies. They ended up having to hunt venison using captured German rifles to avoid alerting enemies to their presence. On the other side, German soldiers loved to use Allied semi-auto rifles (the M1 Carbine was particularly well-liked for its light weight, low recoil and high magazine capacity compared to anything else available at the time; the SVT-40, meanwhile, served as the inspiration for their own later Gewehr 43) and Russian submachine guns whenever they had the chance to do so, giving the PPSh-41 and PPS-43 unique designations (respectively MP717(r) and MP719(r)) and even making a 9mm version of them.
</li><li> There are numerous photos from the Eastern Front showing German troops with Russian Tokarev and Simonov semi-automatic rifles in 1941-43, in addition to the PPSh-41 submachine guns. During the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa, they captured so much Soviet materiel that it just made sense to use the weapons and ammunition. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">Interservice Rivalry</a> between the Wehrmacht (the regular armed forces, which controlled the weapons procurement process) and the Waffen-SS meant that early in the war, the Waffen-SS relied heavily on captured foreign weapons.
</li><li> Two fun facts on the ammo score; first, the Russian SMGs that used 7.62x25mm Tokarev easily fit into the German logistics train because it was an enhanced version of the 7.63x25mm Mauser round, which the Germans had lots of. And second, the reasons the British Sten Gun was chambered for 9mm Parabellum, the German issue round, were first of all that no comparable self-loading pistol round was made in England (SMGs don't work too well with rimmed revolver cartridges); and second, when the Italian forces in North Africa surrendered to the British 8th Army in 1941 (before the Afrika Korps arrived), part of the booty was several million rounds of Italian-made 9mm Para ammunition, as their Beretta SMGs also used it (this one actually backfired, sometimes horribly: the Italian rounds came either in an underpowered variant for older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> models or an overpowered one for the Beretta Mod. 38: if used on more modern guns, the underpowered rounds would fail to cycle and cause a jam, and the overpowered ones could only be used with the Mod. 38s or on any gun that's designed to handle over-pressure ammunition<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ceko');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ceko" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ceko');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The modern-day Russian 7N21 overpressure variant of the 9x19 round is way hotter than Mod. 38 load</span>, or else they'd literally blow up the gun).
<ul><li> Similarly convenient for the Germans was that many of the nations they conquered in first years of the war used variants of the Mauser bolt-action rifle, which not only fired the same 7.92x57mm round as the German K98k but were similar in size and even had bolts that were interchangeable with the K98k. Likewise, Poland and Czechoslovakia used light and heavy machine guns chambered in 7.92x57mm, allowing the Germans to press all those weapons into service without any logistical problems.
</li></ul></li><li> British infantry units realized there was no comparison between their Bren guns and the standard German squad MGs (MG34 and MG42) when it came to laying down sheer volume of fire (the Bren remained unparalleled for delivering short bursts of extremely accurate MG fire, but sometimes you need more than a thirty-round magazine). As often as not captured German MGs would be pressed into service - but at the risk of their distinctive sound bringing down the wrong sort of attention from friendly forces mistaking the users for Germans. The Armored Corps in particular would often used the Besa machine gun, in 8mm Mauser, on models of tanks designed in Britain (American tanks such as the Sherman retained their Browning machine guns) because of the difficulty in chambering it in .303 and because their supply chain was separate from the main Army's, thus not causing many issues by the use of non-standard equipment. It also allowed them to use captured German ammunition.
</li><li> Until the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Italian weapons found their way in some unlikely hands (always for a good reason):
<ul><li> The Beretta Mod. 38 SMG was used on both sides of the conflict, as it could fire standard 9mm Para rounds just as well as the preferred overpowered variant and was extremely reliable and accurate, even if large and heavy, so Allied forces would use captured weapons... And, after the start of their occupation of Northern Italy (including the factories they were made in), the Germans would buy part of the production, including the overpowered round (West German army and federal police would continue using them until the sixties). Also, a small number (50) was used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>, successfully delivered in spite of Allied blockade.
</li><li> The FNAB-43 and TZ-45 SMGs, produced in the Italian Social Republic (the Mussolini-led puppet state created by the Germans in the areas of Italy they occupied), was used by both Mussolini's soldiers and German troops. The latter was also used by <em>Burmese</em> troops (the State of Burma, being a puppet of Imperial Japan, was considered an ally, so they were allowed to produce it under licence).
</li><li> The Carcano Mod. 91 rifle and its variants have the others beat through sheer weirdness, being used by: Ethiopia (that actually acquired it <em>before the Italian Army itself</em>: emperor Menelik, aiming to shake the Italian protectorate, used the credits Italy had given him to buy it. As he was successful, he never paid for it); Bulgaria; Persia; Romania; Saudi Arabia; Finland (Italy had tried to switch to a more powerful rifle round but had to abort due the early start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, so they shipped all the new rounds they had manufactured and a number of rifles to help in the Winter War, where, after a trial period on the frontline, was issued to rear-guard troops and the Navy due the logistical issues of keeping the troops supplied and other issues); Somalia (as a consequence of its past as an Italian colony); <em>Imperial Japan</em> (after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">invasion of China</a>, all Arisaka production was required to supply the Army, so the Navy, that needed rifles too, contacted Italy under the terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and was supplied with 120,000 Carcano rifles modified to use a box magazine and the standard Japanese round); the Independent State of Croatia (a puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy); and the <em>National Liberation Army of Libya during the 2011 civil war</em> (another remnant of the past as an Italian colony. Militants found them in government arsenals or simply passed them down in the family until they were used again at war).
</li></ul></li><li> It should be noted however, that thanks to Lend-Lease Act, the Soviet Red Army utilised a substantial number of British Matilda, Cromwell and Churchill tanks, as well as American Sherman tanks. Several American weapons also saw service with the Red Army thanks to Lend-Lease; the famous AK, in fact, had its bolt essentially copied from a leased M1 Garand.

Meaning that, aside for weapons produced locally or bought from allies or the US, Italian troops relied on Austro-Hungarian machine guns (more reliable than the standard FIAT machine gun of the Italians, put into production over a better and cheaper model due to bribery) and older <em>gunpowder multi-barreled rapid-fire weapons</em>, ranging from sensibly-sized weapons like the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordenfelt_gun">Nordenfelt gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-inch_Nordenfelt_gun">1-inch Nordenfelt gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (for naval use against torpedo boats) and the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QF_3_pounder_Hotchkiss">QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (another naval weapon).
</li><li> There are more firearms in China that are not classically Communist-ish than other "red" countries.
<ul><li> The Chinese army used Austrian SSG 69 sniper rifles in the China-Vietnam war of 1979, imported through third-party countries. Today, the SPC (Special Police Commando) and PLA Special Force units use its descendant, the SSG 3000, and American Remington M700 rifles for hostage rescue and patrol missions.
</li><li> The most common machine gun in China, the Type 67 is an upgraded WWII-era DPM, itself an upgrade of the DP28.
</li><li> Licensed copies of Czech, Polish and Israeli SMGs are produced and used in small scale by the Chinese Armed Police Forces.
</li><li> The SPC in Chungqing used CQA assult rifles and NR08 SMGs in the past decade, the former is a semi-licensed AR-15 copy and the latter is an MP5 copy.
</li><li> China's primary arms company, Norinco, produces an unlicensed copy of the M16A1 known as the Norinco CQ. Although it never saw much service with the Chinese military, primarily intended for export sales, what makes it notable is that the Iranian military has been producing unlicensed copies of the unlicensed copy, one of which became the primary assault rifle of the Iranian military. Despite <a class="urllink" href="http://gallery.military.ir/albums/userpics/IMG_0004~0.JPG">looking radically unlike an M16<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, the KH-2002 is heavily based on this Chinese M16 copy.
</li></ul></li><li> With genuine enemy equipment often hard to come by, training units that simulate enemy forces often use friendly vehicles and aircraft painted - and sometimes structurally modified - to look like those of enemy forces.
<ul><li> During WWII the Russians trained dogs to run under tanks, the plan being to strap them with bombs and unleash them on the advancing Germans. They lacked actual German tanks to train with, however. Many stories exist as to how badly this plan failed, though one involves the dogs performing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">exactly as trained</a> and going under their own tanks. The main problem was that Soviet tanks had diesel engines, whereas their German counterparts ran on gasoline; the differences in scent had confused the dogs, and they sought out the more-familiar smelling tanks.
