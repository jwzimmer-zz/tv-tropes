Extra points if he woos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter">The Chief's Daughter</a> along the way; an unfortunately common variation that perpetuates into present-day media is that she will continue to love our hero even if he is <em>directly</em> responsible for the death of her husband, brother, or father.
</p><p>Sometimes the foreign societies are shown to be realistic, three-dimensional and actually rather pleasant places to live. Indeed, sometimes the native peoples are shown to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">better</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">in some way</a> than European society and the white man begins to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">despise his old home.</a> All this is a setup for the white man to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">adapt to the Native's ways</a>, thereby making him superior both to the natives <em>and</em> the Europeans back home. In modern-day fiction, sometimes the Mighty Whitey is there to lead or inspire the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNatives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNatives">Hollywood Natives</a> or bring some aspect of modern technology or knowledge to their aid, something they presumably could not do before he showed up. One particular version has it so that the sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> whitey is not only now the Great White Hope for the non-white Noble Savages, but is very often defending them from other <em>evil</em> whites.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In modern-day fiction — particularly in Hollywood movies — Mighty Whitey pops up as the result of creative types trying to appeal to as broad a cross-section of society as possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">to get their cash back.</a> And since the majority of major Hollywood stars are white Americans (despite the fact that only a small minority of their audiences are Americans at all, let alone white Americans), it's almost inevitable that the all-singing, all-dancing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead">hero</a> is also going to be registering low on the melanin count... which can become a self-perpetuating mess.
</p><p>Of course, these writers might also just be doing the respectable thing, and be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">writing what they know</a>. Perhaps not in the 'I'm a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a>' sense, but in the 'I'm used to the cultural norms of my race/gender and would be terrified of offending people with incorrect cultures cues' sense. Or in the '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">What I know</a> has been mostly informed by what has already been established in fictional story-telling and I'm subconsciously perpetuating those same pas' sense. Often involves a strong element of wish fulfillment for the First World writer and First World audience, in the sense of, "I'll bet I could be a great hero if I could just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorninTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorninTheWrongCentury">escape this straight-laced and boring 'civilized' world I'm stuck in.</a>" Or it might be a combination of their or the audience's preference for a protagonist that looks like themselves combined with the natural desire to see the protagonist become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Remakes of shows/movies with the original trope often subvert this; for instance, making the Mighty Whitey into a dunce, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">Ethnic Scrappy</a> sidekick into a smart, street-savvy badass. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Sometimes this goes a little too far.</a> This trope can also occur as an unintended side effect of writers trying to show the equality of all races and cultures — in a tone-deaf and more than potentially offensive kind of way.
</p><p>Non-American media can exhibit versions of this trope tailored to <em>their</em> home audiences (e.g. the awesome guy in an Anime/Manga series being Japanese). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">But Not Too Foreign</a> is often used as a way to set up this version of Mighty Whitey.
</p><p>Can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> as it did happen in real life. Explorers from a technologically more advanced civilization had access to nutrition, education, technology, and general skills and experience that a native who never traveled further than the neighboring village didn't. Especially as only those who were already among the strongest and bravest in their home countries did have the courage and motivation to become explorers in those dangerous times. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> came in when people began to assume that they were better because of their culture, beliefs, or genetic stock, rather than access to tools and benefits derived from hundreds of years of accumulated advantages.
</p><p>As the following examples will show, the trope tends to be used pretty liberally, especially because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">the historical difficulty of defining the term "white"</a> (i.e., whether it should primarily refer to Europeans, Caucasoids, light-skinned people, or even Christians). It's most convenient to define this trope as a "modern" character achieving mastery over "ancient" or "backward" characters, not necessary with respect to race <em>per se</em>.

They were still almost entirely Northern European body-types right into the 1980s. When they decided to have a martial arts expert join the Legion—in 1966 before it was fashionable—they got Val Armorr, <em>Karate Kid</em> raised on an earth colony, allegedly of mixed human genetics, but with features and curly red-brown hair that suggested Irish ancestry, if anything.
<ul><li> There was a (probably unintentionally) funny bit in the issue which examined Val's origin, where he's absolutely SHOCKED to discover that he's not actually entirely Japanese. Despite his appearance being as white as possible without making him blond, and his name being decidedly non-Japanese.
</li><li> Jim Shooter originally wanted Ferro Lad — who joined the Legion at the same time as Karate Kid to be of African descent but got vetoed by Mort Weisinger (likely out of fear of offending readers in the South.) So Shooter had him make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> seven issues after his introduction.

In later years, the mighty whitey implications have been softened. His replacement as Sorcerer Supreme was Doctor Voodoo, a Haitian psychologist.
</li><li> Both parodied and played straight in the comic book <em>Charisma Man</em>, produced for English-speaking expatriates in Japan. The title character was a dorky Canadian unsuccessful with women in his own country - until he arrives in Japan where he instantly becomes suave and supercool, admired by all the locals and able to pick up any girl he wants. His mortal enemy is "Western Woman", the only one aware of what a loser he really is.

He was given a longbow into which he carved a notch whenever he performed a good deed. When he had attained 100 notches, would be judged worthy of having taken the mantle of the Black Marvel.

The narration in his story is casually racist towards the natives, but heaps accolades upon Zantar. A descendant of his remarks upon discussing Zantar's adventures that it's all pretty offensive.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>. Although Leetah is definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter">The Chief's Daughter</a>, Cutter and the Wolfriders mix pretty thoroughly with the Sun Folk and their cultures support each other relatively equally (and the white Wolfriders are considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a> types). It's <em>further</em> subverted with Dart, who teaches the Sun Folk warfare as a child, but it's because he's lived in the village all his life; he stays living there for most of the rest of the series.
<ul><li> The story of <em>Little Patch</em>, Tyleet´s adopted human son, plays it more straight, although Patch was raised by the wolfrider elves. Because of his woodland skills and other skills, he swiftly "out-hunts and outgraces" everyone in the human village, and eventually becomes their chief. In this story, the <em>elves</em> have the role of cultural superior beings.

He was raised by T'Chaka the former king of Wakanda and has always loved the country. However Wakanda is a fairly xenophobic country, so he was never accepted or treated with respect by people outside his family due to being white. Add T'Challa generally being treated far better than him by both their father and the people of Wakanda, and the result is a deep resentment of his brother combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">a desperate desire to be loved by others</a>. All he wants is to help Wakanda and gain the acceptance of his adoptive culture, but his desperation to do so and the natives' constant refusal of his help drove him into supervillainy.

</li><li> All of the '30s through '50s "Jungle" movies and a standard trope is a white woman having been adopted as a goddess to the native Africans. This trope was used because 1) white, and 2) a female would be subservient to the men coming to rescue her, and she wouldn't try to subjugate the tribe that's worshiping her. See <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteGoddess">White Goddess</a></em> as Example A.

Some of the (overtly racist) Ankh-Morporkian generals refer to Klatchians as the finest soldiers in the world - provided they're led by white officers - but it's quite clear that the seasoned Klatchian leaders are very competent, while the nobles leading Ankh-Morpork's hastily-assembled forces think an ideal landing spot is a desert peninsula three days' march from anything but a Klatchian fortress. On the other hand, once he visits Klatch, the white Carrot almost immediately starts fitting in and is able to order around a fearsome tribe of desert nomads, but that's more because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">he's Carrot</a> than because he's white.

The other rebel leaders are mostly raka, but spying and clever plans are shown as being basically the most important thing.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to win the favor of the Fremen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">learned their culture</a> and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">who went native</a>). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. However, this is deconstructed throughout, as Paul's abilities and the prophecy itself are just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations, and Paul knows he will become a tyrant who will unleash his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

By 1850, he's a general in the Chinese army and the chief adviser to the Emperor's brother, and he plans to make the brother Emperor so he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">rule behind the scenes</a> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a>.

<ul><li> "The Good Seed" is one of the earliest and best examples of this. Virdon and Pete's advanced old-time knowledge lets them educate their hosts, a family of ape tenant farmers, on using a block and tackle (making it easier to store hay), the importance of using the best kernels of corn to grow next year's crop and of using horizontal ploughing on hills rather than vertical (to control erosion), build a rail fence (better than the simple planted sticks fence they were using) and a windmill for them, and midwife a cow having trouble calving. It's further justified by Virdon having been a farm boy before he became an astronaut.
</li><li> There's an episode where Virdon gets shot and Pete has to retrieve a book on human medicine to teach the ape doctors to perform the life-saving surgery Virdon needs. He also has to educate them on how to properly match blood types for blood transfusions.
</li><li> "Tomorrow's Tide" hinges on them teaching a fishing colony how to make fishing nets rather than rely on just individual fishing spears.
</li><li> "The Cure" revolves around them helping a village that is being plagued by malaria, teaching them how to identify the tree that makes the antidote and instructing them on the importance of avoiding mosquito bites and draining the stagnant water where the plague-carrying mosquitoes breed.

Lily-white Daenerys Targaryen has just liberated a city's slaves, and they come out to hail her as "Mother." In the book, the slaves were all kinds of races, but in the show, the scene was filmed in Morocco with the crowd made of entirely of locals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> plays with this trope in the third season. Oliver takes on the League of Assassins, a Middle Eastern guild of warriors who all take Arabic titles, where his superior skills lead to him essentially playing out this trope: He becomes the next in line for leadership and is set to marry the leader's daughter. However, the leader himself is white, having been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty Whitey</a> himself who took leadership centuries ago, who seems to be invoking this trope by electing to position Oliver, an outsider, as his heir, and forces his daughter, who is a lesbian, to marry Oliver against her will to ensure that the eventual heir is still a blood descendant. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's Malcolm, another white outsider, who takes leadership...but not through his own skill, but rather through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> and making a deal with Oliver.</span>

The only reason Danny was able to become the best fighter at K'un-Lun was that he dedicated himself to nothing but training to cope with the trauma of being orphaned and marooned there after his family's plane crash. Additionally, the other students of K'un-Lun, all of whom are indigenous to the region, are <em>furious</em> that not only did an outsider of a different race best them and obtain the power of the Iron Fist, but that he abandoned the region to return to America at the first opportunity, effectively forsaking the duty and tradition of the post. In the second season it's further revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danny didn't win the powers of the Iron Fist because he was the strongest or most worthy candidate, but rather because the actual strongest, Davos, had the all-important duel rigged against him, thus meaning that Danny simply happened to be in the right place at the right time</span>. Though it does become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a> since Danny <em>did</em> have to become strong enough to face-off and defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Shou-Lao</a>, a creature described as infinite, in order to gain the Iron Fist.

The Europeans arrive in Zululand to establish diplomatic ties and trading rights, and Dr. Henry Flynn points out that an unscrupulous person with their superior technology could become a god in this country, but it turns out that King Shaka is a dangerous, cunning ruler who has them totally at his mercy throughout their stay, and they're effectively political hostages. This small collection of mostly western civilians does manage to oppose an army of 20,000 enemy soldiers with a few rifles and a cannon, and Shaka becomes convinced that they possess the secret to immortality (actually hair dye that makes him appear younger and more medical knowledge to nurse him back to health after an attempted assassination). When Lieutenant Farewell returns from Capetown, his meeting with Shaka after the King has experienced a mental breakdown because of the death of his mother, in particular, is a very bitter take on this trope, as Shaka likens himself to a simple monkey who allowed himself to be tricked into getting his hand trapped in a bottle containing something shiny.

The Primarchs were the Emperor's twenty clone-sons, who were scattered across the galaxy and became (with the exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Angron</a>) legendary leaders on their adopted homeworlds. But when someone is a gene-enhanced demigod with physical, intellectual and in some cases psychic powers well beyond those of mortal men, this is only to be expected. The degree to which the Primarchs integrated into their homeworlds also varied - Fulgrim reversed a dying world's decline and allowed a cultural renaissance, Leman Russ and Jaghatai Khan became barbarian conquerors, Guilliman simply led an already spacefaring civilization into a golden age of expansion, while Konrad Curze was little more than a vigilante killer who ruled the populace by fear. As an aside, while most of the Primarchs were white, several had darker skin tones, two were freakishly pale, Vulkan's skin was pitch black, and Magnus the Red, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">well...</a>
<ul><li> The trope is played mostly straight in some of the Primarchs' backstories when the Emperor arrived to collect them. In many cases, they immediately recognized and swore fealty to their father, but in others, they impressed the locals and only won their sons over after competing with and besting them at various challenges. This is particularly true in Vulkan's story since he and Nocturne's people were puzzled by the "pale outlander" who appeared before them. That said, the Emperor was actually from ancient Anatolia, so "pale" is relative here.

</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of fighting games, Ken in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> Universe is born to a rich white father and a Japanese mother. Compared to his best friend and rival Ryu, he is the most out-going and coolest. However, it's how he's portrayed in the American animated TV series that qualifies him for savior status. By the final season, Ken is given the title greatest martial artist of all time and the only one who can beat Akuma. Interestingly enough, the Anime motion picture would avert this, by making Ken a victim of Bison, and Ryu being the only one who can save him. And let's not forget the live motion picture, which portrays Guile - played by Jean Claude Van Dam - as the hero and savior, when in the fighting game universe, he's not a main character. Ken and Ryu, who are the main characters, are portrayed as traveling con-artist who get in over their heads.
<ul><li> Ryu spends every moment of his life wandering the world to challenge the greatest fighters he can find and hone his martial arts. He breathes, eats, sleeps, and craps his style 24 hours a day. Ken, on the other hand, spends a wild time in American nightlife, gets married, has a kid, and lives life like a rich guy. He practices martial arts to avoid getting rusty, but nowhere near the level Ryu does. When Ken and Ryu fight, it's often described that Ryu is better... but not by a whole much, and Ken can give Ryu a serious workout.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> universe, Terry and Andy Bogard are white boys adopted by Jeff Bogard and taught his martial arts style.

In the anime movies, Terry is always portrayed as the strong, silent hero while the highest-profile Asian character from the games, Joe Higashi, is relegated to comic relief.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a>,</em> with Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom. "Mighty Whitey" is his mantra, and he's a card-carrying supremacist through and through dedicated to "educating" the locals (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> of Ancient China) primarily by shooting challengers with his musket. The one person he has "enlightened" is a guy he renamed "Percival" and made his squire, who sees it more as a job than anything. Your character is given the mission of humbling so he'll finally stop bothering everyone by first defeating him in a debate (where he does at least raise some worthwhile points) and then in a duel. Once defeated, however, he's gracious enough that he'll offer up a reward and be on his way.
<ul><li> One of the reward for fighting him is his Tactical Manual, a treatise on the art of warfare which gives you a bonus to your fighting ability by teaching you what <em>not</em> to do. Another "reward" is a manual on trepanation, which has your character noting that this goes against every known medical practice in the land and so must be metaphorical. Or his gun Mirabelle, one of the best weapons in the game once upgraded.

Somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in not everyone studies their own history extensively; simply being of Native American descent wouldn't automatically grant him in-depth knowledge and Kane had actually researched the subject. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turok also ultimately proves to be a superior warrior to Kane when he defeats him in a knife fight after Kane turns out to be an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>.</span>

In the first game, displaced human Kyle Brennan (a white man) is stranded in the X universe and, over the course of the series, contributes to the near-defeat of a race of genocidal robot ships, builds up a massive and influential R&amp;D company in the hopes of finding a way back to Earth, uncovers the true nature of the Kha'ak, and through his actions eventually sets in motion the reunion between Earth and the rest of the universe. Terran Conflict plays this trope in a mechanical sense in that Terran ships — which are often faster, better shielded, and more destructive than anything else in the X universe — range from a bright polished platinum color to near-pure white.

</li><li> In 1511 a Spanish ship sunk off the coast of the Yucatan. Those who didn't die in the shipwreck or from thirst before reaching the coast were enslaved by the natives, sacrificed or worked to death, except for a friar, Gerónimo de Aguilar, and a soldier, Gonzalo Guerrero. Guerrero won his freedom after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">saving his owner from a crocodile</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">embraced Mayan culture and religion</a>, and rose rapidly in rank until he married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter">The Chief's Daughter</a>. When Cortés passed through the place on his way to Mexico and offered the two men to join his army, Aguilar readily took the offer but Guerrero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay">chose to stay</a> with his wife and three children. By the beginning of Montejo's conquest of the Yucatan in 1528, Guerrero was the <em>Nacom</em> (General) of the army of Chetumal. Montejo tried to win Guerrero to his side but once again he refused, and instead led the Mayas to several victories using both Mayan surprise guerrilla tactics and Spanish anti-cavalry phalanx tactics that he had learned while serving in Italy decades before. He was killed in battle in Honduras in 1536, of an arquebus shot to the chest, but Montejo had to concede defeat and it was his son who finally managed to control Yucatan a decade later. Given his ridiculously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic">troperiffic</a> life, it is incredible that Guerrero's story has never been adapted to film.
</li><li> The history of the Tanegashima matchlock musket is this trope. In 1543 a few Portuguese reached a Japanese island when the Chinese ship they were on had to take shelter during a storm. The local ruler, Tanegashima Tokitaka, bought two matchlock muskets from them and set a swordsmith on reproducing them. At the time, the Japanese had both crossbows and primitive hand cannons, so reproducing one of the most advanced firearms then available wasn't too hard... except for one little thing. The matchlocks they bought used a screwed-in bolt to seal the breach which could also be unscrewed for both cleaning and to remove things stuck in the barrel (before that, something getting stuck in the barrel rendered it permanently unusable). The Japanese didn't know how to make the grooves on the outside of a metal bolt match the grooves on the inside of a metal barrel until the Portuguese returned the next year and a blacksmith showed them the trick.
</li><li> Played remarkably straight in the case of the White Rajahs of Sarawak. English adventurer Sir James Brooke was granted the title of Rajah of Sarawak by the Sultan of Brunei, as a reward for his efforts in combating piracy in Malaysia. To the surprise and fascination of many, Brooke forged Sarawak into an independent sovereign state, introducing a modern system of government and efficient civil service. Although there were some western influences (Brooke invited a number of Anglican missionaries to set up schools), he made a determined effort to preserve the local culture and led the natives into battle against local pirates on several occasions. When Sarawak was absorbed into the British Empire after WWII, many locals objected and sought the restoration of the Brooke Dynasty because they felt the White Rajahs had been one of the most effective barriers to western colonisation. When the British withdrew from Sarawak in 1963 it was promptly absorbed into Malaysia, but to this day, the Brookes are still remembered with considerable fondness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> tells of T. E. Lawrence. It would be an exaggeration to say he alone put together a loose band of irregular tribesman that threw back the better-armed, better-equipped, much-more-powerful Ottoman Turks by mastering desert warfare on a level that amazed even his Arab irregulars, and thus was directly responsible for weakening the Ottoman Empire critically and thus changing the entire strategic balance in the First World War...but it would not be a <em>gross</em> exaggeration.
</li><li> Came about in China during the late medieval era, when the Mongol hordes (famously led by Genghis Khan) overran most of the Middle Kingdom and subjugated the Chinese people. They soon found themselves having to establish a bureaucratized government for the sake of continuity with the "Mandate of Heaven" (the ruling authority of all of China's imperial dynasties)...but being basically barbarians up to this point, the Mongols had none of the experience - and very little of the knowledge - necessary to serve as government leaders. Nor could they conscript ethnic Chinese to fill the role of civil servants, for the Chinese people were sullen under their conquerors and would surely try to sabotage their rule. So the Mongols <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Took A Third Option</a>: while a Mongol Khan continued to reign as Emperor of China, he filled his government offices with people who were neither Mongolian nor Chinese - and sometimes were not even Asian. Quite a few European traders, explorers, and missionaries wound up working as Chinese bureaucrats.

Their efforts are generally considered instrumental in the Qing dynasty's eventual victory. Most notably, the most famous commander of the group, the British officer Charles George Gordon ("Chinese Gordon") was lavished with honors by the Qing for his service.
</li><li> Subverted by the "Mad Khan", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanVonUngernSternberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanVonUngernSternberg">Roman von Ungern-Sternberg</a>. He was a Russian-German Count, a very colourful person, eccentric to the point of lunacy, and known for his wanton cruelty. In the turmoil of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Russian Revolution,</a> he carved himself a state in Outer Mongolia, claiming to be "the Last Khan" and reincarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>. He managed to keep the Mongols down and the Chinese out, but things went south quickly when the Soviets came and he was defeated, captured and executed.
</li><li> According to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Fredegar">Chronicle of Fredegar,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samo">Samo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Frankish merchant who united a number of West Slavic tribes against the raiding Avars (called Huns in the chronicle), was acclaimed as their king, and led the resulting empire successfully against an invasion from his fellow Franks.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> series really tends to point it out: For so many supposedly international organizations, there sure are a hell of a lot of Japanese people compared to any other ethnicity.
<ul><li> And they sometimes double up on it, with a large percentage of the non-Japanese characters being American. Some games in the series, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Alpha</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsCompact2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsCompact2">Compact 2/Impact</a></em>, will pair the two together.

</li><li> Not to mention Latooni (... well, Latun, as a proper romanization of the way her name is written), who is one of the best pilots in the game (can easily compete with Raidiese for 'ace of the younger generation') - she's <em>Russian</em>.

In fact, a rival ruler is trying to prevent one of them from rising to power because he fears the success that he believes is inevitable if the rival nation is ruled by someone from Japan.

Although Shintarou often tries to introduce elements of his own culture, it usually either goes terribly wrong or is revealed to have already existed in some way on the island. Shintarou, throughout the story, is also relegated to the role of housekeeper for Papuwa, the only other human on the island at his arrival, who is a young boy...and much stronger than Shintarou.
</li><li> In a rather odd example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s <em>Phoenix: Sun</em> is about a <em>Korean</em> soldier who flees to Japan after his kingdom is defeated by the Tang Dynasty forces &amp; eventually becomes a feudal lord &amp; a major player in the historical Jinshin War. In a bit of a subversion, he is also invited to join a tribe of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a> Shinto wolf-spirits (because his face was cut off by the Chinese &amp; replaced with a wolf's) but declines because he feels he'd be a burden to them, having no supernatural powers of his own.
</li><li> A manga version of the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em> story, <em>Destiny Of An Emperor</em> (which was also made into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> knockoff RPG for the NES, which bizarrely enough managed to cross the Pacific), posits that historical warlord Lü Bu was, in fact, a blond European who had taken a Chinese name, thus explaining his historically-documented freakish height and strength. Hilariously, when applied to <em>Lü Bu</em> of all people it becomes a subversion of the trope, as Lü Bu was a lecher, a murderer, and betrayed everyone he ever met. He died alone and utterly ruined.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>, the girl who carries on the story of the Hittite Empire... is Yuri Suzuki, who is a full-blooded Japanese.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dragonball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dragonball">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s Goku fulfills this trope in the same way that Superman, listed below, does.

Kal-El learns the ways of the primitive Earth folk and ultimately becomes their greatest champion while inspiring them to bring out the best in their culture, and even turns against the race he was born to when they try to molest his new home with their advanced strength and weapons.

Because they'd never seen black skin before, they took him for a god, but he was quick to insist that he was just a man (he is their chieftain, however).

Travis is white, and while there are white-looking folks in Skartaris (including the villain Deimos), the Warlord's best friend in Skartaris is Machiste, who is black.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange">Adam Strange</a></em> comics used a concept nearly identical to the <em>John Carter Of Mars</em> books.

<ul><li> Popular comic author Alan Moore later subverted this by having the Rannians still treat Adam with contempt because they have superior intellects.

</li><li> Not strictly a non-white example, but not conventional: In Patrick Rothfuss's <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em>, Kvothe is a white man who learns the martial art of the <em>white</em> natives in a ridiculously short time.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> has two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> examples in the "Sith" and the "Mandalorians."
<ul><li> Until a few thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, the Sith were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">a Near-Human species</a> who hailed from the remote world of Korriban. They had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">red skin, yellow eyes, tentacled goatee beards, and various horns or spikes on assorted parts of their bodies</a>. Eventually some (Human) Dark Jedi came to live with them, intermarried and interbred with them (lightening their skin a good deal and removing their tentacles and horns from the gene pool in the process), learned their language and absorbed their culture, and fused the Sith religion with their own "Dark Side" Force doctrines to create the order of the Dark Lords of the Sith, who became the greatest foreign enemy of the Old Republic and later served (and headed!) the Galactic Empire. Today, racially pure Sith are pretty much extinct (basically the only remnant is that some humans now have red skin), and the name has been appropriated by evil Humans and other non-Korribanese species with Dark Jedi talents.
</li><li> The original Mandalorians were genetically drawn from the Taung, a race of monkey-like humanoids who once lived on Coruscant; they were defeated in ancient times by the Human warriors of the Battalions of Zhell, whereupon they fled Coruscant and escaped to the far-off world of Roon, only to relocate to a slightly less distant planet near the Gordian Reach. There the Taung war chief, Mandalore, lent his name to both the newly-colonized world and to his people and their warrior culture. As time passed, the Taung-descended Mandalorians began allowing Humans and other species to emigrate to Mandalore - and ironically, the "pure" Mandalorians eventually relocated to yet another planet. The process started out with Humans other non-Taung species being adopted by Taung Mandalorians; while family ties are essential to Mandalorians, they make no distinction between blood relatives and adopted ones, something which continued to be central to Mandalorian culture even after the original Taung descendants were gone. This departure left non-Taung in control of Mandalore, and these other species remade the order in their own image, resulting thousands of years later in Human Mandalorians such as Journeyman Protector Jaster Mereel, Jango Fett and his son Boba, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Sabine Wren</a>. For comparison, imagine if modern-day (non-Native) Americans completely absorbed and internalized the American Indian way of life, began dressing in Indian garb, and called themselves "Indians" without any irony whatsoever.

Humans are much better at the actual business of ruling, and thus constitute a disproportionate percentage of long-reigning monarchs within fairyland.

When the White Witch is defeated, the natives joyfully accept the children as their kings and queens.

He (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">She, starting from Series 11</a>) is a Time Traveling alien who originally looked down on other species, until becoming enamoured with the universe, in particular his/her favourite planet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthIstheCenterofTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthIstheCenterofTheUniverse">Earth</a>.

By the way, Sisko was black, while the majority of the Bajoran people were played by white people.
