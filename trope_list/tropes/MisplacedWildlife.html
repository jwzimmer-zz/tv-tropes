It can manifest several different ways.
</p><p>Generally, filmmakers use whichever animals they can get for a scene involving wild animals, especially in films set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica">Darkest Africa</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAmazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAmazon">The Amazon</a>. Whether the animals are in the right environment, on the right continent or displaying appropriate behaviour is something they just hope we won't ask about. Other times, cultural assumptions can lead to animals being placed in the wrong environments even when technical limitations aren't a strict factor.
</p><p>This can qualify as a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">biology fail</a> in cases where the animal wouldn't even be able to <em>survive</em> in the environment where it's depicted, never mind being in the wrong place. Fishes are perhaps the most common victims of this, as when freshwater species such as piranha or electric eels are shown living in the ocean, where salinity ought to kill them in minutes. Likewise, for any depiction of saltwater-dependent organisms such as octopuses or great white sharks living and menacing victims in fresh water.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Particularly common examples include:
</p><dl><dd><ul><li> Asian elephants in scenes set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica">Darkest Africa</a>, since African elephants are notoriously difficult to train, and the only trained elephants available thus tend to be Asian.
</li><li> Monkeys. The cutest monkeys, the ones with the round faces and prehensile tails, are exclusive to the New World. Old World monkeys have long, wrinkly, often brightly colored faces and bare, often colourful, butts with non-prehensile (most macaques, baboons and the colobus) or vestigial (some macaques, the drill and mandrill) tails, so any film in Africa or Asia featuring a cute little monkey hanging by its tail will annoy a naturalist like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespearean</a> costume at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>'s court annoys an English historian.
</li><li> Lions are grassland-, desert- and woodland-dwelling animals, but older literature often places them in the depths of the African rainforest. Tigers may sometimes be found in Africa as well, despite being strictly Asian animals. These cases have become rather rare in modern works, however, and are rarely used in non-parodic manners anymore.
</li><li> Scary things like snakes and spiders will consist of whatever the pet store had in stock. Never mind where these animals live. Never mind if they're even really dangerous either.
</li></ul></dd></dl><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Misidentified wildlife is another feature of this trope. This tends to happen to birds a lot. Some movies show a bird making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyNature">generic ambient noise type calls</a>, usually via stock footage. This ruins any sense of immersion for birdwatchers, who will immediately ask, "Hey, what's a White-throated Sparrow doing in feudal Japan?" Indeed one will eventually come away with the impression that there are no birdwatchers in Hollywood. (In extreme cases, such as using <a class="urllink" href="https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?taxonCode=rethaw&amp;mediaType=a&amp;sort=rating_rank_desc&amp;q=Red-tailed%20Hawk">a red-tailed hawk's scream<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to represent an "eagle," this has crossed over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">The Coconut Effect</a>.)
</p><p>Occasionally, a movie or TV show will attempt to justify Misplaced Wildlife by identifying an animal onscreen, such as that White-throated Sparrow, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">something ''completely'' different</a> — even if it's a species that looks nothing like the creature onscreen.
</p><p>Also, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoisyNature">background sound effects</a> contain sounds of animals not native to the setting of the film/TV show. Perhaps the most notorious example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunglesSoundLikeKookaburras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunglesSoundLikeKookaburras">Jungles Sound Like Kookaburras</a>, the use of the distinctive "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXA0-YAoo9Q">laugh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianWildlife">Australian kookaburra</a> in jungle scenes set in Africa, or anywhere else other than Australia. This began with MGM's early-30s jungle movies like <em>Tarzan, the Ape Man</em>, and ever since, <strong>everybody</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">has used this sound as jungle background</a>.
</p><p>Naturally, this trope occurs much less often when the filming actually takes place in the area where the story is set. Also, this trope generally applies only to normal animals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animals</a> can be easily called as immigrants of some sort if found out of their element (especially if they're able to build vehicles). A few cases might be explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">Creator Provincialism</a>, as the creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow">incorporate the animals they're most familiar with</a>.
</p><p>Note that this trope can also occur with plant life. In fact, it occurs often enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation">Misplaced Vegetation</a> is its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope">Sister Trope</a>.

<ul><li> Averted in the Coke commercials with the polar bear family for almost a decade, until a 2006 commercial. Possibly justified in that the penguins are on vacation, as they float in on patches of ice.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-bQsbrGs4">the Snickers Feast ads<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a Viking and a pilgrim, the Viking's headdress is made partially from the hide of raccoons, which are specific to the Western Hemisphere. He could have been a Viking who traveled to North America, but it's doubtful that the makers of the commercials thought about that.
</li><li> There's a Hyundai commercial with a car driving past a lot of wild animals that are impressed by its look. Most of them are common North American forest species, but there's also prairie dogs (which don't belong in the woods), plus lemurs and an emu (which don't even belong on the same continent as the rest, or each other).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Geico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Geico">GEICO</a>:
<ul><li> One commercial shows African penguins living in the South Pole. As their name suggests, African penguins are only found along the southern African coast and wouldn't be able to survive the extreme environment of the Antarctic. African penguins are a common captive species, so they were most likely the easiest to book for a commercial shoot.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjHK2Uczq7o">Another ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows some children playing the game "Marco Polo" in a backyard pool with the historical Marco Polo. A llama stands by the pool watching the game for some reason... presumably (since it's wearing a pack) because the commercial's writers didn't know that they're from the wrong continent for Polo to have ever used one on his travels.
</li><li> Another ad shows a pair of cartoon turtles get menaced by a white-backed vulture, which is an African species. Due to laws regarding native birds of prey, it's likely that it was simply easier to get than a turkey vulture.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified for the joke in an ad video of the Austrian tourism ministry as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the stupid tourists who can't distinguish them from Australia.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MomotarosDivineSeaWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MomotarosDivineSeaWarriors">Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors</a></em>, the little island where the Japanese build their base contains elephants, rhinos, kangaroos, and crocodiles, none of which are found in the islands of the southwest Pacific. In fact, animals that large aren't found on small islands, period.
</li><li> More of a translation problem, but nearly every animal in an anime referred to as a raccoon is in reality a raccoon dog (or <em>tanuki</em>), a completely unrelated animal. Raccoons are native to the Americas. Some, like the one below, may be referring to actual raccoons since they are an invasive species now found in 42 out of 47 prefectures.
</li><li> <em>Rascal the Raccoon</em> is a 1977 anime series with a main character that is a raccoon. At the time it was very popular, leading to around 1,500 raccoons that were imported as pets each year after the success of the anime series, so it became something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>.
</li><li> The main island of Japan hosts a sort of urban-dwelling dove similar to a morning dove with a very distinctive call: <em>hoot-hoot / low grumble.</em> This call is heard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em> even though the beginning of the story is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> has, among other things, tigers in Africa. When the author found out that tigers don't <em>live</em> in Africa, he admitted to not doing the research... and then, since it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>, lampshaded it in a flashback in a later chapter by portraying an African savanna with such diverse species as pandas, unicorns, dinosaurs, and a "dragon" that looks rather like a person in a costume.
</li><li> This is brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Petshop of Horrors: Tokyo</a></em>, in a chapter where D points out to Wu Fei that many of the animals that are considered normal in Japan were actually imported from other countries.
</li><li> The Jungle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu">Haré+Guu</a></em> contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign">oddly drawn bears</a>. The manga even says in a small box <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">"Note: there are no bears in the jungle."</a> Said jungle also seems to have pokute as its primary form of wildlife, so...
</li><li> Part of Goku and Krillen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff">training</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> involves swimming ten laps between the shore of a lake that for some reason has a shark in it.
</li><li> The "Best Wishes" arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime featured Pikachu in the Unova region, which ironically did not feature such Pokémon (or <em>any</em> Pokémon from the first four generations) there. This was only because Ash brought the Pikachu with him; there had yet to be any appearances of the 493 Pokémon from prior generations in the wild. There were also instances of certain Pokémon appearing in a region in which they're normally not native to, especially during both the Hoenn and Sinnoh arcs.

At least they put a leopard in the place of the book's lion, which, given the jungle setting, is much more appropriate. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">Licensed Game</a> on the other hand, turns this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Most of the enemies Tarzan has to avoid are misplaced, from South American toucans, macaws and squirrel monkeys to <em>piranhas</em> (yes, the game plays this example straight after the movie it's based on parodies it). The ring-tailed lemurs return from the movie, as do the vicious baboons; they're some of the <em>only</em> African enemies encountered. <em>Tarzan 2</em> features giraffes, wildebeests, and gazelles in the jungle. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfTarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfTarzan">The Legend of Tarzan</a></em> had blue-and-yellow macaws and bald eagles (or perhaps the very similar-looking African fish eagle, which still doesn't live in jungles) in Africa, as well as the ring-tailed lemurs from the movie. There's also savannah animals like the aforementioned giraffes, zebras, spotted hyenas, and briefly what looked like a lioness (even after the original movie averted this) living in the jungle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King (1994)</a></em> came close to avoiding this trope. That would be if it only wasn't for a line of leaf-cutting ants, native to South America. "I Just Can't Wait to be King" also features what appear to be spider monkeys (also South America) and anteaters (though perhaps they were meant to be aardvarks), though since it's the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence">Disney Acid Sequence</a>, it's debatable how much it counts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride">The sequel</a> also slips up by putting an exclusively rainforest-dwelling Okapi in the savanna although it <em>is</em> an African species, just from the wrong part of Africa. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingOneAndAHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingOneAndAHalf">The midquel</a> also has Timon mentioning snapping turtles, even though those live in North America. And then there's the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> version of <em>The Lion King,</em> which for some reason, featured tigers living in what appears to be Africa.

The opening scene also featured a <em>Koolasuchus</em>, which was a giant amphibian that <em>only</em> thrived in polar regions (the South Pole, to be precise, on the exact opposite part of the planet). Even taking tectonic shift into account, those didn't belong there.
</li><li> The film at least <em>tries</em> to justify the Baylene and the carnotaurs by saying that the former is the last of her kind and that the latter are never found as far north as the apparent setting of the film, saying that they must have been driven out by the meteor.

(The animals were cast based on the characters' personalities—King Richard the Lionheart is a lion; cunning Robin Hood is a fox, etc.) Although it is set in a world of sapient animals so it's not unreasonable to assume all these creatures immigrated from their ancestral homelands over time.

The brown bear's Asian range does <em>barely</em> extend into China, so it's not completely misplaced, but the movie is still set in the wrong part of China.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Mulan">The original</a> stuck to Chinese wildlife, but forgot that China is a gigantic country whose wildlife varies a great deal by region. Thus we see a giant panda (native to Sichuan province in the southwest) even though the plot revolves around fighting the Huns, who lived in <em>northern</em> China. That is like including jaguars (which <em>are</em> found in the United States, but in southwestern ones like Arizona) in, say, Maine.

At the very least, they used animals that were all around after the dinosaurs died out (with the exception of the second film's hesperornithines, mostly flightless Mesozoic diving birds). Especially confusing the mains haven't aged between the two movies, but they're set at opposite ends of the titular ice age... And then comes <em>Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs</em>, when the first movie had <em>humans</em>. The dinosaurs are at least living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld">Lost World</a>, but the genera there are as misplaced in location and time as the other animals in the series.

Although American animals such as the possum and grey fox are present, this could just very well be an artistic choice on the director's part. After all, some of the animals that could have more easily been represented by their American counterparts, such as the badger, were instead obviously portrayed as the Eurasian variety — fitting as the film is set in the English countryside. Some believe that because the animals are all portrayed as American, and the humans as English, the film could represent the American Revolution... in which case, is it acceptable for a few of the animals to be American species, if a theme of the film is all about said animals/culture fighting for their own identity?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> has an elderly Galapagos tortoise living in ancient China as one of the film's main characters, while the sequel featured evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla">gorillas</a> (native to Africa). The tortoise at least is justified, as his backstory has him being born in the Galapagos Islands and eventually traveling to China. In general, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> greatly averts this trope. Especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness">tv show</a>, where the wildlife is <em>so</em> accurate that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeldomSeenSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeldomSeenSpecies">probably won't recognize some of it</a>. In all fairness, the animals are highly anthropomorphized and live like humans. It's not unreasonable to suggest that, like humans, they moved around a lot, especially after acquiring new forms of transportation such as boats and carts.
</li><li> That cute little desert mouse, Priscilla, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rango">Rango</a></em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is she's actually an aye-aye. The film is set in the Mohave Desert, and the aye-aye is native only to <em>Madagascar</em>.
</li><li> The 1978 film <em>The Water Babies</em> has a (freshwater) electric eel working for a shark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> under the ocean, and lets its lobster, seahorse, and swordfish characters move freely into rivers.

And the bats working for the pure ones appear to be vampire bats, which are native to Central and South America.
</li><li> In the animated Christmas Movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spike">Spike</a></em> there's an entire village (more like a city) of penguins within driving distance of Santa's workshop.

</li><li> Disney's version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> skirts this trope. There are North American animals such as grizzly bears and African animals such as hippopotamuses, monkeys and rhinoceroses, living on the same continent, and also presumably within a few miles of each other — and in their native habitats, too. They (partly) justify it by implying (during Peter and the kids' flight from London) that Neverland exists in a separate solar system and thus is a different planet (which makes the pirates and the Indians examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a>). At least the crocodile doesn't stick out too badly, since crocodiles <em>are</em> found in the Caribbean, which is the kind of place you'd expect to encounter folks like Captain Hook and his crew. The sequel <em>Return to Neverland</em> also has lions and elephants on Neverland as well.

Even a layman should be able to figure out giant woolly animals wouldn't live anywhere near a desert, though in all fairness it's quite clear that they were deliberately captured and brought there for use as laborers just like the human slaves, not that they're actually native to the desert. Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend">Terror Birds</a> in the jungle, which were probably meant to be (South American) Phorusrhacids.

This may be a case of failing geography rather than biology, as they might've belatedly decided to change the film's location. There's also the deadly golden silk orb-weaver seen several times during the film. Impressively, it's not too out of place (<em>Nephila</em> is a very widespread genus, and there are several Asian species). On the other hand, it's not exactly deadly, as the many, <em>many</em> people who live with these things could easily tell you.
</li><li> The Transylvanian armadillos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula</a></em> (1931). There's also an opossum; Browning probably meant for them to stand in as giant rats, but still
<ul><li> The Spanish language version, shot from the same script on the same sets at night after the English-speaking cast and crew had gone home, does use rats. The director made a point of watching the English language footage every night before getting to work, and then making his version better. He didn't know what the armadillos were for, either.
</li><li> One theory is that the armadillos and opossums are actually a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">censorship</a>; showing actual live rats would have been against the rules as too "revolting" for an American audience, so rat stand ins were rather bizarrely used. The Spanish version would have been shown in areas where this limitation wouldn't have applied, so they got away with using real rats.
</li><li> As the Spanish-language version was intended for Latin American markets, much of its intended audience would know that armadillos (native to that part of the world) are harmless and nothing like rats. English-speaking audiences — at least, the ones outside of Texas — would be less likely to know how very inoffensive these animals are, so might (stress <em>might</em>) actually have found them a bit creepy.

</li><li> Also, the crocodiles that devour several Mooks, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mola Ram</span> in the climax, are American alligators, not any of the four Indian species, the saltwater crocodiles, mugger crocodiles, gharial or false gharial.

(And worse, they go to no effort to hide this — the little guy is labeled in the movie as a Capuchin.) Another one of its denizens is only half right.

In the novel, they were boars, so it was probably just a case of being unable to get a large animal of that sort passive enough to use in filming, especially since one shot involves a hominid angrily shoving a tapir aside.

To say nothing of the fact that real life pandas generally don't hunt large prey.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy">Troy</a></em> contains a moment where a llama is seen in the city of Troy, despite the fact that llamas are new-world animals and would never have been found in ancient Greece/Troy. Perhaps they intended it to be a related camel, which would have been plausible (if unlikely) for the time period and place, since presumably one could have wound up there via Arab traders. The same crowd scene has a cage filled with budgerigars (commonly called parakeets in the US). These are small Australian parrots that weren't discovered until the 19th Century.
</li><li> Rare case of Old World monkeys in the New World: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown">The Rundown</a></em> the characters are twice sexually pestered by baboons in South America.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> the Persian war rhino is an African two-horned rhino instead of one of the one-horned Asian species (granted, there is a two-horned rhino in Asia, the Sumatran rhino, but it is a hairy, very small creature with two very short, almost flat horns). Also, rhinos never were domesticated nor used in warfare.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby">Bringing Up Baby</a></em> has a leopard from South America. Leopards are old world cats, found in Africa and Asia. South America is the domain of jaguars. The original short story identified Baby as a "panther" (i.e. jaguar), but a leopard happened to be available for filming, so the species was changed but they forgot to change her origin in the script (or more likely, didn't realise they had to).
</li><li> The spiders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arachnophobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arachnophobia">Arachnophobia</a></em> are <em>Delena cancerides</em> from New Zealand, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099052/trivia">a species known for being slow and harmless<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is somewhat evident to the arachnology fan watching the film, as they are so slow and inert that they sometimes have to be urged to move by sticks that are visible in-shot. The "big bad" spider toward the end is a bird-eating tarantula, more dangerous owing to being large and aggressive (if not particularly venomous). The film is set in the USA, though the spiders supposedly come from South America.
</li><li> The "venomous snakes" in the temple in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns">The Mummy Returns</a></em> are mainly coral snake mimics. Coral snakes and their mimics live in the Americas, not in Egypt. If you're using prop or CG snakes <em>anyway</em> (and they were, at least when snakes were being kicked or thrown around) there is really no excuse for them to be Misplaced Wildlife. Probably intentional, given writer/director Stephen Sommers' love for 1930s films in all their absurdity. In the same movie, there's Meela's "Egyptian asp." It's a Mexican black kingsnake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a></em> is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAntarctica">Mysterious Antarctica</a> and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare">Cat Scare</a> involving a penguin.

</li><li> Oddly enough, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tarzan">Tarzan</a></em> movie had Asian elephants disguised as African by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">attaching cardboard tusks and ears to them</a>. They got rid of the disguise in the sequels. This was probably done because African elephants are notoriously difficult to train.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jumanji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jumanji">Jumanji</a></em>. The jungle that the Jumanji world is composed of is not a real-world environment, but a fantastical, magical creation of the game, hence all sorts of misplaced wildlife spring from it. For instance, Pelicans, lions, black rhinos, zebras, and African bush elephants all don't live in the jungle. This carries over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JumanjiWelcomeToTheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JumanjiWelcomeToTheJungle">Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</a></em>.

It's presence is a two-fold mistake, because a) piranhas are found in South America, and b) they are fresh water fish. (This is for pure humour, but the writers could have picked a crab or anything more appropriate for the setting.

The film takes place on an island off the coast of South Carolina, while Komodo dragons live in Indonesia. A bunch of Komodo eggs were left on the island by someone back in the 70s, causing the Komodos to show up there. It still doesn't explain how they could survive that long in a radically different climate.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8p73d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8p73d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8p73d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The dragon's native islands have a tropical wet-and-dry climate, with essentially all of the rain falling between November and April.

It doesn't matter: the variety of jungle animals the Phantom encounters is such that wherever it is there's at least one animal that doesn't belong.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJungleBook2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJungleBook2016">The Jungle Book (2016)</a></em>:
<ul><li> India covers a wide range of climates, ecosystems, and biogeographic regions. Consequently, you can throw in a whole bunch of animals that are all found in India, yet don't actually meet each other in the wild. <em>The Jungle Book</em> is set in Seeonee (more typically spelt Seoni) in the state of Madhya Pradesh, central India. A number of Indian wildlife depicted in the movie aren't native to this area itself, such as Indian rhinoceros and pygmy hog (both more typical of the grasslands of the northern and northeastern states), as well as a great deal of the various primate species that make up the Bandar-log.
</li><li> Among the Bandar-log, the gibbons are presumed to be western hoolock gibbons, the only gibbon species native to India (the eastern hoolock gibbon might also be present in eastern Arunachal Pradesh). However, it is only found in the northeastern part of India, and does not share a range with the lion-tailed macaque, which is native to the <em>southwestern</em> part of India. Same goes for most of the other monkeys — the other macaque species represented appears to be a pig-tailed macaque, likely the northern pig-tailed macaque. There are also golden langurs and Nilgiri langurs. However, the northern pig-tailed macaque and golden langur are also found only in the northeastern states of India, and wouldn't have hung out with the lion-tailed macaques. The Nilgiri langur, like the lion-tailed macaque, is endemic to southwestern India. <em>None of these species are found in the Seoni area</em>. Only the gray langurs fit biogeographically — they're probably meant to be southern plains gray langur, which is the species native to central India. It's really odd that they chose a number of more exotic-looking monkey species that while Indian, don't occur in this area at all, while omitting the rhesus macaque, which <em>is</em> found in central India.
</li><li> The wolves themselves look quite out of place — they have the fur coats of wolves from more temperate climates. Indian wolves <a class="urllink" href="http://nickgarbutt.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/India-Mammals/G0000BlMrU48ZgOQ/I0000B6in36egOFY/C0000Mb2fkw2Qi.o">are much leaner and look quite different<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the European and North American wolves moviegoers are more familiar with.
</li><li> The flying squirrel species shown is a red and white giant flying squirrel, which is found in China, not India. There are various flying squirrel species in India, but they aren't as distinctively marked as this species.
</li><li> The jerboas, which show up at several points in the movie, must be quite lost; not only are they not found in India, they aren't even jungle inhabitants: they're found only in desert environments, and while some species are found in the arid parts of western Pakistan, that's the closest they ever get to Seoni.
</li><li> The frog seen hopping on the ground after the rains return does not look like any known species of frog from India. Instead, it appears to be an European tree frog.
</li><li> Among the sounds made by the Bandar-log include the calls of siamang, a gibbon species found in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, not in India, as well as <em>chimpanzees</em> (a species restricted to Africa).
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSoundEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSoundEffects">red-tailed hawk</a> (a predominantly North American species) is heard calling while Baloo and Bagheera are climbing the cliff in pursuit of the Bandar-log.
</li><li> The film is listed under aversions for turning King Louie, originally an orangutan, into a <em>Gigantopithecus</em>, for the explicit reason that orangutans don't live in India... which is just this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">on a temporal level instead of a geographical one</a>. <em>Gigantopithecus</em> lived in India, but has been extinct for 100,000 years or more. Our human protagonist would be far more likely to encounter an orangutan. That being said, a 12-foot-tall King Louie makes for an awesomely-staged scene, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> applies. It would have made more sense if Louie was still an orangutan, but was in India because he was an escapee from captivity.
</li><li> Even more egregiously, Baloo is, by all appearances, a grizzly bear. In India. Sloth bears, the literary character's species, simply don't have the good looks or badassery to lead a gritty reboot (although Bagheera and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> still identify Baloo as a sloth bear, regardless of how <a class="urllink" href="http://palaeofail-explained.tumblr.com/post/142517907556/so-to-answer-your-wondering-at-the-new-jungle">un-sloth bear-like he is<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the movie). The Himalayan subspecies of brown bear is found in India, but only in the northwestern Kashmir region, still a long, long way from Madhya Pradesh.
</li><li> During the credits, silhouettes of monkeys with prehensile tails and hummingbirds (both of which are restricted to the Americas) are shown.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the gags in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GirlShy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GirlShy">Girl Shy</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd">Harold Lloyd</a> sitting on a giant tortoise. Giant tortoises are currently found on islands in the south Pacific and Indian Oceans, not southern California.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash">Splash</a>.</em> Madison is supposed to be swimming around Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The problem is that she swims past coral reefs, and there are no coral reefs near Cape Cod since the water is too cold. Those scenes were actually filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBahamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBahamas">The Bahamas</a>.
</li><li> The trailer for <em>Alpha (2018)</em> shows long-horned bison, native only to North America, and woolly rhinoceroses, native to Europe. Regardless of where the film is supposed to be set, one of them is out of place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HawkTheSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HawkTheSlayer">Hawk the Slayer</a></em>.

</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeToTerabithia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeToTerabithia">Bridge to Terabithia</a></em> substituted a common brushtail possum for a Virginia opossum in the greenhouse scene. Necessitated because, although it's set in the eastern U.S., the film was produced in New Zealand, which has <em>very</em> strict laws against importing foreign wildlife. Brushtail possums aren't native to New Zealand either, but they have been established there as feral animals for a long time, so they could be filmed without breaking the law.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitches1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitches1990">The Witches (1990)</a></em>, there's a scene where a witch tries to lure Luke down from his treehouse with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLikeCreepyCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLikeCreepyCritters">a snake</a> she specifically says she found outside on the path. She's obviously lying, even more obviously if you know that it's a corn snake, a North American species that wouldn't be randomly slithering around in the UK.
</li><li> No actual wildlife is seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSuckers">The Suckers</a></em> (which, in itself, is odd for a movie about hunting), but George tells a story about Vandemeer lassoing a orangutan in Rhodesia, and Jeff claims to have hunted snow leopards in the Andes. Unless these animals escaped from zoos, they have no business being on those continents.
</li><li> Possibly occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LongWeekend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LongWeekend">Long Weekend</a></em>. The movie is implied to be taking place on the Victorian coast (Marcia's desire to visit Eildon makes it unlikely to be anywhere else), but one of the animals seen in is a Tasmanian devil, which are not found on the Australian mainland. However, this may not be an error as Lunda Beach is implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">not a normal location</a>

To Burroughs' credit, he realized the mistake and removed the tiger when the serialized <em>Tarzan of the Apes</em> was collected as a novel. The only other tiger to appear in the novels occurs in <em>Tarzan and the Foreign Legion</em> which is set on Sumatra, which does have tigers.
</li><li> Quite a few animals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> don't exactly run rampant in the Pacific Northwest.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson">The Swiss Family Robinson</a></em>, the characters are shipwrecked on a tropical island which is home to Eurasian buffalo and onagers, African lions, South American ocelots and boa constrictors, Australian kangaroos, and Antarctic penguins. The movie makes quite a spectacular attempt to justify this: the characters theorize that the island is all that's left of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtlas">a land bridge between continents</a>, and somehow representatives of every single place it reached got stuck there when the rest of the bridge eroded away. In this case it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>: before the theory of plate tectonics gave a plausible mechanism for continental drift, the idea that continents could <em>move</em> was considered fringe science, and land bridges were often invoked to explain similar fossils found oceans apart. The Disney film was a little better about it, but still had an Asian elephant calf (no parents ever seen), a Bengal tiger, African hyenas and zebras and cheetahs, South American spider monkeys, and the older brothers wrestle an anaconda (also a South American native).

Said spiders do not live this far to the west (we do have grass spiders with stripes vaguely reminiscent of the fiddleback, but the resemblance ends there), and they prefer a temperate climate.
<ul><li> In one of his short stories a South American boomslang is responsible for making the paramedics think the viewpoint character is dead.

There are some Black Bears in Southern Florida, but most are west of Dade.
</li><li> The complete opposite happens in the original <em>CSI</em> episode "Unbearable". Like in the above case, the episode opens with a hunter that has been killed by a bear (a Kodiak in this case). The fact the species is foreign is precisely what brings the CSI in since that makes the person who released the bear accountable for manslaughter, and the clues eventually lead to a zoo that has been selling animals for illegal hunts. <em>CSI Miami</em>'s take? The bear is treated the whole time as if it was native to the region, it's never clear why was the CSI brought in (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">though they find evidence of foul play immediately</a>) and the clues eventually lead to yet another murder of an attractive woman in an expensive hotel suite.

</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> example in the original series happens in "Evaluation Day", where an odd-proportioned skinned and mutilated body found in the desert turns out to be the remains of a poached gorilla.

At least <em>Jungle Fury</em> was originally planned to be named <em>Beast Fist</em>, so it made somewhat of a bit of sense. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em> and <em>Gaoranger</em> might better be considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>, since it's clear that the animals they chose were all over the place, jungle, desert, woodland, etc., and had no real one location, like a Jungle, Forest, etc. The only time Wildlife gets misplaced were with the animal-based weapons of the Jungle Sword (Lion, Tiger, Eagle, Shark, Bison) and Jungle Blaster (Falcon, Deer, Giraffe, Rhino, Armadillo.)

A bird that is played by <em>3 different species</em> over the course of the episode.

Then the awed Lucrezia asks if "beasts like this" live in Spain, and Juan cryptically answers "Not anymore." We never learn if he means American jaguars (which if anything would be more common in Spain then than ever before), wild big cats in general (which went extinct in Spain at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but he would not have a way to know about it, obviously) or captive big cats (which were actually common in Spanish menageries during the 15th century).

The elves had a good laugh and brought the lion to a pride on the plains, but she returned to their village and took to hanging out in the trees.

That just misses the wrong hemisphere, never mind continent. A more subtle mistake is the Komodo Dragon (a species native to islands in Indonesia).

However, <em>Dead Island</em> takes place in Banoi, a fictous island in Papua New Guinea — orangutans live only in Borneo and Sumatra, thousands of miles away. Making this even more bizarre, the orangutan lets out a stereotypical "mad gorilla" style roar, and the idea that one could contract the disease is rather suspect, given that an orangutan is hardly likely to consume human flesh.
</li><li> The PC game <em>Zoo Vet</em> and its sequel <em>Zoo Vet: Endangered Species</em> suffered from this (Oribi antelope in a temperate forest, Komodo dragons &amp; Chilean flamingos in a rainforest and even <em>bald eagles &amp; tokay geckos in a desert</em>).

The monsters you have to avoid being killed and eaten by are found on two different planets/moons: Sulon (a habitable moon of Sullust) and Ruusan, which are located in entirely different regions of the galaxy. Of course, it's possible that Jerec and his minions transported them from one location to another; but given that mailocs (gigantic wasps) and drugons (huge, man-eating fish) are both extremely dangerous and/or unwieldy, relocating them must not have been easy. Furthermore, the game also has Kumumgah (more famously known as Tusken Raiders or Sand People) turning up on Sulon, when any casual <em>Star Wars</em> fan could tell you that they are native to and only found on Tatooine. Of course, they <em>are</em> a (somewhat) intelligent species, but they're also nomadic herdsmen and warriors who wouldn't be likely to immigrate to another planet. Later games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Dark Forces Saga</a></em> would get better about this; particularly, Tusken Raiders only showed up one more time, on one of two Tatooine-set levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> give us the Yungoos line and the Alolan Rattata line, which are clearly based on mongoose and rats in Hawaii. Yungoos and Gumshoos are alien species to Alola that were introduced to the region in a misguided attempt to control the population of Rattata and Raticate, another line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> accidentally brought to Alola. This instead resulted in the Rattata and Raticate becoming nocturnal and adapting to night time to avoid the diurnal Yungoos and Gumshoos, resulting in <em>two</em> invasive species.

Route 30, in the original games, had a lake that was completely inaccessible due to trees blocking all access to it, but which had a clearing made in the remakes to let the player fish from and Surf over it. While you are still in the Route 30 portion of the map, freshwater Pokémon like Poliwag appear as they should in a small lake such as this - but water tiles have their possible encounters based on what area of the world they are in rather than being individually determined, so if you surf far South enough to pass into Cherrygrove City's portion of the map, you will suddenly start encountering ocean-bound Pokémon like Tentacool from this tiny freshwater lake, because the city's shore leading out into the ocean means its water was programmed to have oceanic Pokémon.

Even then, it could be justified because of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> where everything is all a computer simulation rather than the real-world with the Animus filling in animals that Edward was more familiar with for the similar African species.
<ul><li> The pattern is repeated in <em>Odyssey</em>, where you can find lions and leopards among more traditional European wildlife. It's stretching, but both species lived in Greece during the Pleistocene and lions, at least, survived there until the 1st century AD, though they became extinct in the Peloponnese c. 1000 BC. Like some of the other games, though, the exact placement of certain species still makes them misplaced—in the eastern parts of the in-game seas, you can find an island that has lions on it for some reason, along with a giant statue of Poseidon that presumably never existed in actual history.
<ul><li> In the same game, though, there's an acknowledged and in-universe example: when playing as Kassandra, it's possible to engage in an extensive hunting side quest which will eventually take you to the island of Kythira to kill the Krokottas Hyena. Once you begin the fight, Kassandra will directly remark that such animals aren't native to Greece (or at least to Kythira) and wonders how it even got there.

The creatures the native Talz are riding throughout the episode are Narglatch, fan-tailed cat-like creatures that are native to Naboo. Not only the wrong climate zone (Naboo is mostly tropical), but the wrong <strong>planet</strong>. What's even worse is the fact that since the Talz are not advanced enough to have space travel, so the appearance of the Narglatch could not be explained by the Talz having brought them to the planet. Furthermore, the Talz themselves are from another planet. This tends to happen a lot not only on <em>The Clone Wars</em>, but in the Star Wars universe in general.

In a more literal sense, the fact that most of the animals on the cast are <em>in the same shot</em>, centimetres apart from one another, is unusual. The wildlife placements are made far more odd when it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the series takes place in North America, where the Autobots' Ark crashed</span>. Even allowing for the prehistoric setting, many of the animals scanned in the first episode, as well as the proto-humans, are very out of place. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BeastWarsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BeastWarsII">Beast Wars II</a></em>, the Japan-only anime sequel, has at least one Tasmanian Devil on Gaea, which is Earth in the distant future.

<ul><li> Real Life Misplaced Wildlife is a <em>serious</em> problem as it can potentially create an invasive species. Someone brings over an exotic pet and either releases it when it's too much trouble or it escapes on its own, eventually finding a mate of similar background and reproducing. Depending on what animal it is, the climate, lack of predators, and abundance of prey that doesn't know how to avoid/escape them means they flourish well above what they do in their native territory, becoming a nuisance at best and a threat to humans at worst. Though this isn't always bad, as moving animals to new climates without natural predators has saved some species from extinction.
</li><li> In the Californian city of Martinez, there's a local legend about a group of monkeys living in the creek. They even have a restaurant named after them.
</li><li> There's a stable population of ring necked parakeets in South Eastern England, London, and other European cities such as Madrid—it's not uncommon to see trees covered in the little green birds as well as with their spherical nests in such places as Ramsgate or the Casa de Campo in the latter.
</li><li> Thanks to notorious Drug Lord Pablo Escobar, there is now a small population of hippos in Colombia.
</li><li> Beavers were introduced to the southern yup of South America in an attempt to start a fur industry. The industry never took off, but the beavers made themselves at home.
</li><li> Birds occasionally fly to places they aren't normally seen in, such as Siberian birds in Alaska or American birds in Europe, due to being blown off course by strong winds during their migration. That said, this is such a rare occurrence, it tends to make the news and draw eager birdwatchers from all over the country.
<ul><li> Eurasian Eagle Owls, which are thought to have been native to the United Kingdom at some point in the past, have recently been making a sudden comeback thanks to occasional vagrants and deliberate releases or escapes of pet owls.
</li><li> And it doesn't just happen to birds either. A West Indian Manatee (more readily associated with Florida) spent his summer in Cape Cod in 2008.

</li><li> Pasadena, California has a large, non-indigenous population of naturalized parrots. According to the "Parrot Project of Los Angeles", the parrots are of at least five species. Some residents have come to enjoy the birds as part of their unique city's culture, while others consider them to be loud pests. Many theories surround the mystery of how the parrots landed in Pasadena and claimed the area as their own. A widely accepted story is that they were part of the stock that were set free for their survival from the large pet emporium at Simpson's Garden Town on East Colorado Boulevard, which burned down in 1959.

Technically these are "introduced" rather than misplaced — they were released as pets or escaped on their own and have become feral versus winding up in the wrong place due to some natural phenomenon. This is unfortunately pretty common, as evidenced by the <em>European</em> Starling being ubiquitous across North America and the also European House Sparrow now being one of the most numerous birds on the continent, despite the latter's declining numbers in countries it is native to according to its article on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a>. Amazingly, both of these species were only introduced to North America in the last 150 years or so. A story mentioning flocks of House Sparrows in New York City would have qualified for this trope as being wrong not that long ago.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_pheasant">Ring-necked Pheasant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, so beloved of American hunters and artists and also the state bird of South Dakota, was brought to North America in 1857. They are originally native to Russia and are also naturalized in much of Western Europe.
</li><li> The common parakeet, or budgie, has been marching, proverbially, into the Netherlands driving out the native Sparrow (which as mention above is doing just fine in its non-native North American habitats).
</li><li> The Rock Pigeon<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107uos');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107uos" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107uos');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or Rock Dove as it was called before ornithologist organizations adopted a name more consistent with the bird more often informally being called a pigeon than a dove</span> ended up this way due to human intervention. The species's adaptability combined with feral populations ending up on every continent except for Antarctica ended up giving birds that originally lived on European cliffs a very wide range, to the point where their non-native status outside their original range isn't brought up much due to how common and widespread they are, as well as the fact that these countries often have their own native species of doves and pigeons, in contrast to how the House Sparrow and European Starling stand out in North America since their families are mostly restricted to the Old World; although the Americas have species called sparrows, they're actually in the same family as Old World buntings<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ajkb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ajkb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ajkb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Details on the page for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallASmeerpARabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallASmeerpARabbit">Call a Smeerp a "Rabbit"</a></span>. The fact that Rock Pigeons outside their native habitat are descended from domesticated specimens also results in varying colors among individuals.

While not nearly as threatening to the local wildlife as some of the other creatures on this list that have cropped up in Florida, Floridians are mixed on them, with some hating them for their noise, droppings, and property damage (especially to patio screens and AC units) and others loving them for their beauty and embracing them as a natural tourist attraction.
</li></ul></li><li> The story of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore">Singapore</a> got its name — once upon a time, there was a fishing village called Temasek. Then a prince called Sang Nila Utama arrived, and upon reaching the shores of the island saw <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_tiger">a creature that looked like a giant cat, with a red body, a black head and a white chest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He asked his assistant what the animal was and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">was told it was a lion</a>. Hence the place was called the "Lion City" (i.e. <em>Singapura</em>) from that point on.
</li><li> Actual misplaced wildlife: there is a herd of South American <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(bird)">Rheas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> living in northeastern Germany, of all places. Apparently, winters here aren't that much worse than in Argentina.
<ul><li> There are also a few colonies of escaped wallabies living wild in the UK and in France.
</li><li> The grey squirrel is native to North America but now so common in the UK that most people never see the native red ones, to the point that there is currently a campaign to introduce squirrel-hunting—and squirrel-eating—to the UK, specifically targeting the Greys, so that the Reds have a chance to thrive again. There are also efforts going on to help the native Pine Marten recover by using it as a natural population controller against the Greys - Pine Martens and Red Squirrels developed as species at around the same time as each other, with Red Squirrels preferring to live in the trees to avoid their natural predator, the Pine Marten, who mostly lives on the ground. Grey Squirrels prefer to live on the ground as well, meaning that they'd be ample prey for the Marten.
</li></ul></li><li> Monkeys were released/escaped into the Everglades after the filming of the <em>Tarzan</em> movies there. While the movies were set in Africa, not Florida, they now depict accurately the fauna of the Everglades. When they were being filmed, they didn't...
<ul><li> Certain species of large constrictors often kept as pets have escaped or been illegally released when they got too big in such numbers that their populations in Florida may now be self-sustaining. So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">now we do have potentially man-eating snakes</a>.
</li><li> The same is true for several species of parrots/parakeets in various areas.
</li></ul></li><li> The rise of various "Beast of X" sightings and rumours circulating in rural northern England roughly coincides with a tightening of regulations on keeping large predators as pets. This is probably not a coincidence.
</li><li> There are many sightings of "black panthers" and maned lions in North America and Australia. Some fall under <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_cat">"Phantom cats"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a cryptozoological phenomenon revolving around large wild cats being sighted outside their indigenous environments.

Since lions and other large carnivores can be legally kept as pets in many US states, at least some reported sightings in the US are also genuine.
</li><li> It is widely believed that the countryside surrounding Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire supports a thriving wallaby population.
<ul><li> And aside of the wallabies there are Japanese sika deer all over the place, American gray squirrels driving native red squirrels into extinction and more Père David's deer, Chinese water deer and Reeves's muntjacs there than in their native China. British mammal fauna is completely FUBAR. Even <em>rabbits</em> weren't native to Britain until the Normans introduced them as game animals. Native British hares have mostly been displaced into isolated mountains and marshes by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">fast-breeding</a> continental coneys.
</li></ul></li><li> Some introduced species have become so widespread, their presence can be felt <em>all over the world</em>. One of the most ubiquitous, the rat, has spread so relentlessly that biologists haven't got a clue what sort of habitat their wild ancestors originally came from.
<ul><li> The most widespread and familiar rat is the Norway rat (also called the brown rat). While, like any inhabitable place, there are rats in Norway today, it's definitely <em>not</em> their original, indigenous location. They were called Norway rats by an English biologist in the 18th century, when the brown rat didn't even exist in Norway.

</li><li> Dromedary camels are native to the North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where they are now completely domesticated; it's generally accepted that they've been extinct in the wild for at least 2000 years. The only feral population is in Australia, where they were introduced in the mid-1800s as pack animals.
<ul><li> For a time, there was a small population of feral camels in the western United States, thanks to the short-lived efforts of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Camel_Corps">United States Camel Corps,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which used camels to help survey the uncharted (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirstyDesert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirstyDesert">and very arid</a>) American Southwest in the 1850s. The last reported sighting of a wild camel in the US was in Texas in 1941.
</li></ul></li><li> Many domestic species are like this: wild (actually feral) horses in the United States are descendants of animals brought over from Europe by Spanish explorers or that escaped from captivity. Likewise, feral populations of cats, dogs, goats, sheep, pigs, and pigeons are now common in many places that they're not native to. Pigs in particular have proved so able to colonize new territory that they've become a serious ecological problem in places like California, Hawaii, Florida, Texas, and Australia. However, horses evolved in North America, and only got to Eurasia relatively recently. They died out in North America about 10,000 years ago, before being reintroduced. Mustang defenders have argued that wild horses should be allowed in National Parks in the American Southwest because the archeological record shows they lived there before humans did.
</li><li> Non-native dolphins, sharks and seals sometimes turn up off the Atlantic coast of Britain.
</li><li> Pigs are native to Europe and Asia. Polynesians introduced them across the South Pacific. Spanish explorers introduced them to North America, South America, and everywhere else they went. Today, feral pigs are found from the US to Argentina, in Australia, and in a whole slew of other places they're not supposed to be. Unfortunately, due to their fast growth rate, high reproductive rate, ability to eat almost anything, and the general lack of predators capable of dealing with them, they've become a huge problem in most of the places they've been introduced to. On top of that, some historians believe that pigs that escaped from the Spaniards spread many of the diseases that devastated indigenous populations throughout the Americas.
</li><li> On June 2011, a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/8589213/Emperor-penguin-washes-up-on-beach-far-from-home-in-New-Zealand.html">young emperor penguin ended up on the coast of New Zealand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (where there are penguins, just different species).
</li><li> Every now and again, a walrus will be seen in or around Northern Scotland, even though that's still quite a ways away from the walrus's natural habitat, the Arctic Circle.
</li><li> Beluga Whales rarely visit the Thames Estuary in England; one affectionately named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_the_Beluga_Whale">Benny<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed up on his own in 2018, and appears to have made the Estuary his home.
</li><li> The South American coypu, also known as nutria (looks like a cross between a rat and a beaver), has invaded many parts of the USA and Europe after being introduced there by fur ranchers.
</li><li> The common starling was not native to North America until 1890, when Eugene Schieffelin and the American Acclimatization Society released 60-100 in Central Park as part of a plan to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare to America. They are now over 200 million strong and a major pest.
</li><li> Fish also get misplacedsometimes intentionally and sometimes notin various rivers and streams around the world. In North America, numerous species of Asian carp have infested lakes and rivers across the United States, and on occasion so have northern snakeheads. Alligator gar, native to the Southeast United States, have been found in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkmenistan and Singapore. The South American arapaima has been introduced to lakes and rivers in Thailand and Malaysia. There are varying reasons for this, from fish owned by private collectors escaping or being released into the wild, introduced to remove pest species or as part of conservation efforts.
<ul><li> Still other species have sneaked into rivers because their eggs or hatchlings got mixed in with the rocks and mud used as ballast in some types of boat. This is why lampreys are now a serious pest in many major U.S. rivers and parts of the Great Lakes.
</li></ul></li><li> The cane toad, native to South and Central America, was released into numerous islands in Oceania, the Caribbean, Hawaii and Australia where they were intended to reduce or eliminate cane beetles that were eating cane sugar, a valuable crop. The toads succeeded in their mission in most places (though <em>not</em> in Australia), but rather than stop at the beetles, they went on to eat anything else they could fit in their mouths. In addition to that, they have a deadly venom that frequently kills predator species. The lack of predators and an abundance of food sources have caused cane toad populations to explode and become a serious pest species that have destabilized every ecosystem they were introduced to.
</li><li> And just sometimes this works out all right. The fallow deer used to live in most of Europe until an ice age drove it all the way back to Turkey and beyond. Then the Romans came along and they apparently liked the deer so much they introduced the animals in, well, most of Europe.
</li><li> The old "Parisian Sewer Rat" carnival sideshow gig. If it's not a silly-looking rubber/plastic monster rat, it's typically a capybara, which are native to marshlands in South America.
</li><li> Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California, has played host to a herd of bison for nearly a century. The bison were initially introduced to the island by a film crew in the 1920s and were simply left behind when filming wrapped up. Thanks to a lack of major predators the herd ballooned to a population of nearly 600 at its highest. Current numbers sit at around 150-200 while any excess bison are used to help repopulate the Great Plains in the American Midwest.
</li><li> The famous problem of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia">rabbits in Australia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; they were initially brought over by colonists for food and hunting, and became so pervasive they damn near destroyed the Australian ecosystem.
<ul><li> Rabbits were also originally introduced to Great Britain, probably by the Normans who considered such "coneys" tasty. They weren't nearly as destructive in this case, as the British Isles already had their own native hare and rabbit species as well as predators that fed on them; native species of lagomorph did, however, suffer a great loss of home range to the imported newcomers, such that several are now confined to shrunken niches of swampland or mountain terrain.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of non-native game animals were introduced in various places of the USSR to diversify the hunting (or for other purposes), with varying degrees of success.
<ul><li> "Raccoon dog" or tanuki west of Urals. Success, since they did live there and went extinct only several thousand years ago.
</li><li> Nutria or coypu or "South American swamp beaver". They thrive on farms, but don't store food and can't survive long winters in the wild. By now they live only in Azerbaijan.
</li><li> Ostriches on the Black Sea coast. Partial success by 1941, but the project was abandoned because of the war and never revisited.
</li><li> Skunks. Failure.
</li><li> Common North American raccoon. Success in Belarus, Azerbaijan and a small area in southern Russia.
</li><li> For the same reason  to diversify huntable game  raccoons were introduced in Germany in 1930s. Later several dozen escaped from a fur farm. Today they thrive all over Germany.
</li></ul></li><li> 16th century chronicles from Novgorod, Russia, state that in 1581 "...ferocious beasts crocodiles came out of the river and blocked the road, bit many people, people were terrified and prayed to God all over the land..." Some historians write it off as an allegoric description of the grave events at the czar's court. Others believe the crocodiles were being delivered from Egypt via Syria for somebody's private zoo or zoos and escaped. Of course, they didn't survive the winter.
</li><li> A crocodile, nicknamed "Sifis" by the locals, lived in Crete, Greece from summer 2014 until spring 2015 (he died after a particularly long winter).
</li><li> The common pheasant, originally native to southwestern Asia, began being introduced to other parts of the Northern Hemisphere in Roman times. Less destructive than many of the above examples, it's blended into ecosystems of Europe and North America so seamlessly that it's now the state bird of South Dakota, despite being unheard of on the continent before 1881. Ironically, captive-bred lines of pheasants released for hunting have mostly replaced wild pheasants in their native country of Georgia, making this a case of an introduced species supplanting <em>itself</em>.
</li><li> There's now a concentrated effort to <a class="urllink" href="http://theaustralianrhinoproject.org/">introduce rhinoceros to Australia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in an attempt to save them from rampant poaching.
</li><li> In 1810 in Cumberland, England, there was a mysterious beast described as a large sandy brown striped animal, resembling both a dog and a cat, slaughtering sheep and drinking their blood, leading to it being dubbed the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girt_dog_of_Ennerdale">Vampire Dog of Ennerdale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's now believed it was a thylacine, escaped from one of the many unlicensed travelling menageries of the time.
</li><li> The exact origins of the domestic chicken aren't entirely clear, but it's likely they're all descended from the red junglefowl, probably hybrid with the grey junglefowl, native to India and south-east Asia. Despite being technically misplaced almost everywhere, they have become the most numerous bird in the world.
</li><li> Tanaxpillo, usually known as "La isla de los monos" ("the island of monkeys" in Spanish) on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Catemaco">Lake Catemaco<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Mexico, is home to a colony of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump-tailed_macaque">stump-tailed macaques<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from South Asia which were introduced on the place as part of a study regarding the species and its habitat.
</li><li> In Brazil, an activist painted her body in protest to Amazon Rainforest fires, portraying the rainforest on fire along with its flora, but with a giraffe included for some reason. Naturally, it lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>.

K. Rowling</a> has admitted that she didn't realize snowy owls weren't native to Britain when she wrote the first book. This is reflected in later books by Hedwig being the only snowy owl in the series and it's an occasional plot point that she's too distinctive to send secret messages. There's still the problem that only <em>male</em> snowy owls are pure white. Justified in that Hedwig was bought from a magical pet shop, which can presumably import or cosmetically-modify its animals.

<ul><li> Although mocked in the page quote, most tabletop games attempt to avert this. Not only are random encounter tables often tailored to different environments (you'll use a different table in a jungle than you would at sea), but the whole point of having a GM is to manage and/or justify such things. It's a poor GM who would just blindly throw 1d3 camels at a party in a swamp just because a table told them to - it's the GM's job to frame things in such a way that the encounter makes sense. Unfortunately this can be one of the harder aspects of being a GM, and it's common for inexperienced players to rely too much on the mechanical systems which tends to result in this trope.

<ul><li> Time to spoil the ending of every single "brain teaser" set in Australia, ever. There are no bears or wolves or whatever other misplaced animal the story featured heavily in Australia (well, there are dingoes...). The guy telling the story is a blowhard.
</li><li> Thanks to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, word got out that oil companies (not just BP) drilling in the Gulf of Mexico merely duplicated their recovery plans for spillages occurring in Alaska. This includes guidelines about how to assist walruses and polar bears endangered by a spill.
</li><li> Scott of the Antarctic took guns and ammunition to fight off polar bears. They observed that some penguins were covered in scars and deduced the existence of predators. Luckily for the explorers, the predators in question are killer whales and leopard seals; given that leopard seals are man-eaters, cunning hunters, and <em>bloody swift</em>, the armaments were a good idea anyway.
</li><li> Beavers, long extinct in the British Isles, have recently been reintroduced into Scotland using stock imported from North America. Some people are getting excited by the idea of re-introducing wolves and bears: the last native British wolf was killed by hunters in Suffolk in the 1500's.
<ul><li> This inspired the placename <em>Woolpit</em> celebrating where the last wolf was killed. Congleton in Cheshire is also known as <em>Beartown</em> for similar reasons.
</li><li> A bird species, the Great Bustard, is the subject of current attempts to re-establish a thriving population in the UK. The reason for their local extinction, however, is that they tasted great...
</li><li> There are said to be populations of wild boar, another formerly native species, in the New Forest of Hampshire. These are descendants of escapees from farms rearing them as a luxury meat, from examples imported from France. Hunted to extinction for sport and food, it is thought that poachers are active in depleting the new population...
</li></ul></li><li> While a common example of this trope (as shown in the page image) is of penguins far from the South Pole, there are, in fact, species of penguin that live in warmer climates in the Southern Hemisphere, such as the little blue penguin of Australia and the aptly-named African penguin.
