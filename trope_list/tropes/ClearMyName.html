The only person who fits that description that we've met so far is Kenshiro, but we know for a fact he didn't do it. His sister is eventually found and cured of her blindness by Ken, but when Rei finds out about Ken's seven scars, he laughs it off, saying that he knows Ken is too nice a guy to ever do something like that. Turns out the real culprit is Jagi, who has been trying to frame Ken the whole time.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Batfamily members</a> were the ones doing the clearing up, while Batman considered that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Bruce Wayne</a>" had just become a burden to be abandoned, even saying that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentityIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentityIdentity">Bruce Wayne doesn't exist</a>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> was once accused of murder and had to fight to prove he was innocent.

</li><li> In a bizarre reversal, Batman races against time to clear <em>the Joker's</em> name in <em>The Joker: Devil's Advocate</em>, as his insanity defense finally fails and he's sentenced to death, but for a murder he didn't actually commit.
</li></ul></li><li> For decades, this is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> stayed a regular guy without a support network, all thanks to J. Jonah Jameson.
<ul><li> And then Jameson became the mayor of New York, running the office just like he does the Bugle (what with the spider-slander, and sending Spider-slayers after Spidey).
</li><li> If you didn't figure out that he was never going to ease up on Spidey after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> basically told him "look dumbass, this man is out there every day helping people no matter how much shit you dump on him, ease off already and we'll give you an exclusivity deal with the New Avengers", and this didn't help... no-one here can help you.
</li><li> Jameson just makes sure everyone knows about it when there's the slightest possibility that Spidey may have committed a crime. Other cast members are the ones doing the framing, which they do with disturbing regularity. In the newspaper comics, Spider-man has averaged one frame job a year for <em>decades</em>. You'd think that by now the NYPD would get smart about the whole thing and just ignore the reports of him allegedly committing <em>another</em> burglary.

<ul><li> The first incident was the "Mecha Madness" epilogue: Sonic's arrested for becoming Mecha Sonic, disobeying a royal order from Sally. After outwitting an overzealous Antoine into realizing that the one who got him that way, Nack the Weasel, was missing and evidence was pointing towards him, Sally ordered Sonic to bring Nack back by sunrise or be exiled. Needless to say, Sonic did it.
</li><li> The big one, however, was "EndGame". Sonic's framed from the supposed death of Princess Sally, in a manner befitting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em>, Sonic breaks free and is able to prove his innocence through Dulcy the Dragon. In short order, the true suspect is captured, Robotnik is utterly defeated and Sonic's reunited happily with Sally.
</li></ul></li><li> Recently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009">Batgirl</a> (Stephanie Brown) was framed for murdering a fellow collegiate she'd actually tried to help before his death.

It's never established one way or the other in the story if he's telling the truth, since he simultaneously starts a career as a supervillain with unrelated crimes.

For the large part of the game, the party must use the sewer entrance to enter the capital city.
<ul><li> Justified, as one of your team members <em>is</em> an ex-con having been in prison for murder.
</li><li> There are also a few places in Sylvarant where the party is accused of impersonating themselves because the people impersonating them got there first. In two places, this gets cleared up relatively quickly, but one guy never believes they are who they really are.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, Rita Mordio is accused by Yuri Lowell (the game's protagonist) of being a blastia thief. She takes them to Shaikos Ruins stating that she'd "clear her name" — and use the the rest of the party for help in completing her formula, naturally, though this isn't stated (by Karol!) until after the battle with Goliath.
</li><li> In the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em>, this happens to GDI because of Nod's forged video footage about a village being burned to the ground.
<ul><li> Another case in a more recent game is in <em>Red Alert 3</em>, where Soviet General Krukov is branded a traitor by Premier Cherdenko. Krukov then believes the commander (the player) is a traitor instead. Neither of them expects that Cherdenko <strong>himself</strong> is the traitor. The result is the death of both Cherdenko and Krukov with the commander going on to destroy New York.

While the Grey Wardens are wanted for betraying King Cailan at Ostagar, you have more important things to do than clear your name, such as gathering the army you need to fight the Darkspawn horde. It also helps that, thanks to the near mythic reputation of the Grey Wardens and the unpopularity of the current regent, almost nobody believes the accusation anyway. When people do try to bring you in it's not out of a genuine belief in your guilt but rather a desire for the bounty on your head.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, if a Human Noble, Arl Rendon Howe does everything possible to smear the Warden and his/her family's name after having entire said family slaughtered. As with the above, the Warden's father was one of the most beloved men in the nation, whereas Howe is despised by almost every nobleman in the nation. Almost every nobleman the Warden meets passes their condolences and assures him/her that they don't believe a word Howe says (though they basically do nothing to help you otherwise).
</li><li> The Dwarven Noble Warden is either framed during their origin story for the murder of their elder brother Trian, or forced to kill him in self-defence, as they were both manipulated by their younger brother Bhelen to believe the other was plotting to kill them. Despite returning to Orzammar later in the game, the Dwarf Noble never actually clears their name.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em>, Ryu is quickly implicated in a plot to kidnap Wyndian Princess Nina due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Of course, once he rescues Nina from the actual kidnappers (which admittedly takes a while), she declines to go back home and continues to travel with Ryu, essentially making him guilty of <em>actually</em> kidnapping her. This doesn't get cleared up until years later in game, and by "cleared up", we mean that Ryu is 100% not welcome in Wyndia Castle anymore.
</li><li> Roughly the first half of Act II in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> is spent in an effort to prove the PC innocent of slaughtering an entire Luskan village.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a></em> is an interesting case. While Lucas, the main character actually killed the man at the beginning of the game, he was possessed while doing so and had no control over his actions.

However, after Vatra Games reevaluated what Silent Hill was, they decided that the location of Silent Hill was alive and that it could make your fears and sins manifest. Therefore, Murphy needed to be a little less innocent and was changed to a flawed but sympathetic protagonist. He's now a man on the run from his captors, his past, and himself — and that path has led him to Silent Hill.

With nobody else left to retake the title of gamemaster, Sir Divish decides to appoint Henry - not realizing he is likely an unrepentant mass-poacher / kidnapper.
