</p><p>Sometimes caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">unrealistic expectations</a>. People who think all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tales</a> are intended for children (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">they weren't always</a>) and therefore free from violence (which they weren't, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">even when intended for children</a>) are often shocked by the degree of violence when they read an un<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> version.

It's not uncommon for battles to turn into a mess of dogs (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">bears</a> towards the end) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">High-Pressure Blood</a>. This series (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">admittedly rather poorly cut</a>) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">extremely popular among Nordic children in the early '90s</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">shounen</a> series (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> - see below) contain scenes of surprisingly bloody violence considering that most are aimed primarily at kids/early teens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sasuke pulling Zaku's arms until they <em>dislocate</em>. There wasn't any blood but the poor guy was screeching like there's no tomorrow. You can understand why this scares the crap out of Sakura, even though that's the guy who just stomped her into the ground a minute ago.
</li><li> The climax of the Land of Waves arc, particularly Zabuza's final clash with Kakashi.
</li><li> In the manga when the same Zaku had one of his arms blown <em>off</em> at the forearm because of Shino's bugs (in the anime both arms are just injured).
</li><li> Naruto stabbing himself with a kunai to make a promise and remove some poison. The wound healed itself (unbeknownst to Naruto) and the actual scene of him doing it was cut in the broadcast version in the U.S (though Kakashi's line makes it fairly obvious). Oddly enough, later episodes are even more lenient when it comes to censorship.
</li><li> When fighting Killer Bee, Sasuke on separate occasion is impaled with multiple swords like a pin-cushion and has so much of the flesh on his chest blow off to the point that you can see his ribs sticking out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">He's lucky his friends can heal him</a>.
</li><li> In the fight in the manga between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto and Pain</span> the latter pins down the former by <em>sticking a spike through both of his hands and into the ground</em>. This is eventually followed by <em>six more spikes</em>; one in each of his arms, hips, and legs.
</li><li> Later, from the same arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto's eight-tailed form is essentially a fox without any skin, and the nine-tails tries to get Naruto to open the seal by making the seal on his chest into a massive bloody hole</span>.
</li><li> There's also when Gaara crushes some people to death with sand, causing a huge rain-shower of blood to fall. The anime had to make the blood black instead of red, or even Japanese censors probably would have vetoed it. In <em>Shippuuden</em>, a giant chameleon summon is sliced in half with predictably horrible results, but here the blood was red though it vanished along with the chameleon.
</li><li> Sasuke fighting Naruto and delivering a head-first piledriver to him on solid rock from over several hundred feet in the air, clearly smashing his head into a bloody impact, his lifeless body dropping limply in the water. The Nine Tails makes him all better, but the visual of it is still nightmarish.
</li><li> In the final battle between Naruto and Sasuke near the end of the they both end up severely bruised. They also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blow one of each other's hand off and nearly bleed out, with only Sakura's arrival saving them</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The manga had the Shadow Game between Marik and Mai. Remember how in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">the anime</a>, the duelists would lose memories every time they lost a monster or life points? Well, in the manga, the duelists take whatever damage is done to their monsters (it's worse when you realize that in the manga, the monsters don't disintegrate or explode when they die, like in the anime). When Mai's monster attacks Marik's, it chops its head off. So MARIK'S HEAD FALLS OFF, AND HE PICKS IT UP - STILL TALKING. It gets worse. Later Marik summons a horrific electric torture device that looks like something out of the <em>Saw</em> movies and uses it to electrocute Mai.
</li><li> Oh, and remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">*Cough* "Dark Energy Disks"</a> in the Yugi/Arkana duel? Well not only are they back to the original saw blades, one SLICES INTO ARKANA'S LEG AS YUGI FREES HIM AND HE SCREAMS IN PAIN. Yikes.
</li><li> Happened quite a bit in the manga back when it was in its early days and the focus wasn't so much on card games, but more on Yami dealing out 'justice'. Almost all of what Yami did was Family Unfriendly Violence, but it wasn't just the bad guys that suffered, oh no. A couple of example of FUV towards the main characters includes Yugi getting <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.onemanga.com/Yu-Gi-Oh/48/16/">hung from a chain by the Millennium Puzzle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, and Joey/Jonouchi being tortured <em>with tazers</em>. Hoo boy.
</li><li> In fact, the very first "game" played in Yu-Gi-Oh involves knives...
</li></ul></li><li> The entire concept of the Shadow Games was created in the dub to avoid the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">actually saying the characters were dead...</a> by instead saying that losing the Duel sent them to a hellish dimension that either swallowed you whole or destroyed you a piece at a time because that is somehow considered better than just straight up death...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Usually avoided but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sailor Venus'</span> death comes to mind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>She gets impaled through the stomach by large stalagmites</em> and then burns to death. But don't worry, she gets better.</span>
</li><li> The manga has quite a few fight scenes that involve the villain brutally kicking the senshi or physically hitting them with weapons like a staff. Arguably the worst is in the last volume, when Sailor Moon undergoes an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> senshi, who take advantage of the fact that she can't bring herself to harm them back</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Battling in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> is usually clean and shown to do little damage. Sometimes the violence is upped though. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins">Pokémon Origins</a></em> has the infamous scene where Blue's Squirtle uses Bite on Red's Charmander. It's not bloody however it is horrifyingly painful <em>sounding</em>. Charmander screeches in pain until Red is forced to put it back in its Pokeball.
</li><li> Early chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> are rather gory, such as when Giovanni freezes a Pokemon before splitting it into pieces. Trainers were frequently bruised up in battles as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> More than one episode has a battle where a Pokémon is seriously injured or is the victim of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a>. Probably the earliest in the series might have been Ash's Vermilion City Gym battle, where on his first try Pikachu got the ever-living snot beaten out of it by Surge's Raichu.
</li><li> One episode has Cynthia ordering her Garchomp to put her claws to a Galactic members throat, making it very clear that Cynthia will invoke mortal damage if needed. This is a rare case of non-comedic violence against humans and is more aggressive than the anime usually goes for.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure">Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl Adventure!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hareta versus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mitsumi</span> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> where both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">he</a> and his Pokemon get beat up.
</li><li> Koya's Growlithe gets into a terribly one-sided battle against a Gyarados that was so brutal it ended up mentally scarred. It wouldn't even let its trainer touch it afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> Ash's (ill-trained and disobedient) Charizard versus Richie's Charizard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu">The Electric Tale of Pikachu</a></em> has Ash's Charizard attempting to <em>kill</em> Richie's. He <em>bloodily</em> bites into his neck.
</li><li> The violence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> can get downright gruesome at times, as characters are beheaded, their limbs are amputated, they are impaled, crushed under heavy debris, and in one example from <em>Steel Ball Run</em>, completely obliterated into tiny cube-shaped pieces. Someone at Shueisha (or Araki himself) seems to have caught on to this, as from <em>Steel Ball Run</em> on, the series was published in a magazine targeted at adults.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series contains frequent instances of characters being shot, stabbed, slashed, savagely beaten, what have you. This is particularly jarring given the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">cartoony look</a> and the story's (supposedly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">heavily idealistic perspective</a>.
</li><li> One such example is when Luffy is captured by the Bluejam pirates during a flashback. One member decides to interrogate him by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> beating the everloving crap out of him with spiked gloves, until he is barely conscious. Luffy was SEVEN YEARS OLD at this point</span>.
</li><li> What Robin does to Spandam (particularly how it's shown in the anime), and what Luffy does to Oars. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Both villains get attacked so savagely <em>their spinal columns collapse into pieces</em></span>. As a slight justification with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oars</span>, it was the only way to defeat him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As a zombie, he didn't feel pain, so the only way to destroy him was essentially ripping his body apart in some way. And as stated before, he didn't feel pain from his spine breaking - he simply fell to the ground and commented that he wondered why he couldn't move anymore.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>:
<ul><li> The manga has Manta being FORCIBLY DISSECTED ALIVE, WITHOUT ANESTHETIC.
</li><li> The 4kids English dub somehow got away with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hao beating Yoh to a pulp and then <em>ripping his soul out and eating it</em></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Allegedly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> received complaints about this from parents during its initial airing due to being broadcast in a time slot usually reserved for family-friendly programming. The fact that GAINAX allegedly had spent so much money on court costs dealing with the complaints resulted in the director and the production team having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">redo their</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">intended ending</a> due to the unforeseen "budget constraints."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> For a few examples, we've got dismemberment (Frieza tearing Nail's arm <em>singlehandedly</em>) and impalement (Dodoria once impales a Namekian warrior with his <em>fist</em>, as does Gohan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">SSJ2</a> to Bojack.) And those are just a few examples. DBZ is <em>brutal</em>!
</li><li> The manga contains quite a few instances of surprising violence that are toned down in the anime.
<ul><li> Vegeta <em><a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/e/e5/VegetakillsGuldo_Manga.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120517180352">punches off Guldo's head<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> in the manga in a rather explicit, sloppy, and bloody decapitation, complete with Guldo's visible disconnected spinal column. He still decapitates him in the anime, but it's with a clean, sharp ki blast that's nowhere near as graphic.
</li><li> Dr. Gero <a class="urllink" href="https://theultradork.tumblr.com/post/104984535833/friendly-reminder-that-in-the-manga-gero-crushed">crushes a man's throat and pops his head off like a Pez dispenser<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Absent in the anime.
</li><li> When Gohan rips apart the Cell Juniors, you can see their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">brains splattering around</a></em>. In the anime they just explode into puffs of smoke.
</li><li> When Vegeta kills Pui Pui, you can see his bloody remains in the blast while he's dying. In the anime he's just instantly vaporized, leaving nothing.
</li><li> When Gohan, Goku, and Vegeta first come upon Babidi's ship, there are corpses strewn about the area, including dead children and <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/yJNeyd5.jpg">a woman who was ripped in half at the waist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, with her intestines spilling out. This isn't seen in the anime.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> manga, when Lucy is captured by Gajeel. The manga has him just chucking knives at her like a dartboard. They never showed a knife in the anime version; instead, he brutally attacks her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RayearthOVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RayearthOVA">Rayearth OVA</a></em> has several grim moments, notably the girls bleeding as the rune gods they pilot are hurt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is a battle manga with lots of completely normal shounen violence. That is, until As Nodt drops an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> on Byakuya Kuchiki in the goriest, most brutal defeat of the entire story. Byakuya is splattered into a wall, limbs ripped from his body and his entire torso shredded right open to the bone. Literally. His entire ribcage and spine is completely visible. The volume publication deliberately blurs the image compared to the original chapter publication to disguise the torso injury slightly. Apparently even the manga publisher felt that scene was a bit too gory .
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaikyouryuNoJidai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaikyouryuNoJidai">Daikyouryu no Jidai</a></em> isn't shy about showing how brutal life in prehistoric times could be, with the Tyrannosaurus getting impaled on several other dinosaurs' spikes, and eating several more, including hatchlings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MotherKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MotherKeeper">Mother Keeper</a></em> has quite a bit of this. In chapter 2, there's a rather gruesome picture of the inside of a guy's chest. Later it moves on to slicing kids' heads off, blowing a guy's head off and slicing a guy's torso in half and showing you the inside. During <em>Hunter</em> part 2, a character suffers second degree chemical burns and has his arm sliced off. The series may be a little tamer than some, but a lot of work is put into the gore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SatouKashiNoDanganWaUchinukenai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SatouKashiNoDanganWaUchinukenai">Satou Kashi no Dangan wa Uchinukenai</a></em> is a shounen manga that at first glance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForLittleGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForLittleGirls">looks like it could be shoujo</a>. It's a mostly melancholy story about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> but it does contain two horrifying, though not too gory, cases of violence. The first one has Nagisa and Mokuzu coming across <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mokuzu's deceased dog cut up and dumped in the mountains by Mokuzu's father</span>. The second is even worse but is covered up by a bush, not that it leaves much to the imagination. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagisa and her older brother go into the mountains to see if Mokuzu's father really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">kill her</a>. He did, and left her dismembered body in the forest.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">notoriously violent</a> to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> used it to show off how its revived block wasn't kid friendly anymore. Despite this, it was run in a magazine geared at middle and high schoolers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> looks family-friendly at first, thanks to its vibrant character designs and the general ages of the main cast. Then people start getting picked off, and <em>messily</em>, in the Hunter Exams, and one of the protagonists <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> rips a serial killer's heart out of their chest</span>.

At that point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> is in full effect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> used by the Italian government. Obviously it doesn't shy from showing characters get shot and beat up, though it isn't normally <em>too</em> bloody.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus">Venus Versus Virus</a></em> is usually rather tame however in order to go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Berserker mode</a> she must shoot herself with a special bullet. It's not bloody, though, and it doesn't appear to hurt. One instance has obvious suicide allusions as she puts a gun to her head and shoots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> has many, <em>many</em> scenes of people being gorily killed on-page. Even without involving the protagonist Kenshiro and his brothers, capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">making heads explode</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom">a simple poke</a>, the Nanto practitioners who can cut anything with their hands, and the other practitioners of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts">Supernatural Martial Arts</a>.

Notably it actually seems to have been bad enough to cause permanent damage as eye seems to be partially forced shut the rest of the comic even into her old age in the present day. It also appears to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBlood">Black Blood</a>.
</li><li> This was one of Bendis and Oeming's goals with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em>, as they explicitly declared in the afterword to one of the collected volumes. They wanted the violence - especially between anyone other than two supers - to be ugly and painful instead of flashy and stylized. One of the worst moments comes with an arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggle</a> antagonist was caught by the cops after one of her bombs had killed an officer. The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">interrogation</a>" was extremely dark and unpleasant, even for a character you had been set up to hate up to this point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Violine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Violine">Violine</a></em>, Violine gets injured at times, either by crashes or villains, and is shown bleeding, often from the head. She also bleeds from her legs in one nightmare. Other characters get bloody injuries as well, and some are eaten by crocodiles offscreen. There are also a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">taps on the head</a> which show blood, sometimes even implied to be deadly.
</li><li> A rather infamous issue of the British G1 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> comics has the backstory of the Twinkle-Eyed ponies. Applejack stumbled upon them living underground, enslaved by an evil wizard into digging for gems. The ponies had gone blind due to a lack of light. Applejack saves them when she accidentally pushes the wizard to his death. The blind ponies put gems in their eyesockets to act as eyes from then on.

It does contain some relatively gory scenes though, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aftermath of Pizzazz's car crash</span>.
</li><li> Quite common in Italian comics. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TexWiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TexWiller">Tex Willer</a></em> has multiple cases of people being shot and knifed on-page, culminating with Mefisto being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">eaten alive by rats</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a> is known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">The Murderer With a Thousand Faces</a>" for a reason (but he wasn't responsible for the one guy eaten alive by rats), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rat-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rat-Man">Rat-Man</a></em> had, among the other examples, the protagonist enter gladiatorial games where he suffered such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> at the hands of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Kenshiro</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> that the paying public told him to stop it...

Severed limbs, getting your guts ripped out, snapped spines, blood gushing, laser burns, and getting bitten in half are just a few of the ways characters get horribly mutilated or, (increasingly severely) mutilate or kill others. In one book, one of the team quits because she can't stand all the violence. What pushed her to this end? She <em>ripped the throat out of an alien while in wolf morph</em> and when she changed back and went home, her father mentioned that she had something between her teeth.

</li><li> The Telos Novellas, which were aimed exclusively at adult fans, are even used as an example of this on the TARDIS Wiki where it points out that 'family franchise' means 'the whole family can find something to enjoy in the fictional world' and <em>not</em> that 'everything in the franchise is suitable for children'. The Wiki specifically highlights a scene in <em>Wonderland</em> where Ben and Polly have to make a room of acid-addled hippies vomit by sticking their hands down their throats, in case any of them have taken the evil LSD that drives the plot, and follows it up with a suggestion that parents read the book first before allowing their children to read it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, which in the UK is considered and treated as a children's show (unlike other parts of the world that air it) has been a regular target of criticism over its violence and scariness ever since it first hit the airwaves in 1963. It was a particular favorite target of infamous 1970s TV watchdog Mary Whitehouse, who would regularly issue condemnation whenever anyone got killed or an otherwise PG-rated moment occurred.
<ul><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a> stuff could be especially grisly due to the more relaxed content guidelines of the time (it wasn't until the late 60s that clear standards for what was acceptable for broadcast began to be dictated by the BBC, and until then it was up to the judgement of the producers):
<ul><li> According to director Waris Hussein, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E1AnUnearthlyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E1AnUnearthlyChild">An Unearthly Child</a>" would have contained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a> of a caveman smashing someone's head open with a rock, with a stagehand poised with a hammer and a pumpkin just off screen, but producer Verity Lambert rushed in and ordered him to stop because it was supposed to be for children. The same story also included the Doctor having to be stopped by Ian from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">bashing someone's head in with a rock on the flimsiest of pretexts</a>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction">The Edge of Destruction</a>" has a still-alarming scene where Susan (driven temporarily mad thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a>) lunges at Ian with a pair of surgical scissors, then suddenly shreds her bed to pieces with them before collapsing onto it, crying and screaming. This led to the first of the many debates in the media over the years about whether the show was too violent.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E6TheAztecs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E6TheAztecs">The Aztecs</a>" contains a scene where Ian is trying to intimidate a bunch of Aztec warriors by taking them aside with a knife and saying in a very calm, terrifying and unflinching voice that he could stab them to death at any time, in any place, exactly when they least expect it. Ian is normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">makes dad jokes</a>, not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">Terror Hero</a>.

</li><li> Ian getting tortured in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E6TheCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E6TheCrusade">The Crusade</a>" by being smeared with honey and left in the desert for ants to chew slowly through his flesh, birds circling above waiting to start on his eyes. Complete with a gruesome description from the torturer that this was what would happen.

</li></ul></li><li> According to the director Morris Barry, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen">Tomb of the Cybermen</a>" (an unusually scary story even by later standards) got him into serious trouble with the BBC for the scene where Toberman kills a Cyberman. There is a special effects shot where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienBlood">awful thick white fluid</a> begins spewing out of its crushed lung unit while it spasms and groans itself to a painful death. Barry claimed the BBC told him it was too much but "children adored it".
</li><li> Much of the footage that survives of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episodes</a> is actually the violent bits - the Australian censor board removed them, archived the parts they had cut, and then threw away the actual story. Notable examples include Episode 1 of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E5TheUnderwaterMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E5TheUnderwaterMenace">The Underwater Menace</a>" (which preserves an extended sequence of Polly being forcibly anaesthetised in preparation for being turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">fish-person</a> while screaming and bellowing in protest) and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep">Fury From the Deep</a>" (which preserves the alarming sequence of possessed repairmen suddenly opening their mouths and eyes as wide as they can go and emitting toxic gas).
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear">The Web of Fear</a>" was, at the time of broadcast, considered so scary that before the first episode aired, the BBC broadcast a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings">Content Warning</a> speech delivered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">Patrick Troughton</a> in character, warning children that this was going to be an especially scary one and asking them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyParentSeriousChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyParentSeriousChild">hold their parents' hands if Mum and Dad get too scared</a>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E1SpearheadFromSpace">Spearhead From Space</a>" has a car accident when a man avoids running down an Auton and instead goes into a tree. We see a shattered windscreen covered in blood.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E1TerrorOfTheAutons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E1TerrorOfTheAutons">Terror of the Autons</a>" contains a sequence where Jo gets blasted in the face by a Nestene <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheKillerWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheKillerWhatever">plastic daffodil</a> that seals her mouth and nose under a few inches of plastic, instantly glued to her face. Her look of horror as the Doctor tries to pull it off, can't, and dashes away to get help is stomach-churning. The Doctor rescues her by spraying her with acetone. Considering the serial was inspired at least partially about warnings about plastic bags, this had elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a> about it.
</li><li> Barry Letts, when criticised for the violence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> era, said he had a policy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a> - "You never see the spear going in or blood coming out". The show did push this restriction to the limit, and by the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> era blood was a common sight.
</li><li> The Hinchcliffe years, nicknamed the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">Gothic Horror</a> period" (Tom Baker's Seasons 12-14) were notorious for this and attracted so much media criticism that Hinchcliffe lost his job and the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retooled</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> sci-fi comedy format.
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E1TerrorOfTheZygons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E1TerrorOfTheZygons">Terror of the Zygons</a>" has the shape-changing Zygon impersonating Harry attacking Sarah with a pitchfork and accidentally getting impaled by it. We don't see anything gruesome, but the way that the scene is shot approaches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> and is one of the most disturbing moments of the era.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E4TheAndroidInvasion">The Android Invasion</a>" has Sarah Jane's face falling off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">revealing a terrifying robot face</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">with protruding eyeballs</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes">Robert Holmes</a> famously received a letter about this from an eight-year-old complaining it was too scary (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticReading">Dramatic Reading</a> of which is included as a DVD special feature).
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius">The Brain of Morbius</a>" features some mildish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a>, someone getting shot in the stomach and lurching down a corridor oozing blood from his body and mouth as he goes, and some Sarah Jane-related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a> moments.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom">The Seeds of Doom</a>" involves the Doctor snapping a man's neck, threatening people with guns and making Molotov cocktails.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E3TheDeadlyAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E3TheDeadlyAssassin">The Deadly Assassin</a>" has a whole episode of the Doctor and the assassin chasing each other around a jungle, getting more and more beaten up as they go, with realistic physical effects. The Doctor getting shot, twice. The Doctor staggering around in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteShirtOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteShirtOfDeath">White Shirt of Death</a> covered in blood and filth with a broken leg and arm. The Doctor shooting a man with a toxic blowgun that causes his leg to blister up, forcing the victim to perform improvised surgery on it with a knife and needle. The notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> freeze-frame with the Doctor's head being held underwater, making it appear as if he'd drowned. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> had serious misgivings about the sequence, as he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">real-life phobia of being trapped underwater</a> and worried his performance was too genuine and disturbing for children as a result.
</li><li> An ad-lib by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> to avert what he saw as this in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E4TheFaceOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E4TheFaceOfEvil">The Face of Evil</a>" led to one of the Fourth Doctor's most memorable moments. The script called for him to take a man hostage, pull a knife on him, and threaten to slit his throat unless the aliens dropped their weapons. What he actually does in the show is take a man hostage, pull a <em>jelly baby</em> on him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceKilledAManWithANoodleImplement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceKilledAManWithANoodleImplement">threaten to kill him with it</a> unless the aliens dropped their weapons. In both versions, they are terrified and do as he says.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E3ImageOfTheFendahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E3ImageOfTheFendahl">Image of the Fendahl</a>" deserves a mention, since even though it was made at the time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> had managed to get the previous producer fired over violence and the executives were watching the show very closely to prevent anything even slightly scary being put in, the script concerns the Doctor fighting a manifestation of the death wish itself, with the characters inside the siege struggling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">despair and suicidal ideation</a> as a result of its effects, and the Doctor defeats it by blasting it in the face with a shotgun. There's a definite attempt to avoid showing the audience anything too grisly but it somehow makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">even worse</a>.
</li><li> The other era of the show that was particularly notorious for this was seasons 21-2, when script editor Eric Saward took a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> direction. Particularly controversial incidents included:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E3Frontios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E3Frontios">Frontios</a>": People are dragged screaming down into the ground, and we see a digging machine controlled by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU">severed head</a>. (The latter scene was actually toned down compared to the script, which had the entire machine made from dismembered human body parts.)

This is also notable for being one of the only times in the revival series that the Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">showed little to no remorse for the human victims.</a>
</li><li> The revival series, while a <em>lot</em> less violent due to changing societal standards, still managed to sneak some bizarrely gritty violence into "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar">A Good Man Goes to War</a>", which is about a woman being kidnapped and abused in a very sexualised way so that they can kidnap her baby (and with realistic psychological effects on her (for that episode, anyway) rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst">Angst?

<ul><li> In "Dad's Dungeon", where a fruit witch accidentally eats her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple">cursed apple</a> and consequently gets covered in vines, which rot off to reveal an apple that has entrapped her. Her two sisters then eat her and what's left behind is a <em>apple core covered in bones and blood.</em> Not apple juice that sorta looked like blood, <strong>actual blood</strong> (it was even visible on the red apple skin).
</li><li> Another of the worst examples is "No-One Can Hear You", first when the Stag deliberately breaks both of Finn's legs (particularly shocking since it comes out of nowhere and there's no scary build-up). Then at the end of the episode, when a cinder block gets dropped on the Stag's head you can see his skull get crushed and his neck break.

<ul><li> In "The Storm", we see how Zuko got his scar. Although we are treated to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a>, it's entirely obvious that Ozai <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">shot his son in the face with fire</a></em> (for speaking out of turn, no less), which would be rather...<em>disconcerting</em> to younger viewers.
</li><li> "The Boiling Rock" has a man tortured by being held upside down for a long time, which sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>, but is actually quite painful and is a real form of torture.

He pulls one out, and not only does he visibly bleed (a rarity for this show), but it is apparently so painful that he roars at the top of his lungs and doesn't bother trying to get rid of the rest. He remains that way for <em>days.</em>
</li><li> Bloodbending is first introduced in "The Puppetmaster". The victims always look in great pain and shock. Potentially, a Bloodbender could not only manipulate muscles, which is implied, but crush the victim's internal organs, stop the heart or, in a similar vein to extracting fluid from plants (killing the plant in the process).
</li><li> The show's premise itself ("the Last Airbender") is dependent on a genocide that took place in the story universe 100 years prior to the plot of the show. They might not be allowed to use the word itself, but however you look at it, the Fire Nation killing off every single one of the Air Nomads for being Air Nomads is genocide.
<ul><li> Aang crying over the skeleton of his dead mentor surrounded by the skeletons of dozens of his attackers is a pretty chilling scene, it has to be said.

<ul><li> The <em>Avatar</em> sequel series continues the tradition nicely, taking the already-disturbing concept of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bloodbending</span> and turning it into something utterly horrifying It's hard to believe they were even allowed to show <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aang</span> screaming in agony as his limbs were twisted the wrong way and his attacker attempted to kill him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">twisting his neck.</a> None of the other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bloodbending</span> scenes were quite that violent, but seeing teenaged <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Noatak</span> practically torturing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brother Tarrlok</span> with it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at his father's request</span> was just as disturbing.
</li><li> Amon's ability to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">remove people's bending</span> looks quite disturbing in practice. It's basically framed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution">Public Execution</a>, and his victims fall forward lifelessly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen">staring eyes</a> and gaping mouths after he does it.
</li><li> Pretty much every time Amon attacks a public place could be an example. His takeover of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Pro-bending Arena during the finals</span> is bad enough, but he still manages to outdo himself later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnapping the entire Republic City council besides Tenzin, gassing the police station, bombing the entire city from airships, and attacking Air Temple Island for the express purpose of capturing Tenzin and his children</span>.

</li><li> Just as a side note, it is more acceptable to show violence in the cartoon <em>The Legend of Korra</em> than other cartoons, as it's aimed more at teenagers than little children (much like Japanese anime often are), which is somewhat unusual for western cartoons (as western cartoons tend to be aimed at pre-teens and younger children). The only problem could be if for example a parent mistakes it for being a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">kids show</a>" and let their eight-year-old kid watch it.

They cut away from the Joker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">slapping Harley</a>, but they clearly show him <em>throw her out of a window</em> several stories to the ground. Harley survives, but we see her on top of rubble, blood coming out of her mouth (averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a> as well).
</li><li> Regarding the page quote, it's worth pointing out that victims who are gassed and given the Joker grin are not mentioned to be alive or seen again afterwards, making it very easy for the kids watching at home to infer that the gas is quite lethal.
</li></ul></li><li> Its distant sequel series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> is no stranger to violence and its movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></em>, is even worse. There are two different death scenes for different characters, one for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Joker</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bonk, the pale Jokerz</span>. The former is either shot in the chest with his own <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bang-flag</span> gun by his hostage or slips and falls, which entangles him in electrical wires over a pool of water and fries him alive. The latter is shot with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bang-flag</span> gun or sprayed with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joker Venom gas</span> as a warning to the rest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> had this in spades in 'The Ultimate Enemy.' We see some rampant destruction of buildings, but also the effects of the violence on the ghosts and many of the humans—many of them are crippled, or in the case of one human character, <em>losing an arm altogether.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vlad also states that in the future, human Danny ended up being killed by his ghost side.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> mostly averts this, having more of a slapstick type of violence that's over-the-top, yet somewhat tame. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show</a></em> reveals the kids' injuries from the Eds' latest scam: Jonny with a <em>bear trap on his head</em>, Nazz with almost all of her hair fallen off and wearing a magician's box, Kevin looking like he was <em>set on fire</em>, and a chunk of Rolf's torso and arm <em>bitten off</em>, as well as a <em>thin, long lump on his head</em></span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, that's nothing compared to the horrifying torture Eddy receives in the hands of his older brother, who <em>twists Eddy's leg</em> in a way that well past comical and a step higher to horror. The fact that Eddy begs in agony to stop just exacerbates the situation.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">surprising amount of this</a> considering that it's a Disney show. Some of the highlights are Dipper nearly getting his tongue cut off with lamb shears, a kid getting eaten alive on screen (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though he was fine by the end albeit "twaumatized" in his words</span>), and Dipper embedding an ax in a monster with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">gory discretion shot</a>. The show has also has shown blood on a few different occasions, such as taxidermy animals bleeding from their eyes and mouths as they chant demonically. One episode also shows a bunch of demons playing a game using a <em>dead body</em>, where, after spinning said body a la Spin the Bottle, the spinner eats whoever it lands on.
</li><li> Happened quite a few times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em> (what do you expect from a show where the Grim Reaper is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a>?). One of the most gruesome examples is when Billy is thrown off his bike and hits the ground face-first; his <em>entire face is shredded off</em>, revealing the muscles and arteries underneath. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">He's completely healed five seconds later, but still...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HermanAndKatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HermanAndKatnip">Herman and Katnip</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">clone</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, but with that series's violence and sadistic nature taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. It's to the point that these two were the true inspiration behind Itchy and Scratchy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
</li><li> The short-lived but popular Nicktoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> had a plethora of Nightmare Fuel, although asking the famously disturbing Jhonen Vasquez to make a kid's show was...probably not the smartest of ideas to begin with, but turned out fantastically. It was definitely not suited for the station though. For a few examples:
<ul><li> In the episode "Bestest Friend," Zim befriends an Earth child, and later rips his eyes out; even the fact it's only shown in the shadows doesn't dilute it much. (Though, as Jhonen said, he did get a new pair of eyes.)
<ul><li> Just as bad, or worse, is when he falls off the roof of a house after being attacked by a squirrel the eyes made him believe was Zim. The column of smoke implies that the eyes either malfunctioned or exploded when he hit the ground. Supposedly, the only reason he didn't end up pulling a Kenny (dying in more than one episode) was because the network wouldn't allow it.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there was "Dark Harvest," which had Zim going around stealing children's organs and jamming them into himself.
</li><li> Or "Bad, Bad Rubber Piggy," where Zim slowly ruined Dib's life by throwing rubber pigs into a time machine, thus causing Dib to become more and more seriously damaged — <em>and eventually killing him.</em> (though he's eventually resurrected).
</li><li> "Lice" had a school infested by lice, a series of cruel "treatments," a hideous Louse Queen, and the clincher, — Zim's skin can kill lice. After the threat is eliminated, we get to see a <em>skinned-alive</em> Zim writhing around screaming "THE PAIN!"''
</li><li> "Bolognius Maximus" turned Dib and Zim into sausages. Sure, they hit the reset button right after, but the damage would be done at that point.
</li><li> In the episode "Hamstergeddon" Peepi the class hamster is tampered with by Zim and he becomes a giant monster that begins to eat the students (we see him pull them under the floor and we hear crunching sounds), he then goes on a rampage and steps on many people, at the end of the episode was a message saying that no hamsters or people were harmed, that was probably the only way Jhonen was able to get away with it.
<ul><li> In the DVD commentary he constantly and explicitly says "she's dead/he's dead". Then he goes on about the large amount of people who died <em>during</em> the message saying that no one was harmed!
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Game Slave 2" had Gaz stalking Iggins, the stupid little boy who lied about a preorder and bought the last Game Slave 2 after she'd been waiting in line for hours to get it. It appeared, at the end of the episode, as if Gaz had killed Iggins (after making sure that he'd never have batteries for the system again) but, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">because Nickelodeon execs took umbrage at this</a>, they tacked on the wildly out of place "Flying Iggins" ending.
</li><li> In "The Frycook from Outer Space" at one point to escape from his job which he hates he hides himself inside a taco which allows a fat alien to eat him and therefore doesn't allow the laser to fry him when he goes by, after leaving the restaurant he bursts out of the alien's stomach leaving a gaping hole in him and spilling his stomach contents on the ground, it didn't seem to bother the alien much.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> has a bad habit of playing incredible violence against minimally superpowered foes as being slapstick or perfectly harmless, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">it should have maimed or killed the person</a>. Countless guns are blown up in people's hands with little more than a flinch, thieves slipping and landing on their heads, entire blocks being blown up complete with people panicking, that sorta thing. A nasty example would be the fate of the vile Steven Mandragora. The episode "Double Date" holds him as the Huntress's target, someone she is willing to kill to avenge the parents he killed before her very eyes, and while tough enough to take a punch or sonic wail, not particularly superpowered. The Huntress plans to kill him with a few crossbow bolts. In the episode's denouement, she has the option of killing him in front of his son or letting him back into police custody. Instead of executing him with the crossbow bolts, she refuses to kill and instead... drops a ton of steel I-beams on his head from at least a hundred feet up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> practically revolves around this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> Mr. Cat will use a variety of weapons on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Quack Quack</a>, and in the end he himself will be horribly beaten up (or worse) by Bad Kaeloo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness">Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Sight For Sore Eyes" the villain Junjie takes over the Jade Palace. After Chao comes back to check, an arrow is shot at him from a group of snow leopards. He catches it... and is promptly shot by a dozen more. Complete with violent sounds. While he doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">die,</a> he is severely wounded and imprisoned. Makes you have second wonders about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">such a lighthearted show...</a>
</li><li> In the one hour special "Enter the Dragon", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> needs to remove the legendary Hero's Chi from Po, which he does by sticking him in a giant funnel and literally <em>crushing it out of him.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">This ends up killing him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em> is aimed at preschoolers and airs on <em>Disney Junior</em>, an early childhood aimed network. Despite this its level of violence is on par with cartoon aimed at elementary schoolers. Fights are not bloody but can look rather painful.
</li><li> Ironically, this is much less common in Warner Bros' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> cartoons, where the impact of the violence is often blunted by the recipient's reactions to it (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofFunny">the usual cartoon exaggeration</a>. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> can be shot point-blank with a gun, and come out with nothing more than a misaligned bill and frustration towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> for getting the upper hand once again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMarvelousMisadventuresOfFlapjack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMarvelousMisadventuresOfFlapjack">The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack</a></em> has Captain K'nuckles's story about how he got two wooden hands: When he was a kid he stuck one hand in the garbage disposal, which was <em>hand-operated</em>. Since he couldn't afford to buy a fake hand, he carved a replica of one he saw in a pawn shop... but it was for the wrong hand so he <em>cut off his other hand</em> and carved another replica for the first hand he lost. Later in that same episode, Flapjack calls K'nuckles a liar, so a gang of people come out, says he stole all his stuff until <em>he was reduced to a pair of eyeballs and one wood hand</em>.
</li><li> Given that a large chunk of its characters were robots, Ruby-Spears' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> was able to get away with dismembering or otherwise mutilating them (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">but not on FOX</a>), with key examples including—
<ul><li> Various robots being torn to pieces by Snake Man's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone">Search Snake</a> weapon.
</li><li> Fire Man getting pulled apart by Roll's vacuum arm in <em>"The Beginning"</em>. There's also the threat towards Doctor Light (a human) by Doctor Wily in the flashback— warning him not to follow him, otherwise Ice Man would freeze him alive, and then Cut Man would <em>slice him apart</em>.
</li><li> Guts Man getting a basketball-sized hole blown through his chest with an X-Buster shot in <em>"Mega X"</em>, and having his head literally ripped off his neck by one of the dolls in "Crime of the Century".
</li><li> Roll is seen battling a berserk female cosmetics robot who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">gave her a bad facial</a> in <em>"Electric Nightmare"</em>. It's a fairly standard cartoony fight until the end— where Roll uses her buzzsaw arm attachment to slice the robot in half across her stomach, her upper half falling to the floor, before Roll switches to her vacuum arm and <em>tears her face off</em>.
</li><li> After the attack on Doctor Light's lab in <em>"The Big Shake"</em>, there's not much keeping Mega Man's right arm attached to his body. Similarly, Crystal Man gets his arm blown off at the elbow in <em>"The Mega Man in the Moon"</em>, and is still shown with the wound near the end of the episode.
</li><li> Dark Man is reduced to a torso, half an arm, and his head towards the end of <em>"The Day the Moon Fell"</em>, and he's still completely aware of this- even having to drag himself around with his lone arm because no one will carry him when his fellow Robot Masters flee.
</li><li> The disruptor chip placed on Mega Man in <em>"Bro Bots"</em> essentially sent severe electric shocks directly to his "brain". It's supposed to "scramble [his] circuits", but the SFX suggest otherwise.
<ul><li> In the same episode, you had Needle Man's first "death" in the Museum scene. He initially threatens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Proto Man</a> (who was pretending to be good at the time to fool Mega Man and his family), but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">Psycho Prototype</a> simply walks up to him, reminds him of their plan, and then proceeds to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreTheseWiresImportant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreTheseWiresImportant">open him up and </a><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/xNsaP4lsgdw?t=5m24s">rip a fistful of wires out of him<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">throwing his still-spasming body at</a> Heat Man. Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">he got repaired later</a>, but even for this show's standards, that was just brutal.
</li></ul></li><li> Hard Man's demise in "Bad Day at Peril Park". He's shown blocking Mega Man's Buster shots with his armour, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">taunting him all the while</a> until Mega Man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb">fires a charged shot into his mouth</a>. This causes Hard Man to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">panic and frantically claw at himself as he realises what's happening</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsExplosion">before he swells up and explodes from the inside</a>. Now normally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">this wouldn't be so bad</a>— but Hard Man is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">literally blown to pieces,</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/3-PXy_rFPsM?t=4m21s">with machinery and internal mechanisms scattered everywhere<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Mega Man even picks up one of his disembodied arms (With torn wires and framework hanging out of it) to attain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Hard Knuckle</a> afterward.
</li><li> In "Crime of the Century", Proto Man fired his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Arm Cannon</a> into a room of <em>humans</em>. And they didn't move afterward, heavily implying that he actually killed them, <em>on-screen</em>.
<ul><li> It's not even the first time Proto Man has directly threatened human beings— in "Bro Bots", his revelation as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole">HeelFace Mole</a> in that episode is met with resistance. So how does he keep the heroes under control? By threatening to shoot a nearby governor in the head—
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Proto Man:</strong> Now power down, or I'll give Deacon a <em>plasma shave</em>!
</div></li><li> Worst of all however, had to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">the implications</a> in a scene from "Brain Bots"— where Doctor Wily places Mega Man into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> consisting of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling">Descending Ceiling</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a>, and with Mega Man strapped to the floor to ensure he can't escape. Fair enough, but what pushes it into this was what Wily said about it; that he uses it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">"recycle robots he no longer needs into scrap metal"</a>, meaning that <em><strong>he's done it to his own robots.</strong></em> Considering as well that several Robot Masters— including Fire Man, Gravity Man, Dive Man, and Star Man— only appeared in one episode and were never seen nor mentioned again afterward, that speaks volumes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PigGoatBananaCricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PigGoatBananaCricket">Pig Goat Banana Cricket</a></em> has lots of this:
<ul><li> In Fudge Apocalypse, Pig gets shot with lazers.
</li><li> In Zombie Broheims, Banana pulls out some Zombies organs.
</li><li> In Prince Mermeow Moves In, Prince Mermeow almost gets his head chopped off by a guillotine.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> would punch animals and turn them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsMeetTheMeat">meat products</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAndLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAndLoathing">fur coats</a>.
<ul><li> Happens to birds in the <em>Popeye</em> versions of both <em>Sindbad the Sailor</em> and <em>Aladdin</em>.

The most violent things tend to happen to the monsters they fought, who sometimes get decapitated, torn in half, impaled, or ripped limb from limb. One of the most disturbing examples is where the girls get addicted to candy to the point where it's treated like a drug addiction. When Mojo Jojo betrays their trust of rewarding them with the candy by stealing it, they beat him to the point where he is hideously deformed and has blood dripping from his mouth. They seem to leave Mojo in that state a lot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> was full of this: Ren would often abuse Stimpy usually by slapping him or hitting him with any object he could find, and Ren often had some of the worst of the violence done to him like getting hit by a car and reduced to a bloody mess, having his lower body stripped to the bone by a buzzard, having his skin, blood, and organs sucked out by a vaccum cleaner, smashed to a messy puddle with a shovel, electrocuted, set on fire, etc. One episode was banned after one late night airing which included a scene where Ren brutally beat his owner George Liquor with an oar. This episode also was one of the reasons for creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>'s firing.
<ul><li> "Magical Golden Singing Cheeses" is known by many fans as the single most violent episode. It includes a scene where a court jester scrapes his elbow with a cheese grater, then rubs it with a lemon, and then pours salt on it. Another even more disturbing scene comes later when Stimpy accidentally stabs a giant's toe with a crow bar, prying off the giant's toe nail.
</li><li> Blood has also been displayed several times in the show. One, in "Sven Hoek", where Ren threatens Stimpy and Sven - while saying the line "<em>tear</em> your arms out of the sockets" and very realistically imitating the action, a blood spray is visible for a brief moment.
<ul><li> Also, at the end of "The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen", in a scene where hats are being thrown up with triumph, there's a very indiscreet shot of a bleeding intestine in the air.
</li><li> There were plenty of bloody bandages in a Games episode (oddly), "Ren's Pecs".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> was full of this, even if blood is usually absent.

As a matter of fact, several episodes received a TV-PG-V rating for this.
<ul><li> First off, we have the massive gunfight in the episode "Steak Me Amadeus".
</li><li> Also, the way Skips nearly died in "Free Cake" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">horrible way to go</a>, where he starts to skeletonize, while his flesh crumbles to dust.
</li><li> The bear animatronic being shot and exploded in "Fuzzy Dice", only offshoot by him being a robot.
</li><li> Skips slamming Rigby into a table and killing him in "Over the Top".
</li><li> Much of the zombie violence from "Grave Sights", where zombies were decapitated, impaled, among others.
</li><li> At the end of "But I Have a Receipt", Mordecai stabs the store clerk in the chest with a ruler.
</li><li> In "Firework Run", Hector was killed after being blown up by his own firework.
</li></ul></li><li> The earlier episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> were full of this. Scenes include:
<ul><li> An ox getting his arms ripped off by arm crunchers with blood spraying from his stumps in "No Pain, No Gain".
</li><li> A bird smoking a cigarette coughs up his heart in "Flu-In-U-Enza".
</li><li> A dog belonging to a shark tears a man's leg off with blood dripping from it in "Sand in Your Navel" .
</li><li> Heffer's face is ripped off while riding a roller coaster, exposing his skull in "Carnival Knowledge".
</li><li> Really Really Bigman ripping off people's arms to give them autographs and tossing a child into the sun in "Power Trip".
</li><li> Rocko getting attacked by Earl the bulldog and emerging with a bloody nose and a chunk bitten out of his tail in "Ed is Dead: A Thriller".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em> was working with rather mature source material and adapting it for seven year olds, so had to tone down the characters' bloodier excesses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">and replace their guns with tanks and flamethrowers</a>). It still leaks into this pretty frequently, though. An example is an episode where Sam and Max raise a baby alligator, and discover it won't eat any food except off Max's arm. His arm gets increasingly mangled throughout the episode, until eventually he mentions he's lost all sensation in it, and they both giggle about it. <em>The Effigy Mound</em>, a (now out-of-print) Sam &amp; Max sketchbook, features some of the censors' notes from the show. It becomes readily apparent that they weren't any more clued in about this whole "Sam &amp; Max" business <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">than the people who thought it would make for a good kids' show in the first place.</a>
</li><li> The entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> series veers between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious">Bloody Hilarious</a>. Every fight scene with robots involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBlood">Symbolic Blood</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">High-Pressure Blood</a> to a ridiculous degree. In numerous cases Jack ends the fight liberally soaked in oil and standing on a mountain of dismembered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> parts. And also in battle sometimes Jack would get full of bloody cuts all over his body. This is actually a parody/homage of samurai films' brutal deaths of combatants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> is full of this in spades. Ironic, considering the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> franchise originated out of response to complaints of too much violence on Saturday morning TV in the late 1960s. Amazingly with all of the carnage and destruction and even a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">family-unfriendly deaths</a>, the show still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">got away with a TV-Y7-FV rating!</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> has many instances throughout its long run, and not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">deaths</a>. If characters aren't killed by lightsaber impalements on-screen, we sometimes have characters getting their limbs dislocated and in some cases, cut off on-screen or tortured (sometimes with visible cuts and bruises in the later seasons). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they were able to get away with this a lot because it was a continuation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">films</a>, which already had plenty of the same type of violence themselves. And it was marketed to both kids and adults alike.
<ul><li> Probably the most extreme of these was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riff Tamson</span> getting <em>blown to bits</em> completely onscreen. And no, we don't mean blown to bits in the sense that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PGExplosives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PGExplosives">there's an explosion where he was standing and then the body just disappears</a>", we actually see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">scattered body parts</a>, including a close-up on his <strong>head</strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> sometimes contains this, though it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">generally only happens to alien characters</a>:
<ul><li> The episode "Steven the Sword Fighter" has Pearl getting impaled by her sword-wielding hologram-clone. The fact that she's going to be fine thanks to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> isn't explained until <em>after</em> Steven starts crying over her gem because he thinks she's dead (though Pearl herself does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence">try to tell him before her body disappears</a>).
</li><li> The episode "The Return" has <a class="urllink" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=67xFiC_O790">this fun scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> involving Garnet <em>brutally getting cut in half while her limbs fall apart</em> onscreen.
</li><li> In "Bubbled", the Ruby nicknamed "Eyeball" tries to <em>stab Steven with a chisel.</em>
</li><li> However, all of this pales in comparison to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">Lars's death.</a> When Lars jumps on top of a Shattering Robonoid, it <em>explodes</em>. Lars goes flying into a wall with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeningCrunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeningCrunch">Sickening "Crunch!"</a> and falls a good thirty feet to the floor. While this is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a>, it doesn't make the scene any less shocking, especially since it comes <em>entirely</em> out of nowhere</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">movie</a> ends up providing us with some entertaining moments that kids can enjoy, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Crystal Gems outright being cut in half along with the villain Spinel being sliced through, both via scythe, shortly after, and Spinel actually making Steven bleed during their fight at the movie's climax, the first time any kind of blood was shown in the series.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats">SWAT Kats</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The Giant Bacteria," Dr. Viper puts a drop of something-or-other onto Morbulus' arm, causing him to start turning into the title monster. The transformation is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> and presented as incredibly painful, as Morbulus turns into a fizzing purple mass and screams in an increasingly distorted, pained voice. Worst of all is when his head transforms; he has eyes in the back of his head and they move up to the front while he's changing.
</li><li> In "The Metallikats," the eponymous robot gangsters get pretty violently destroyed. In particular, Mac malfunctions and explodes, and one of his eyes rolls into Mayor Manx's "putt cup" (that thing you hit a golf ball into when playing office golf), while Molly falls off of the Turbokat while trying to kill T-Bone, and we see her hit the street and explode onscreen. But because they're robots, they are revealed to have survived at the end.
</li><li> In "Chaos In Crystal," convict turned giant crystal monster Rex Shard is shattered into pieces by a sonic boom from the Turbokat. Bizarrely, this doesn't kill him, it just causes him to return to normal size, alive but unconscious (implying he was only "giant" because of several layers of crystal armor).
</li><li> In "Katastrophe," Dr. Viper's mushroom monster assistant takes the full force of an explosion and ends up splattered all over the Turbokat. Because he's amorphous, he's later revealed to have reconstituted himself offscreen (presumably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2">T-1000</a> style).
</li><li> In "The Deadly Pyramid," plucky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a> endures a <em>lot</em> of punishment at the hands of the giant mummies, who fling him violently against buildings. He is eventually so damaged he can only lie on the sidewalk, twitching pathetically as he attempts to move. And unlike Mac and Molly, we never do get confirmation that he's survived.
</li><li> In "Unlikely Alloys," there's more violence against the Metallikats as Mac gets grabbed by Zed's metal tentacles, lifted into the air, and pulled apart and assimilated as Molly watches screaming in horror. However, his consciousness survives inside of Zed. At the end of the episode, he and Molly (who got assimilated as well) are revealed to be just fine again although a little worse for wear.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymbionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymbionicTitan">Symbionic Titan</a></em>. Aside from the brutal monster battles, some of the human fights can get pretty intense as well. "The Fortress of Deception" features a scene where Lance is taken in for questioning. He is tortured by getting shocked and beaten by a large muscular man, blood is seen trickling from his mouth and he spits some of it out, later that same man is seen lying on the floor in a puddle of blood and teeth.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Haunted." It's half-an-hour of a grown man viciously pummeling a teenage boy, while all the boy's friends refuse to believe his attacker exists. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The attacker <em>didn't</em> exist. Which meant that to the friends, <em>he was beating himself up</em>. And was at one point clearly diagnosed as being under so much stress (for fear of the imaginary attacker) that it was damaging his health.</span>
</li><li> For implied violence, the various <em>mutilations</em> that happen to Baxter Stockman in the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> series qualify to an almost ridiculous degree:
<ul><li> The first time he fails the foot clan he had an eye removed.
</li><li> The second time he ended up in a wheelchair and was missing his arm.
</li><li> After his first robot body is destroyed, he's reduced to a head connected to a spider-bot.
</li><li> After escaping, he's then found again by the Foot and reduced to <em>a brain, an eye, and a spinal cord</em>.
</li><li> He eventually makes a new organic body, but it ends up rapidly decaying and driving him insane.
</li><li> Finally, after the body is destroyed, he's revived as a brain in a jar again, even though <em>he was actually wishing he'd died</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em> has several examples. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a> applies, it's still quite shocking:
<ul><li> In "The Gauntlet," the Shredder dishes out an absolutely <em>brutal</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> on the Turtles, including kicking Raphael into an electrified sign and Michelangelo being crushed and stuck under pieces of said sign.
</li><li> Slash in "Slash and Destroy," who severely wounds Donnie offscreen, smashes Mikey around, and has an absolutely brutal fight against Raph. Even when Leo joins the fray, he's quickly and painfully smacked off to one side.
</li><li> In the second season finale, Leatherhead violently mauls Shredder by shaking him like a rag doll in his powerful jaws.
</li><li> In the third season finale, Shredder <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">runs Splinter through with his blades, killing him.</span>
</li><li> In "The Tale of Tiger Claw," it's revealed in a flashback that Alopex cut off Tiger Claw's tail, and currently wears it <em>as a belt</em>. Not only that, but at the end of the episode, she slices off Tiger Claw's right arm, <em>on-screen</em>, as a warning that she could just as easily have taken his life.
</li><li> In "Requiem," <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rahzar is dragged to the bottom of a river by Leatherhead and drowned. Splinter is killed by Shredder once again, stabbed through the back, and this time his body is flung off of a high building, eliminating any chance of survival</span>.
</li><li> In "Owari," Shredder <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is killed when his head is sliced off by Leo, who then carries it with him and throws it on the ground contemptuously</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, despite being a beloved and classic cartoon, is famous for having some of the most violent gags ever devised in theatrical animation, especially the older episodes. These include Jerry slicing Tom in half, shutting his head in a window or a door, Tom using everything from axes, pistols, explosives, traps and poison to try to murder Jerry, Jerry stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron, kicking him into a refrigerator, plugging his tail into an electric socket, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, causing a tree to drive him into the ground and so on. Luckily, these are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>, so there is no blood and gore.
<ul><li> Oddly enough though, the closest the series ever came to blood was in the recent direct to video film <em>Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars</em> which features Tom attempting to grab Jerry only to crush a tomato. This leads Tom to believe that he <em>crushed Jerry's body to the point that his hand is covered with Jerry's blood</em>.
<ul><li> Later in the same movie, the Martians decide to invade Earth. When they get there, one of the lovable astronauts we had been watching throughout the movie gets up and confronts one of the aliens face-to-face, remarking that he didn't look too tough. The alien gets angry, so he whips out his ray gun and actually vaporizes the astronaut, reducing him to a pile of ash. The aliens then decide to go on a rampage, and start vaporizing every innocent civilian in sight, while you hear their screams of pain. It's not gory, but it's not done in a cartoony style, making it traumatizing and out-of-place in a Tom and Jerry movie.
</li><li> One cartoon directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> contained another 'false gore' scene. The storyline involved Jerry and another mouse playing malicious pranks on Tom to make him believe he was attacking himself in his sleep. They tried lowering a hangman's noose where he was sleeping, placing a gun on a string nearby, and other stuff. Then the mice poured ketchup on Tom's belly while he was asleep, covered a knife with ketchup, and put the knife in Tom's hand. When Tom woke up, he thought the ketchup on the knife and his belly, was blood, and that he'd accidentally stabbed himself. When he found out what the mice were doing, he shoved them in a bottle, rigged with a gun that would go off if they tried to escape.
</li></ul></li><li> There is an episode during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> with Tom messing up a fancy dinner while trying to catch Jerry and another mouse, and being sentenced to death. The last scene is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a> showing a faraway guillotine with drums playing. The drums stop, the blade drops, and there is this visceral, organic <em>"chok!"</em> sound you hear in your nightmares for the next ten years.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the direct-to-DVD movie <em>The Fast and the Furry</em>, in which a large number of secondary characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">rather messily</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. To elaborate, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a mother of four is heavily implied to be devoured by jungle insects, a man is cooked alive by a mermaid, a little old lady and her dog fall to their deaths, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> is vaporized, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> is disintegrated</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> goes full-throttle with this.

<ul><li> Later we get to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Car Fu</a> where the Autobots run cars off the road and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">blowing up</a> at least one of them, with <em>human</em> mooks inside. As a bonus, this is apparently acceptable for Optimus's order to use MINIMAL force.
</li><li> In "One Shall Fall" Optimus goes all out on Megatron. He grinds his truck wheels <em>into Megatron's face</em> and then punches hard enough to spill energon, more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineBlood">Machine Blood</a>. You wouldn't <em>want</em> to see what that would have looked like on a regular human.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> franchise has a history of this, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> is no exception. It's rare for an episode to end without at least one or two cast members (one of whom is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">Waspinator</a>) having been grievously wounded during its runtime.
</li><li> The short "Willie the Operatic Whale" ends with the opera manager harpooning Willie, who's shown thrashing about in the water in a far less cartoony style than the rest of the short has, while the manager gleefully cries "I gotta heem, I gotta heem!"
</li><li> This trope comes up a lot in super-hero cartoons. Take <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. We've got two scenes of stabbing (in one of them you can see the knife <em>go through the hero's back</em>)— <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they're both fake, in one way or another, but still creepy</span>. One of the stand-out examples would be Black Beetle slamming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a>'s body repeatedly against a wall for <em>ten seconds</em> while we get flashes to all her unconscious teammates.

Among them, getting set on fire, losing all skin, and getting cut in half. Later, SpongeBob shrinks every single citizen of Bikini Bottom. They get their revenge on him by invading his body - he HAS holes everywhere, so invading wasn't much of a problem for them - and <em>crushing him from the inside</em>. This includes breaking his bones, destroying his kidney, punching out his eyes and brain... Yes, it did look creepy and painful.

</li><li> "Restraining Spongebob" has Squidward <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">fried alive</a></em>.
</li><li> "Walking the Plankton" has Plankton cut in half by a propeller.
</li><li> "The Splinter" is the shining example of this trope: Spongebob gets an oversized splinter <em>slowly</em> wedged <em>deep</em> into his thumb (whereabouts in reality, something this deep in your thumb would be scraping the bone by now). Spongebob tries several painfully unsuccessful attempts to remove it which are cringeworthy because they're what real victims of splinters would go through if they couldn't get the splinter out. Spongebob is tearing up from the pain, and he calls "Doctor" Patrick to help, but his so-called "help" consists of <strong>hammering the splinter further into his thumb</strong> so that it swells horrendously, and then the most disgusting part of the episode by miles, dumping garbage on the splinter wound so that it infects and bleeds pus. In the end, Mr. Krabs removes the splinter and it sprays pus all over his face.
</li><li> "Naughty Nautical Neighbors" has Squidward choke on a fork and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen">fall over with his eyes open.</a>
</li><li> "Ugh" has Patar<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ok3y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ok3y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ok3y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the caveman version of Patrick</span> impale himself through his lips with a stick that he tried to eat.
</li><li> In "Pineapple Fever" Squidward is plucking his eyebrows and accidentally rips one off.
</li><li> In "Two Faces of Squidward", Spongebob hits Squidward's face with a door repeatedly, and you can hear Squidward's bones cracking as he groans in pain.
</li><li> In "SpongeBob Meets The Strangler", SpongeBob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">jumps on the titular Strangler's eyes while wearing cleats.</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Strangler:</strong> AAAUGH!!! Get your feet out of my eye sockets!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>SpongeBob:</strong> I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!
</div></li><li> The episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">"Mall Girl Pearl"</a> has the manager of Hot Dogs On A String cooked alive. Somewhat subverted when it turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction">he's still alive, albeit badly burned</a>.
</li><li> In Sportz, Squidward Tentacles makes Patrick slice SpongeBob in half, and we can see his brain, ribcage, and intestines rather clearly. After this, their legs become very swollen, pulsating, and red.
