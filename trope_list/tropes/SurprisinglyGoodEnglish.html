<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"I'll chisel your gravestone. Sleep well!"</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Wolfgang Krauser</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a> 2</em>, proving that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a> can get it right when it comes to proper English.
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The sounds used in non-English languages are often very different from the sounds in the English language, and combine in very different ways from anything used in Western speech. The closer a language is to English, the more approximate the sounds/language will be, but there are still situations where the non-English language has sounds that English doesn't, and lacks sounds that English does have. General American English has 13 vowels, 28 consonants, and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">diphthongs than you can dip a thong at,</a> they're not all going to match up to every other language in the world.
</p><p>The result of all this is that when you hear enough language produced with the "wrong" sounds, your ear becomes trained to it, and it sounds natural. Then, when those same voices speak English with English sounds, it's like ice water down the back of the neck. If you can imagine Andy Kaufman dropping his Latka accent in the middle of an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>, you might understand what this sounds like.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Makes sense when you think about it. For many people around the world (especially continental Europe) developing highly advanced English skills is considered an inextricable part of joining the global, internationalist elite. Some of the errors commonly made by many native speakers of English will hardly ever happen in extra-Anglophone circles, where people will strive to make their English as grammatically correct as possible, which is why the likes of the omission of the Pluperfect tense ("had been", "had done" etc.), omnipresent in American English, will be rather hard to come by in when listening to a speaker of English from, say, Scandinavia.
</p><p>Similarily, since the vast majority of the non-English speaking global population will start learning both the spoken and written variant of English at roughly the same time (as opposed to native speakers who will spend at least a couple of years just listening to English before they begin to read it), you will rarely see them confusing phonetically close yet visually and semantically distant phrases, such as "your" and "you're".

It's also worth noting that some non-native English speakers, especially if they've been studying and using English since an early age, may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplimentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplimentBackfire">get rubbed the wrong way</a> if they take your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">surprise</a> as a statement that someone from their country shouldn't be capable of achieving fluency.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GuinSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GuinSaga">Guin Saga</a></em>'s song "This is My Road" has English lyrics, which aren't broken.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em> has some surprisingly good English going on throughout the entire series. The Unicorn's AI speaks fluent English, and in the beginning of episode 1, assuming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>, we hear the prime minister speaking Japanese, and he is actually speaking really good English faintly in the background. There is also episode 5 which at the beginning has a whole dialogue in English, although one of the participants speaks with a heavy Asian accent. And then there's the contents of Laplace's Box <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka The original Universal Century Charter</span> as revealed in Episode 7, which is written in perfectly good English, being an official document and all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> (the Japanese version) features some somewhat accented but quite understandable English. For example, just listen to Allelujah in Episode 6 of Season 2 say "I have control".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> both feature ending themes (the third and first, respectively) which transition from Japanese to grammatically-correct English flawlessly. This should probably come as no surprise since the singer of both songs, Rie fu, spent four years in America and speaks English fluently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters">Gundam Build Fighters</a></em> contains a surprising amount of accurate English text. To give just two examples: Episode 8 has Nils Neilsen research his upcoming opponent Greco Logan online, and can be seen reading a fully-written article about Greco's rivalry with Italian champ Ricardo Fellini. Likewise, Episode 18 shows the Renato brothers reading message board posts praising Meijin Kawaguchi III, one of which contains the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Pun</a> "Is he amazing because he's A-Meijin?".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> is famous for the way the series title is announced as "TURN A. GUNDAM." in both OPs by what <em>sounds</em> like a deep-voiced Brit... in fact, a deep-voiced Japanese man.
</li><li> Steer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG">Gundam: Reconguista in G</a></em> became a fan favorite (in spite of not having a role beyond, well, steering the ship) for the way she announced her actions in loud, well-pronounced, usually singular English words.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries">anime series</a> has an episode about a ghost haunting people that played her Rock records. The song, "Future in my Hands" by Aimee B, is surprisingly well spoken English. Then again, this one probably shouldn't be "surprisingly", since her full name is Aimee Blackschleger and she is an American singer who moved to Japan for her career.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> TK can speak perfect English. It probably helps that his VA is American, and also that he doesn't have many lines in the anime. What he actually SAYS, though, ventures wholeheartedly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> territory. "Dive into your body!"
</li><li> Momoko on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em> is nearly a native English speaker, and learned Japanese shortly after being introduced as a character. Her lines in English- even a simple "Yeah!"- can be quite shocking when unexpected and all this despite having a local VA. Nami Miyahara moved with her family to Austria when she was young, and she speaks <em>almost</em> fluent English and German because of that. Similarly, Momoko moved to America with her family and lived there for most of her childhood. It should be noted, however, that one episode has her referring to her earring as a "pierce", which is the Japanese translation for earring.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> movie, <em>Supreme Evolution! The Golden Digimentals!</em>, starred Wallace, an American character who was <em>also</em> voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NamiMiyahara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NamiMiyahara">Nami Miyahara</a>. Many people didn't even believe it was a single voice actress. Amusingly, she still pronounced his name "Warrace" (most likely because she was instructed to, in order for the Japanese audience to understand) which was odd considering how fluently she spoke every other English word. The other characters do speak English occasionally in this film as it takes place in America; while it's mainly common phrases (good luck, thank you, see you soon, etc), they get them right.
</li><li> The opening and ending songs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss">Super Dimension Century Orguss</a></em> have perfectly pronounced English within both. This can be contributed to the fact that their singer, Casey Rankin, was raised in the United States until the age of 25 before moving to Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> has English voice actors for the main characters' magic devices. In the first season, their lines are relatively grammatical, but in the second season, they have extended lines with more questionable grammar. Similarly with the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl35Y0z1Dnc">German devices<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—their collective VA, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaKakihara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaKakihara">Tetsuya Kakihara</a>, was raised in Düsseldorf.
<ul><li> As is often the case in the voice recording business, although the hired voice actors are perfectly fluent in their respective languages, they have virtually no authority in changing the script, even if to improve it. Their clunky delivery, however, is apparently deliberate to emphasize their artificiality.
</li><li> Although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> of the first season had the devices speaking very good English.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CControl">[C] - Control</a></em>, ATMs and Negotiations use English. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Jennifer's</a> boss at the International Monetary Fund is also voiced by a native English speaker, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Jennifer is not</a> (since that character is not a bit part, most of her lines are in Japanese).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraWarsTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraWarsTheMovie">Sakura Wars: The Movie</a></em>, Maria delivers a couple of lines in near-flawless English and manages something vaguely akin to a New Yorker accent, since (despite being Russian) she was supposed to have lived in New York for a while before coming to Japan. Ironically, the "American" characters in the movie speak typical Engrish.
<ul><li> With the exception of Ratchet, who's pronunciation (with the exception of "please") and inflection are actually pretty decent, as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yq3Js_FlYw">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Though not voiced by one of the characters, the opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> has the seemingly mandatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> sung in <em>exceptionally</em> good English, as the singer was raised in the US.
</li><li> The soundtrack to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em> features several songs primarily in English, the main vocalist being American singer <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bindiger">Emily Bindiger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Ozaru and Kozaru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan">Jubei-chan 2</a></em> have an "English Interlude" specifically because they hope that the show is becoming popular in the States.
</li><li> The baseball episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> features Admiral Joy Cartwright and his translator being voiced by- gasp- actual Americans. (Inverted possibly by the translator's Surprisingly Good Japanese?) The opening theme to the series, "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OuRajFzMYI">Battlecry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", was also done by someone who knows how to actually speak English: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shing02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shing02">Shing 02</a>, who had the benefit of a champloo-ish upbringing born in Tokyo; childhood in Tanzania, England, and Japan; and adolescence in the States.
<ul><li> As a side note, the episode with the Dutch East India Company contains some Surprisingly Good Dutch too.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4GoldenTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4GoldenTheAnimation">Persona 4 Golden: The Animation</a></em>, as with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">the original game</a>, feature intro songs performed in perfect English. Some of the lyrics themselves are a bit shaky ("It's constantly costuming with lots of fake") but the performances are flawless.
</li><li> Honey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>. "I'm... still... sleepy...!" and the hired American film crew ("Yes, boss!")
<ul><li> Words cannot express how creepy and startling Honey's line is when you first hear it, what with the differences in voice and this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana">Nana</a></em> is full of good English, from the songs that various cast members sing to various lines they say. When Shin says "Good night, Rena, sweet dreams", it's actually shocking how good his English is, considering this is the first time he's used it. It's fitting, since the character was raised in America; being a series with no small amount of time dedicated to vocalists <em>Nana</em> pays a lot of attention to the accuracy of its voice acting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK">Beck</a></em>, where all the American characters speak ludicrously bad Engrish aside from John Lee Davis — who sounds, for some reason, remarkably like Martin Sheen...
<ul><li> Quite a few characters in <em>BECK</em> are voiced by American expats - Leon Sykes, his henchman Goldie, Dying Breed, and the director of their documentary (that doesn't necessarily mean they can <em>act</em>, however). Two songs from the soundtrack, "My World Down" and "I Call You Love", are by British singers Gary Stringer and Mark Gardener, with lyrics by Tim Jensen, best known for his work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno">Yoko Kanno</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> amongst them).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodTheLastVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodTheLastVampire">Blood: The Last Vampire</a></em> has an American military base on Okinawa as the setting, and all the dialogue in English is done by American voice actors, with several characters having double cast (this also highlights the difference in acting levels, with English VAs being noticeably wooden but over the top, but that's a different story.) Seeing as Blood was done before a lot of major series caused anime to take off in America, the fact that the VAs are actually not bad, if not a little wooden, is quite impressive.
</li><li> Maybe not quite as perfect as the previous one, but the <em>Tonight, Tonight, Tonight</em> song that is also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> makes enough sense that any minor mistakes are forgivable.
<ul><li> Listen to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeroTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeroTales">Hero Tales</a></em> opening, and try to figure out what they're saying. It's the same guys.
</li><li> Many of the opening and ending songs combine Surprisingly Good English and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> with the Japanese in varying amounts.
</li><li> The first ending song, Rie Fu's "Life is Like a Boat". It helps that she speaks fluent English from living in Maryland for three years and going to school in London.
</li><li> Ichigo's theme song, "Number One", is sung in absolutely perfect English. It's a woman's choir in a rock song. It's really weird, but catchy.
</li><li> A recurring song, "Nothing Can Be Explained", is in English and performed by a British singer - the guy who wrote the lyrics for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Komm, süsser Tod</a>, in fact. It's difficult to tell in show since his voice is rather faint, but it's clear on the soundtrack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> likes to play everything backwards, and has both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> and Surprisingly Good English side by side. None of the voice actors can pronounce English very well, and mangle the random English phrases. The opening themes are written almost entirely in Surprisingly Good English and Surprisingly Good <em>Russian</em>, with some verses even in <em>Surprisingly Good Latin</em>. The actual reason for this is the performer, Origa (Olga), being originally Russian.
<ul><li> The opening shot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">the original film</a> contains simultaneous English and Japanese voiceovers; the soundtrack of the second film contains two songs - "River of Crystals" and "Follow Me" - sung in slightly accented but grammatically correct, intelligible English by Kimiko Ito, the former of which was composed by Kenji Kawai specifically for the film.
</li></ul></li><li> "Blue", the ending theme for the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, is in flawless English. In fact, half the songs by The Seatbelts with lyrics are in Surprisingly Good English, thanks in no small part to Yamane Mai and American-born singers Emily Bindiger and Steve Conte, who between the three of them sing the vast majority of the series' English-language music.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> makes extensive use of Surprisingly Good English, from the opening theme to computer interfaces, C programming, English lessons, multiple allegedly historical documents, and different aspects of the <em>Wired</em>.
<ul><li> The opening theme is actually a song written by a now-defunct British band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoaUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoaUK">Boa</a>, which features two of Paul Rodgers' children. Hardly surprising the English was so good, really.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAKo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAKo">Project A-ko</a></em> has astronauts working on a space probe, and speaking perfect American English.
<ul><li> Also, <em>Project A-Ko</em> is reckoned to be the first anime ever to have had the soundtrack songs in the original Japanese version recorded entirely in English.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em> has a very brief scene in the first episode that can cause similar reactions.
</li></ul></li><li> There isn't much English in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, but there is lots of English writing on the computers screens, e.g. "God's in His Heaven, All's right With the World". All of it is perfect. All of it can be credited to translator Michael House, who was hired on as an in-house English consultant by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax">Studio Gainax</a> at the beginning of the show's production.
<ul><li> House himself even has a voice cameo in the intro scene for Episode 18, playing an American pilot communicating over radio with flight control, who are played by two of his friends. All dialogue in said scene is entirely in English, and translated with Japanese subtitles.
</li><li> <em>The End of Evangelion</em> has not one, but three songs (four, if you count the one cut from the final release of the film) sung in perfect, unaccented English with entirely sensible (and appropriate) lyrics. Of course, it helps that composer Shiro Sagisu went abroad to have these songs recorded by native English-speakers.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> Yurika addresses a United Earth Force assembly in English. Her accent is thick, but her pronunciation is much better than the supposedly English-speaking extras. Her exact words are, "We'd like to reach escape velocity from the Earth in three hours, <em>buuuuuuut</em>... if you don't put the Big Barrier down for a moment, the Nadesico and the barrier satellites will be damaged. Would you mind pulling the barrier down PLEEEEEEEASE??" When UEF refuses her request she then adds, "So, we'll break through the barrier forcibly!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai">Makoto Shinkai</a>'s movies <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoicesOfADistantStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoicesOfADistantStar">Voices of a Distant Star</a></em> (<em>Hoshi no koe</em>) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThePlacePromisedInOurEarlyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThePlacePromisedInOurEarlyDays">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a></em> (<em>Kumo no mukou, yakusoku no basho</em>) both feature English lines spoken by native speakers; in the former, it's a series of public address announcements on the ship <em>Lysithea</em> (Donna Burke, who also voiced <em>Nanoha's</em> Raising Heart), while in the latter, it's a brief conversation between an American intelligence agent and military officer. Oddly, though the accent is (naturally) perfect, the actual words are All-your-base-are-belong-to-us weird ("Their block exists in orbit").
</li><li> The four songs on also Shinkai-directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em>'s soundtrack were rerecorded with English lyrics by the original band RADWIMPS for the English dub and, with a few exceptions - like a gratuitous untranslated "zenzenzen" in "Zenzenzense" - RADWIMPS guitarist and vocalist Yojiro Noda's delivery is fluent and grammatical. It probably helped that he spent a few childhood years in the US.
</li><li> The voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyoHorikawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyoHorikawa">Ryo Horikawa</a> for Heiji Hattori in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> anime is proficient in English, leading to his character speaking better English than a character who is supposed to be American. When he was a child, his family hosted an American girl. He helped her learn Japanese, she helped him learn English. Also the anchorwoman from the 6th Detective Conan movie. Extremely unnerving having the first lines in a Japanese movie being in perfect English— <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as that's <em>Boston</em>, she's supposed to be a Boston-area news anchor.
</li><li> The opening animation for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JyuOhSei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JyuOhSei">Jyu-Oh-Sei</a></em> features approximately 50/50 Japanese and English. The English makes about as much sense as the rest of the song does, and there is relatively little accent or "Japanese-isms".
</li><li> Also, <em>Bleach's</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeMusicPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeMusicPowerUp">Theme Music Power-Up</a> song, <em>Number One</em>, a Motown-esque song sung entirely in English. It is a step more surprising, however, because the lead singer sounds distinctly African American. Which she is (sort of): the song is sung by UK artist Hazel Fernandes.
</li><li> The closing theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em>, "A Rising Tide", was written by a native English speaker and sung by a native Japanese speaker. Thus, the only time there's a goof involves the L/R problem - "give me my sword" sounds like "give me my soul".
</li><li> Thankfully, the English parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>'s "Libera Me from Hell" were very good, with a couple easily-ignored exceptions, such as pronouncing "don't" as "dahnt"
<ul><li> There's also Viral's theme music, "Nikopol", which is not only perfect English but also has lyrics that sum up Viral's philosophy very well.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeCatch">Eye Catch</a> sting, however- "<em>RAW! RAW!</em> FIGHT DA POWER!"- sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">"ROW ROW! WHITE POWER!"</a>.
</li><li> And the full version of the song is actually in quite good English (and has a ridiculously long name<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0his0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0his0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0his0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "Rap is a Man's Soul! Heads Up and Listen to the Man Who Seeks the Heavens, Kamina's Theme!" Told you so.</span>). It's also what the English parts of "Libera Me from Hell" are taken from.
</li><li> There's also "Gattai nante Kusokurae!!", the background music played in a lot of fights at the beginning of the series (you'll probably remember it by the line "Into the eye of the storm"). This song (and "Nikopol") is arranged by Taku Iwasaki and performed by qadtbep. It's sorta-kinda Kamina's theme.
<ul><li> "Gattai nante Kusokurae" is the track known in English as "To Hell With Gattai (aka "Combine")", as the name would imply it tends to play when Kamina &amp; Shimon aren't combined. And since Lagann exists only for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial">Fastball Special</a> when the two aren't combined...
</li><li> The English actually spoken in the series is another matter. Some of it is pretty good, such as "Infhinity Bigu Bangu Sthorm" (letters added because of the accent). On the other hand Gimmy and Darry horribly butcher any English they're given.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "Mr. Raindrop", the second ending theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, was sung completely in perfect English; the band attended a school taught primarily in both English and Chinese.
</li><li> Kate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sketchbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sketchbook">Sketchbook</a></em>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canadian</a>. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeAccentAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeAccentAbsence">her Japanese is heavily accented and far from perfect</a>. Not many characters pull this off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl">Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ3lW5fNhW0">NASA using some well pronounced English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in episode 1, which sounds like it was spoken by actual Americans. It's generally grammatically correct, unfortunately it doesn't sound like <em>anything</em> a real person would say and then it falls apart at the last second ("A CALL TO THE PRESIDENT!"). Also, it sounded like they just grabbed some random tourists off the street and paid them to read the lines because it's <em>really</em> badly acted.
<ul><li> While it doesn't sound like anything an English speaker would say, the words themselves are a practically perfect literal translation of the Japanese subtitles displayed, which themselves represent appropriate dialogue for those characters. This all goes to show you that there's more to translation than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationStyleChoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationStyleChoices">literally interpreting what was said.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ErgoProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ErgoProxy">Ergo Proxy</a></em>'s opening song, "Kiri", is a flawlessly-sung all-English song courtesy of Japanese rockers Monoral (Anis Shimada and Ali Morizumi). Considering that lead singer Shimada was born in London and is quadrilingual (apart from Japanese and English, he can also speak French and Arabic) and Morizumi is Japanese-American (though born and raised in Tokyo, he can speak both languages fluently himself), this is quite understandable.
</li><li> The ending theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em> is sung in English; although it has a rough Japanese accent, the grammar is actually fluent.
</li><li> Angela Burton from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> is an example of this trope: actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiKaida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiKaida">Yuki Kaida</a>'s English is clear and mostly properly inflected, if unnaturally slow and stilted (her biggest problem is only due to the accent common when trying to change from one language to another. It's not surprising that she likes to speak English in real life from time to time). And it's a good thing, because in the episode where she first appears, she has long stretches of <em>unsubtitled</em> lines. In contrast, Ohno (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AyakoKawasumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AyakoKawasumi">Ayako Kawasumi</a>) sounds like she has no idea what she's saying when she and Angela converse: despite the <em>grammatical</em> accuracy of her dialogue, her poor pronunciation renders many of her lines unintelligible. And this, when Ohno's supposed to have lived in America for ten years. Kasukabe's voice actress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatsukiYukino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatsukiYukino">Satsuki Yukino</a>, also speaks in a very good neutral English accent, probably the best international English of all the cast members. In all, though poorly pronounced, all the other character's English were easily intelligible (unless you just refuse to listen).
<ul><li> In <em>Second Season</em>, which has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">entirely new voice cast</a>, Ohno - now voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana">Yukana</a> - has much better English, as shown when Angela returns for an episode and the two have a conversation in a couple scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> "For the love of life", the first ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, is sung in perfect, completely understandable English. Of course, it's written and sung by David Sylvian, an Englishman, so, really, there was little else to expect. The second ending proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">mangle the words 'harmony' and 'purity' in the expected Japanese fashion</a>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em> had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> on vacation in Hawaii, and kidnapped by a gang of thugs who mistook Hikaru for a local shipping heiress. Madoka spoke passable English (appropriate for the high school student she was). The Hawaiian thugs all spoke English, oddly accented, but easily hand waved in that these were low-rent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> who spoke with a regional accent.
</li><li> Although only one word, hearing Chihara Minori say "unique" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> may arouse suspicions of fluency in the listener.
</li><li> "All kids hold an egg in their soul, the egg of our hearts, our would-be selves, yet unseen..." the quote that plays right before the opening of every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara!</a></em> may threw watchers for a loop the first time they hear it, to the point where they might mistake it for a dub. The sentence itself doesn't make sense, but it doesn't sound like a Japanese accent.
</li><li> The soundtrack to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em> has some songs by native speaker Paula Terry.
</li><li> The episode title cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em> have the titles read in surprisingly fluent English. (In fact, it only becomes apparent that it's <em>not</em> a native speaker in episode 5, in which "Positional" is pronounced "Pogitional".) "Last Exile" itself though, is not pronounced even remotely right most of the time, being rendered as "Rasuto Egisaiaru".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em>'s second ED that plays at the very last episode, "Walking in this Empty Earth" features English lyrics and while they are heavily accented the grammar is correct and understandable. There is also the short intro spoken in the mostly instrumental OP, it may only amount to one sentence but it is uttered without an accent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo">ef: A Tale Of Memories</a></em> uses English for its theme song lyrics, some parts of the novel written by Chihiro and in the post-episode trailer, which aside from some pronunciation-issues is well-executed.
<ul><li> Same deal with <em>ef: A Tale of Melodies</em> except all the text in the background is in German.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion">Genesis of Aquarion</a></em>'s opening theme has been performed by Akino and Bless4 (her siblings) in both Japanese and fluent English: they grew up in the US.
</li><li> Karen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller">Ichi the Killer</a></em>.
<ul><li> She goes one better and later speaks Surprisingly Good Cantonese as well. The actress portraying her speaks all three languages fluently.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em> has "To All the Dreamers", a disco-ish rap song, for the second ending theme. You can be caught off guard at how perfect the English parts of the song were when played in the credits.
<ul><li> Not only is the English pronounced well, but the rapper sings in Japanese with an American accent, too.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>'s first anime adaptation, Nodoka - played by Mamiko Noto - is able to read a long sentence in perfect English without a slip-up besides the word 'asked' (a-Su-ka-do). Ironically, Negi - played by Rina Satō - who was supposed to be <em>giving</em> the English lesson could barely speak a word of coherent English despite the surprised reaction from the class who apparently thought it sounded good. Interestingly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin">Latin</a> used in the series is spoken somewhat well.
</li><li> The first trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiddyGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiddyGrade">Kiddy Grade</a></em> was accompanied by the song "If I...", which was a mix of Japanese and Surprisingly Good English. To untrained ears, it might even sound like the <em>Japanese</em> is English-accented, rather than the expected reverse.
</li><li> All the English spoken by the native English speakers in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast">Eden of the East</a></em>, as well as all the written signs and the OP (which is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Noel Gallagher</a>) is in perfect English, even getting the accents acceptably well down.
<ul><li> In addition, almost all portrayals of DC are entirely accurate, down to the interior of Dulles International Airport.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1z2t0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1z2t0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1z2t0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only exception is the cars and trucks that drive next to the White House, the roads in front of the White House have been closed since 1995 due to the Oklahoma City Bombing.</span>
</li><li> That doesn't stop a little bit of hilarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> from being snuck in there.
</li><li> This isn't really surprising given that all the native-speakers were, in fact, voiced by Americans. (And yeah, one should suppose Oasis can sing in perfect English).

<ul><li> And also plenty of subversions: <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto">OLL HEIL BULITANIA!</a></strong></em> (Just check the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> page for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>).

Additionally, each episode title is in English, with each next episode preview featuring a dramatic reading of the upcoming episode's title. Of course, the show is set in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what was New York City</span>, but that sort of thing doesn't tend to help in these situations.
</li><li> The opening and ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em>. Its justified in the opening because Steve Conte is originally from America.
<ul><li> The anime contains some pretty good Russian, too. Especially surprising is the voice announcement on the railway station. It's in perfect unaccented Russian.
</li></ul></li><li> And Steve Conte has collaborated with Yoko Kanno in other times, too. He sang various songs from the next anime series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd">Brain Powerd</a></em> (with the song "True Love"), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> (with various songs, such the male version of "Rain", "Call me call me", "Words That Couldn't Say", etc...), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> (the opening song "Stray", as mentioned before, and other songs, such as "Heaven's Not Enough" and "Could You Bite My Hand?") and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> (with "living inside the shell"). Outside the anime material, there are two more songs: "Nowhere and Everywhere" from Yoko's album <em>Song to fly</em>, and "THE GARDEN OF EVERYTHING ~Denki Rocket ni Kimi wo Tsurete~", with backing vocals from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto">Maaya Sakamoto</a> (who is herself reasonably proficient in English, though she's admitted she lacks confidence in her language skills).
<ul><li> <em>Second Gig</em> has Surprisingly Good <em>Russian</em> and English combined in the theme, "Rise". The singer, "Origa" is Russian. The theme was written by her friend, composer Kanno Yoko.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Sword of the Stranger</em>'s English dub has a lot of surprisingly good <em>Chinese</em> speakers. Only one character spoke hard-to-understand, heavily accented Chinese...the transplanted European.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.onepiece-movie.com/">teaser trailer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the tenth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> movie — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmStrongWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmStrongWorld">One Piece Film: Strong World</a></em> — is, for no apparent reason, narrated in surprisingly good English (except possibly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">the characters are supposed to be speaking English</a>), even though it's for the Japanese release and so is the rest of the text.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>: Don't. Touch. Me.
</li><li> A rather hilarious example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfBlackHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLegendOfBlackHeaven">The Legend of Black Heaven</a>:</em> the English was very good (and voiced by an actual American), but the voice did not match the character at all.
</li><li> The ending theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>, "I'm Alive", is in perfect English; not really that surprising, given that the singer, Bec "Becca" Hollcraft, is an American native.
</li><li> The opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaHyouryuuVifam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaHyouryuuVifam">Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam</a></em> is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwszwb3aIPg">written and performed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in almost flawless English.
</li><li> The beginning of the newest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a> opening is grammatically correct, though it is quite noticeably accented. The very first ending straddles the line between this and regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>.
<ul><li> The fourth Shippuden opening "Closer" includes perfect English ("And the closer you get to something, the tougher it is to see it, and I'll never take it for granted, let's go!"), because the song's performer (and writer and composer) Joe Inoue is a Japanese American born in Los Angeles.
</li><li> The ending Wind from the original series is also sung surprisingly well.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaphneInTheBrilliantBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaphneInTheBrilliantBlue">Daphne in the Brilliant Blue</a></em> There are a few lines by some people from Siberia City who speak English flawlessly, though it's highly possible that the people who did the English speaking spoke English as their native tongue. Also Rena speaks English as well. Assuming her VA speaks English, she did a damn good job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> has a few songs that have some good English in them, which shouldn't be horribly surprising considering Yuki Kajiura composed them—she's also the one who composed "Obsession" and other .hack//SIGN songs. "Tsubasa", an insert song is entirely in English, and although the singer has a recognizable accent, you can still understand what she's saying without subtitles. "You are my Love", is another insert song entirely in English and there's very little accent that's only noticeable with a few words (that don't have Rs or Ls). The insert song, "Ring your Song", is also all in English and is very easy to understand. The only word that the singer seemed to have minimal trouble with was "Ancient."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> has some really good English on the OST. "Psychedelic Souljam", "Soul-Eater (So Scandalous)", "Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Have a Nice Dream" and "STEP UP" all come to mind; all of them are rapped and the English is grammatically correct. "Black Star (Never Lose Myself)" has some good English, too, although the singer has an accent it's still easy to understand him. "Death the Kid (So Crazy)" also has nice English. The female vocals have an accent, but subtitles aren't needed at all. Surprisingly, the song "Butterfly in the Still" by the same composer, Taku Iwasaki, has just plain horrible English. Whole phrases are almost entirely incoherent; it's a shame since it's a beautiful song... just impossible to understand.
</li><li> The OST to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas">Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas</a></em> has flawless grammar and perfect pronunciations, even on difficult phrases like "Realm of Athena". It's startlingly good, to the point that it feels like a taunt to the English-speaking fandom that will never see an official release of the series in their language.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoTribe">Tokyo Tribe</a> 2</em> has a minor character in episode 6 who speaks English... to a Japanese guy. Later on, we have Surprisingly Good Mandarin with Sunmi and Jadakings. The latter's Mandarin is so good, it actually confuses Kai as to what he's saying (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Where is the princess?"</span>)
</li><li> The Japanese ending for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai">Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai</a> (known in Japan as "Pocket Monsters Diamond &amp; Pearl the Movie: Dialga VS Palkia VS Darkrai") was sung entirely in English, by two British singers. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEy17g3HprY">See for yourself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Also, a number of Pokémon related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Songs</a> were done by a trio known as "Suzukisan". The songs often featured a large amount of Surprisingly Good English, mostly due to one of the members being an American. (Said American also provided the voice of the pirate trainer at the start of the Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> Chiyo-Dad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> speaks grammatically correct English, courtesy of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto">Norio Wakamoto</a>. The intonation is actually perfect ("How ah YOU?" "FINE, SANK you"), even pronouncing Ls and Vs correctly, sounds which don't exist in Japanese. He doesn't get the "th" right, but very few foreigners do.
<ul><li> In an earlier episode, Yukari gives a speech in perfect English, though slightly accented. She was giving a speech about how Japanese English students are embarrassed about their poor English and would rather speak Japanese than bad English.
</li></ul></li><li> It's amazing how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a> OVA VI</em> ending theme "Magnolia" was sung in remarkable English, as was Schaft when they sang the ironically titled trailer song "Broken English". And the end credits sequence had actual English spoken in the talk balloons.
</li><li> Eyecatches in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em> have series title said by someone who gets his pronouncing done perfectly. Not the faintest sign of r's.
<ul><li> It's made even more obvious because of the difficult nature of the two main characters' names to Japanese speakers. Remember the issues they have with definitive L and R sounds, then look at EDWARD and ALPHONSE ELRIC. Bonus points to the fact that each name gets 2-3 extra syllables thanks to pronunciations. Aside from the names, there's only the barest smattering of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> in the series itself.
</li><li> A note left by Dr Marcoh in the original series is written in fragmented but accurate English. Given that Marcoh is trying to reveal as little information as possible for fear of it being leaked, this actually makes sense.
</li><li> The certificate that the Military gives Ed (the one with his new title of "Fullmetal Alchemist") is written in good English. It's in plain spoken English, something the real military would never write in, but it's far from Engrish.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen">Weather Observation Plane Easterly, calling Enola Gay. Calling Enola Gay. Weather's fair and clear over Hiroshima. Conditions favorable for bombing.</a>"
</li><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> was written in perfect English because, according to Ryuk, it's the most common international language of humans. It <em>is</em> the international language of business, after all. Light can read it because, as we see in the beginning, he's one of the best English students in the country, even understanding qualifiers like "as" (which lots of Japanese have trouble with), "therefore" and "whosoever". There are a couple spelling mistakes (like "looses" instead of "loses"), which is understandable, as the misspellings are all words that some native speakers have trouble with. There's also one or two misplaced commas (again, something natives have trouble with). But overall, it looks like it was written by a native English speaker very familiar with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing">legalese<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Obata must have learned by reading all those ToAs in English software.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Rainbow">Rainbow</a></em> pulls the English off <em>very</em> brilliantly. Not only do all the American soldiers speak <em>real</em> English (it's highly likely that their VA's are actually American since they have the accent to boot.), the <em>Japanese</em> talking English have the regular 'Engrish' you have in other anime. This makes the situations where Japanese (with their natural accent) talks with an American (who talks real English) completely realistic. <em>Respect</em> for pulling that off.
<ul><li> On top of this, the opening song, "We're not alone" by Japanese band Coldrain, is written and sung in excellent English that also fits the plot really well. It helps that the lead singer, Masato, is American.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the songs from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> soundtrack have perfect English. Honorable mentions go to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingTheme">Ending Theme</a> "Fallen Angel", "D City Rock", "Champion", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong">CHOCOLAT</a>".
</li><li> Invoked in the cold opening of the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantKilling">Giant Killing</a></em>, with the random Englishman's properly... English (as in British!) sounding voice, and with the Japanese observers' properly but not unintelligibly accented English. Sadly, the trope is subverted not more than a few seconds later in the opening theme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a> 2: Innocence</em> features two songs in English with sensible lyrics, sung with only a slight accent by jazz singer Kimiko Ito. The ending song, "Follow Me", is in fact an arrangement of a song originally written in English, but the earlier one, "River of Crystals", was written for the movie by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiKawai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiKawai">Kenji Kawai</a>.
</li><li> The English spoken by the British soldiers in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MomotarosDivineSeaWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MomotarosDivineSeaWarriors">Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors</a></em> sounds pretty authentic. Now, considering that Japan was a fascist nation at the time which didn't like foreigners very much, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">who voiced the British soldiers?</a>
<ul><li> Propaganda film means they probably had access to native English speakers (Nisei) who had been attending school in Japan when the war broke out. The intelligence services grabbed most of them (willing or not).
</li></ul></li><li> A fun example from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukebanDeka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukebanDeka">Sukeban Deka</a></em> OVA. One of the Mizuki sisters makes a drug deal with an American dealer. The supposed American speaks terrible Engrish, but the girl's English is flawless.
</li><li> The opening of the first OVA episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas">Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas</a></em> may count. It is entirely in English, and makes complete sense.
</li><li> In a rather hilarious example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, the character who is suppose to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">the personification</a> of The United States of America <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcicxfC-LeY">cannot speak English to save his life.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And yet... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">his pet alien seems to manage it just fine.</a>
<ul><li> Creator Hidekaz Himaruya's English is very good. It's justified, since he spent about six years in New York.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9fhQVMzlC0">The debut trailer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/REDLINE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/REDLINE">REDLINE</a></em> opens with a bit of fairly decent English, spoken by Australian-Japanese actor Mark Okita (also the voice of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a>). Most of the vocal songs are in English and sung by native speakers, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqrCcfcIIPY">such as the theme song "Redline Day"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> is set in a futuristic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCommunitiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCommunitiesWereHarmed">No Communities Were Harmed</a> version of New York, and so the English text seen is clear and accurate, everything from ticker tape news on TV screens to articles on newspapers. Episode 1 even features a detailed notice of foreclosure written in perfect English with Japanese subtitles on screen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">(ignoring the question of why something this detailed is posted across two screen doors rather than, say, as a letter)</a>. While the main character apparently can't read the English titles of the episodes, this seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningJoke">Running Joke</a> rather than an in-universe fact.
<ul><li> The show's (second) closing credits include whole screens of English-language translations of the featured characters' lines from previous episodes.
</li><li> The voice for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">Good Luck Mode</a> also has pretty clear English. And sounds remarkably like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">the Decadriver...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the Great Saiyaman arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a> Z</em>, Son Gohan has an English teacher who, despite having a slight accent, speaks very good English. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in when you note that everyone on Earth (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">and even aliens in most cases</a>) in Dragon Ball appear to speak the same language...
</li><li> There's an infamous Engrish scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss">Itazura Na Kiss</a></em>, but as bad as the pronunciation is, the grammar and syntax are perfect.
</li><li> The opening song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> is performed entirely in English by fade, a Japanese band that has four members raised in America. Three of the members are Japanese-Americans, and lead singer Jonathan Underwood was born and raised in Seattle.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SacredSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SacredSeven">Sacred Seven</a></em> features an auctioneer voiced by a British expat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> had an episode where the characters went to a party at the British embassy, and the main characters spoke the language at various degrees of ability: Usagi and Makoto were <em>terrible</em> (apparently Makoto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">thinks 'thank you' is a form of salute</a>); Rei and Mamoru can speak it decently, if accented; Ami and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Minako</a> were speaking almost perfect Queen's English. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in Minako's case, as the anime version had her fighting youma in London for a period and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">she's hinted to have lived abroad for years</a> (in fact Minako herself states she had already known one of her friends in London <em>before</em> the anime stint).
</li><li> When Senjougahara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a></em> says "Parent Teacher Association", this trope is clearly evident.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>: While none of the main cast <em>speaks</em> English onscreen, it's made fairly obvious that English is the default language of the show. In both the original series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Macross: Do You Remember Love?</a></em>, there are shots of English writing (in the series, Minmay displays a letter from an agency offering her an audition, while in the movie, we get a close-up of Misa's handwritten lyrics to the title song) that show that either someone on staff was fluent in English or knew someone who was. Additionally, <em>Do You Remember Love?</em>'s background dialogue includes a fair amount of pretty good English, which is particularly noticeable with the <em>Macross</em>'s intercom system.
<ul><li> There was also a bit of the series's theme that was rather decent English. "Will you love me tomorrow?", for example.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> counts. The anime doesn't do as well, but it shines when Rock translates for Balalaika during the meeting with the Yakuza, and when Revy is talking to Ginji in the same arc.
<ul><li> Amusingly, flipped <em>while</em> played straight in the dub; Brad Swaile is proficient enough in Japanese to do <em>actual</em> translation work on the side.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveLucky">Love Lucky</a></em>: When Fuuta and Kirari travelled to Hawaii, they met a foreigner asking for directions in English. To the readers (and Kirari's) surprise, Fuuta spoke English. He then explained to Kirari a former girlfriend of his tricked him into buying tapes made to teach people English and he decided not to waste the money.
<ul><li> It's made even more surprising when, up to that point, one would expect Kirari to be better than him at English.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic">Kiniro Mosaic</a></em> obviously had someone on staff who knows their English. Two of the main characters are British girls who occasionally speak their native English, and the first episode is set mostly in England. The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3QpCdyIw4">pronunciation of some of the words<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is off, but the grammar is near perfect.
</li><li> Isao Sasaki once sang an English version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> theme song in natural sounding English, if a bit accented. Ichiro Mizuki's English version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">on the other hand...</a>.
</li><li> "Somewhere", the last ending theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers Try</a></em>, is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYrBF9CmI-k">sung by Houko Kuwashima<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Kuwashima demonstrates surprisingly good English for the vocals. (It is also of interesting note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MegumiHayashibara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MegumiHayashibara">Megumi Hayashibara</a> does not sing this song, making it the only <em>Slayers</em> theme song she doesn't sing.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SquidGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SquidGirl">Squid Girl</a></em> had an episode where Cindy (an American) was teaching the main characters how to speak English, where she <em>actually speaks fluent English</em> even if her line reading was a little flat, although it's not the usual actress for that line.
</li><li> "Before My Body is Dry" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> sort of skirts the line between this and plain ol' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>. On one hand, Mika Kobayashi pronounces the lyrics fairly well. On the other hand, the lyrics <em>themselves</em> are a tad broken. There are good bits, such as the lines "you're the only one who can help me out/we'll be as one", and "I gotta find out who killed my dad", both of which make perfect sense, but then there are lines like "may you surprised so much" and "this is the way to be more strong", which don't really add up. There is, however, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears">rap part</a> in the middle of the song done in perfect English both pronunciation and grammar-wise; it's just not very good.
<ul><li> Also Mako's theme, "Light Your Heart Up", which is sung in perfect English by Aimee B.
</li></ul></li><li> American Alexandra Garcia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XTv3N1M4F8">speaks English with decent pronunciation and fairly natural inflection.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiKaida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiKaida">Yuki Kaida</a>'s attempt at an American accent isn't bad either.
<ul><li> From the same show, there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtPDiYHUWuQ">Tatsuya's introduction scene.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> While the pronunciation is so-so, the dialogue is actually pretty fluent. The video also showcases some of Taiga's American friends who speak perfect English... but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">ridiculously hokey acting</a>. They are also apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedAccent">Australian immigrants to America</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Gun Gale Online</em> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, there's a mini-game called "Untouchable" where a cowboy NPC tries to shoot you, and taunts you at the same time. It's perfectly obvious that they got an actual American to voice him in the anime. His lines are still the <em>tiniest</em> bit stilted (which sometimes happens when English actors are directed by people who don't speak the language), but he's just a program, so it's justified.
<ul><li> "Crossing Field", the season 1 opening of the anime, also has an English version performed by the original singer. It's both gramatically correct and fluently performed, the accent notwithstanding.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is set in Australia, and actual Australian voice actors perform minor and bit parts. Additionally, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruMiyano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruMiyano">Mamoru Miyano</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">struggling with the pronunciation</a>, Rin's lines are grammatically impeccable.</span>
</li><li> The source of the current trope image, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> has some very well written English, to the point where ironically the only error in an English newspaper article in episode 2 was misspelling a <em>Japanese</em> word. (Specifically, misspelling "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a>" as "Heitai".)
<ul><li> In a later episode, some of the Japanese characters speak English to some American one-shot characters. Every sentence is correct, and spoken with a surprisingly decent accent.
</li></ul></li><li> In Operation 04 of the OVA of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SentouYouseiYukikaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SentouYouseiYukikaze">Sentou Yousei Yukikaze</a></em>, a pair of Japanese Navy F/27s that intercept Yukikaze <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXadee4y5PQ&amp;t=1m0s">speak English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when they demand Rei and Jack disarm and follow them. Though their pronunciation of "disarm" leaves much to be desired, the sentence "You have been intercepted" is quite clear and easily understood. About a minute later, after the Japanese fleet commander orders his ships to shoot down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InscrutableAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InscrutableAliens">JAM fighters</a> closing in on them, the fire control officer says "All stations, launch SAMs" in English.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaNoPrinceSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaNoPrinceSama">Uta No Prince Sama</a>", Starish speaks English quite well in their opening theme, "Maji Love 1000%," with the expection of them saying, "Let's song!" in the beginning. They do say the grammatically correct, "Let's dance!" later, though.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6vCdFriZbY">The opening scene in the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri">Yuru-Yuri</a> Nachuyasumi</em> OVA. Despite the fact that it has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">no reason</a></em> to be in English, and the horrible pronunciation, the dialogue itself is grammatically sound. Though the phrase "never mind" seems to be used differently than an English-speaker would use it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Several songs in the soundtrack have perfect English grammar, such as <em>Calling Your Name.</em> Special mention goes to <em>DOA</em>, which not only has grammatically perfect lyrics about what it's like to be a member of the Survey Corps, but is also <em>pronounced</em> perfectly as well. This one is because the song is performed by Aimee Blackschleger, an American singer living in Japan who has also contributed music to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown">Guilty Crown</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>: Most of the character's powers are in English. Pitch perfect English.
<ul><li> It also helps that at least the main hero's seiyuu is confirmed to be able to speak <em>5 languages</em>, one of which is English itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbCA1rhlJcQ">This bit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TerrorInResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TerrorInResonance">Terror in Resonance</a></em> has Five's FBI handler Clarence talking to his superiors on the phone in flawless English, and though his actor is Japanese he's apparently fluent. Five speaks pretty well herself albeit with a bit of an accent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but this is justified as she was a Japanese orphan originally</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> has three opening themes in unaccented, perfectly structured English. The fourth opening theme is also in English, though with a noticeably thicker accent.
</li><li> In the anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KiniroNoCorda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KiniroNoCorda">Kin'iro no Corda</a></em>, the opening song, performed by Kanon, breaks into perfect English at certain points. It isn't quite that surprising, given how she spent most of her childhood abroad.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> has a rather surprising example, as the character songs for the series contain a near perfect rendition of Love Me Tender, performed by none other than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiyukiMorikawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiyukiMorikawa">Toshiyuki Morikawa</a></em>. It's quite uncanny when you hear it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient">Panzer World Galient</a></em>'s opening theme has several lines of English (in fact, the original singer, EUROX, also recorded a 100% English version), and its ending theme is almost entirely in English. Not only is the pronunciation is pretty good (though a Japanese accent is still occasionally noticeable), but the grammar is <em>perfect</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em> has several instances of this, since it has a multicultural cast and it's often implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">most of them speak to each other in English</a>.
<ul><li> The lyrics of the opening theme, "History Maker", are entirely in English and are for the most part grammatically correct and well-pronounced.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">If you pause at the right moments</a>, the skaters' comments on their Instagram photos during the ending credits are all written in decent English.
</li><li> In Episode 4, Yuko's text to Yurio is written in English, and it seems she's quite fluent in the language.
</li><li> Jean-Jacques Leroy's short program theme music, "Theme of King J.J.", has lyrics that make sense (save a few) and are well-pronounced, as expected of a theme song about a Canadian character. It's sung by Swedish singer Linus Norda rather than J.J.'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruMiyano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruMiyano">voice actor</a>.
</li><li> Yuri's slurred "Be my coach, Victor!" in episode 10 is surprisingly understandable, especially for a character who is, at the time, incredibly drunk.
</li><li> Though the title is definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>, the lyrics for Georgi's free program song "A Tales of Sleeping Prince" still fall into this trope thanks to being sung by Japanese-American R&amp;B singer AISHA.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 9th episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard">Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card</a></em> anime, Syaoran <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Lm3e4LOFA">manages to speak decent English with only a slight accent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to an English-speaking couple, much to Sakura's surprise. The Funimation dub changes it to French.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012">Overlord (2012)</a></em>: The names of the spells used are all in English (the series takes a lot of inspiration from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>), and are generally correct barring a few exceptions like Zenberu's [Resistance Massive]. In the anime, however, it's jarring to hear heavily-accented English in the middle of a Japanese dialogue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkullFaceBooksellerHondaSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkullFaceBooksellerHondaSan">Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san</a></em>, Honda meets an attractive older gentleman who apparently can only speak English. The anime adaptation has him speaking quite clearly. Subverted by Honda himself, though, who tells the audience in very clear terms that he can't speak English well.
</li><li> Episode 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> introduces Mary Mcguire, a pianist who speaks perfect English. Ryou and Keiichirô also speak to her English, but with accents. Unusual for an anime is that all three have full conversations in English that detail information about the plot
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: The song "Hero Too", performed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> by the students of Class 1-A, in English.

Because her family was slaughtered in part due to their inability to understand English, it makes sense that she would have made an effort to correct that lack.
</li><li> A wide range of German and French characters are revealed to be perfectly fluent in English. Bridget von Hammersmark (played by the German-born Diane Kruger, who had to exaggerate her accent when speaking English) lampshades it when she asks with exasperation if the American soldiers speak <em>any</em> other language than English, implying that being multi-lingual is simply standard for Europeans.

His father converses with them in Japanese, which angers him (given that Japan has previously occupied Indonesia during WW2, this isn't too surprising, plus there's his belief that their family should be dominant in Jakarta), meaning there's an actual character-based reason for him to speak in another language.
</li><li> Almost every character in the 2014 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> speaks surprisingly good English, to the point where there's probably just as much spoken English as there is Japanese.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum">Night at the Museum</a></em>, the Egyptian mummy of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah speaks English with a refined British accent. When asked about it, he explains that he's been an exhibit at Oxford for a while, where he, presumably, picked up the language and the accent.
</li><li> In the musical version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowerDrumSong">Flower Drum Song</a></em> Mei Li and her father are poor Chinese immigrants who speak perfect English. This is a slight adaptation change from the book where they were already living in America for a while when they're introduced - whereas the musical begins with them arriving. Master Wang too has very good English, which was the case in the book too - where he knew English but refused to say anything beyond 'yes' or 'no'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldOfSuzieWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldOfSuzieWong">The World of Suzie Wong</a></em> - Suzie and her friends speak in some broken English but have no problem understanding it, and Gwennie Lee is able to read English perfectly. As the majority of their clients are British and American, one could assume they picked it up over time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VickyCristinaBarcelona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VickyCristinaBarcelona">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a></em>'s Maria Elena has to be ordered to speak in English whenever Cristina is around - and it's clear Spanish is what she prefers. But she speaks English just as well as Spanish.

Although she appears to be a Chinese native, her actress Anna May Wong was third-generation Chinese from San Francisco.

He is more or less fluent, though he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">Third-Person Person</a> and uses other Native American flourishes in his word choices.
</li><li> We are first introduced to Hana-ogi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sayonara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sayonara">Sayonara</a></em> when Gruver constantly sees her from afar, and doesn't actually come face to face with her until over an hour into the film. He spends the evening talking to her, unsure if she can understand anything she says - as the other Japanese character in the film Katsumi has limited English and mostly speaks Japanese with her husband. Then Hana-ogi reveals she can speak perfect English and was remaining silent because she wasn't sure what kind of person Gruver was.
</li><li> Okoye of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther (2018)</a></em> speaks mostly in Wakandan when outside the city, as it's handy for espionage. Everett Ross asks T'Challa if she speaks English, and Okoye deadpans "when she <em>wants</em> to."

<ul><li> Eve speaks perfect German, French, and English. Since she rarely has occasion to use more than one or two of these with someone, people are often surprised by her skills. For example, she helps Charlie with a clerk who can't understand Charlie's American-accented French and Charlie remarks that she didn't know Eve could speak French so well.
</li><li> Captain Cameron asked Eve to translate a letter into French, but later switched to French when speaking with her. It's implied that he asked her to translate the letter to test her language skills, not because he needed the help.

He explains that if his handle on the language isn't perfect, he would just be seen as another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a> in England, and he is too proud to let that happen. It's also implied that he didn't want to stand out, for obvious reasons.
</li><li> A classic example occurs in John Steinbeck's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EastOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EastOfEden">East of Eden</a></em>. Adam Trask's cook Lee speaks perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a> when he's first hired, but that soon is revealed to be a ruse; Lee speaks perfectly good English, but he found it ran so counter to people's preconceptions that the only way he could be accepted in American society was to conform to the stereotype.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess">Murderess</a></em>, this applies to James, the boy from Chopped Tree Inn, and to the Dark Ones king, who is particularly eloquent.

British minister Cornelius Fudge, not the brightest man even in the best circumstances, bends over backwards to try and convey himself to his colleague. Only after losing the match, the disappointed Bulgarian strikes up a conversation in decent English (with a pretty thick Bulgarian accent, though still grammatically correct) with the shocked Fudge.

He also swears in English when angered. This is due to actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMusashi">Mark Musashi</a>, while born in Japan, is half-American and grew up in Maine before returning to Japan to act.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood">Deadwood</a></em>, Mr. Lee, the new Chinese arrival from San Francisco and rival to Wu, speaks perfect English. After years of trying to overcome Wu's single-digit vocabulary, Al Swearengen is visibly shocked when Lee reveals this.
</li><li> The opening narration of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Garo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Garo">GARO</a></em> is spoken entirely in grammatically correct English. <em>Garo</em> also features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMusashi">Mark Musashi</a> as the mute Kodama until an appearance in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> DVD-only episode <em>Garo Gaiden: Smile</em>, where he literally appears out of nowhere and verbally assaults the female lead with a whole string of Surprisingly Good English, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a> thrown in.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> has more than one example:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFaiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFaiz">Kamen Rider Faiz</a></em> (aka <em>Kamen Rider 555</em>) from 2003 has, in early episodes, a rather creepy commercial that's in very good English (it doesn't make perfect sense, but it's not supposed to: Faiz has a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> to it.) At the end of each episode, the ominous voice from the commercial introduces the preview of the next episode with "Open your eyes for the next Faiz" (and for the finale, "Open your eyes for the last Faiz.") The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">transforming belts</a> have computer voices that also speak decent English (however, the phrases are one or two words only, and the only time you get awkward English in Faiz is when a computer phrase gets longer: When summoning the Jet Sliger rocket-bikes, the computer says "Jet Sliger, come closer.")
</li><li> Leo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a>, is apparently an American, and speaks perfect English. He was not introduced as such, and didn't speak until his second scene, so it was very jarring. Leo's actor, Peter Ho, is Chinese-American and speaks Chinese, Japanese, and English. Supposedly, the filmmakers found his Japanese bad, so they had him say the lines in English instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade">Kamen Rider Blade</a></em> is an exception, since, unlike <em>555</em> and <em>Kabuto</em>, its computers speak horribly accented English which is a shame, since they have an awful lot of lines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kamen Rider Kabuto</a></em> from 2006 has its computers speaking very good English. Typically, the Rider will call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">"Raidaa Kikku!"</a> and the computer will repeat "Rider Kick" flawlessly. Also, in a few post-credit scenes (not part of the series continuity), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Tendou Souji</a> reveals that he can speak English with almost no accent if he puts his mind to it.
<ul><li> His actor, Hiro Mizushima, was raised in Europe at a young age and can speak perfect English. It's quite jarring when, in one of the post-credit bonus scenes, one character talks about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderStronger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderStronger">Kamen Rider "Stron-gaa"</a> and moments later Tendo refers to him as "Stron-ger", the correct English pronunciation of the name, and even puns off of his name by saying Kabuto is "strongest". Mizushima gets to show off his talent more in some of the Super Hero Time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> bumpers, affecting a falsetto voice to "impersonate" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoGoSentaiBoukenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoGoSentaiBoukenger">Zuban</a> and mess with Kagami's head. "No, no, repeat after me!"
</li><li> In the Non-Canon Movie, The computer on the ZECT Space Station speaks in Perfect English, however Kagami (who gave the orders to the computer) speaks in heavily accented Gratuitous English.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em> doesn't seem to know what to do with this trope sometimes. The voice for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">tools for both Decade and Diend</a> calls out various rider names and attacks in seemingly random accents. For riders with English words for names, they're called out in clear English accents. Some attacks with English names are called out in gratuitous English accents. Others still are actual Japanese words or phrases that are spoken as though it's new to the language.
</li><li> There is a Blink and You'll Miss It moment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a>: A to Z - The Gaia Memories of Fate</em>. In the opening the helicopter pilot has 2 lines, both in perfect English (the actor being a Westerner): "What the..." and "Kamen Rider". Also, Aya Kujo in "The T That Came Back" pronounced English fairly well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the fact that she had spent several months in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO">Kamen Rider OOO</a> has its own brief moment in an early episode when Chiyoko, thinking Ankh's rather coarse Japanese is because he was raised overseas, determines to correct it and starts the lesson with a perfect 'Repeat after me.' Given the character is an international traveler its not too odd but its still sufficiently polished to cause a double take.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TomicaHeroRescueForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TomicaHeroRescueForce">Tomica Hero Rescue Force</a></em>, the Supreme Commander, Natsuno "Nancy" Nanbu/Rescue Universe, unconsciously speaks coherent English while in the heat of battle. Her underlings (most of which can't understand English) ask her to speak Japanese in very broken Gratuitous English.
<div class="indent">"Please... Talk... me... Japanese. JAPANESE!!"

<div class="indent"><strong>Tourist:</strong> Excuse me. Can you help me find this place? <br/><strong>Tsubasa:</strong> Ai. Kanto. Supiiku.

Go straight, and turn left. At the end of this road, then you'll see it.

It should be noted that the voice in the song says "JAKQ" as "Jacker", adding to the effect.
</li><li> Masato Shimon's rendition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeijuuSentaiGingaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeijuuSentaiGingaman">Seijuu Sentai Gingaman</a></em>'s opening theme in English is very well pronounced due to his fluency in English, however the translation is not that good, which is naturally not his fault.

This carries over into the toys as well - in particular, the countdown used by Gigant Houou sounds like a native English speaker, even though it's the same voice actor as all of the other spoken sounds used in the series and toys.

The dub's intent was to teach proper English to Japanese children, and did so by keeping several parts of dialogue un-dubbed, producing this effect.
</li><li> A common occurrence in Scandi crime dramas, which can throw English watchers of them, are characters breaking into English, sometimes with very English accents.
<ul><li> Brigitte Nyborg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Borgen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Borgen">Borgen</a></em> is a case in point; when she speaks English (i.e. to a foreign leader) she almost sounds Australian.

<ul><li> Israeli singers <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_zFJEG7lGU">Geva Alon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naHbB15Eav8">Ehud Banai<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> both have songs written completely in perfect English, even though Geva's song is just a remake of an old song.
<ul><li> Israeli singing competitions nowadays usually feature a <em>lot</em> of English-language songs, although some try to tone it down and promote (or outright require) singing in Hebrew. The quality of the accent ranges significantly, with examples of this popping up frequently.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan">X Japan</a> vocalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToshimitsuDeyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToshimitsuDeyama">Toshi</a> and bandleader/drummer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi">Yoshiki</a> have VERY good English. For Yoshiki, it's a result of his having lived in the US since the early 1990s and have studied the language since long before then. He writes songs such as Art of Life with quite coherent English lyrics, blogged only in English, regularly speaks in English, and otherwise is stunningly good with it for a non-native speaker. Toshi can sing in quite coherent English and could as far back as 1989 with the song "Desperate Angel".
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HidetoMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HidetoMatsumoto">hide</a> also demonstrated the ability to sing in English with his band Zilch and as seen on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7-rEtdRG54">What's Up Mr. Jones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> only had a slight accent; otherwise, the pronunciations is near-perfect. Hide's solo song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIchkoHZ-7I">"Lemoned I Scream"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is, however, incoherent even by Japanese standards
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, visual key artist Gasket is a fairly fluent, though accented, speaker of (mostly American) English. He's made the comment that a good part of his book collection is in English, since that's the language a lot of the more interesting things are published first. He also speaks a fair amount of Mandarin Chinese. His French, on the other hand, is nigh-indecipherable...
</li><li> Ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Galneryus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Galneryus">Galneryus</a> vocalist Yuma-B not only sings in perfect (albeit heavily accented) English, but posts in it on his site BBS.
</li><li> Several songs by Itou Kinaki are sung in Japanese mixed with some English, but she always sings it without an accent. In an OST for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BLGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BLGame">BL Game</a> Lamento-BEYOND THE VOID by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NitroplusCHIRAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NitroplusCHIRAL">Nitroplus CHIRAL</a>, she sang a song with Watanabe Kazuhiro, both voices singing entirely accent-less English. Even Watanabe's voice sounded like someone singing a song out of Lion King (in the sense that his accents are so English-like, rather than Japanese-like). They also each sing one completely-English song well in the Original Image Soundtrack of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>.
</li><li> The song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVetY60i0Xc">"Candy Pop" by the Heartsdales<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, made famous outside of Japan through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanVid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanVid">Fan Vid</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIjsPFYdkZY">"Skittles"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Much like the above, this is quite understandable, as the group consists of two sisters who were born in Japan but raised in the US.
</li><li> In the Complete Symphonic recording of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> (a must-have for the die-hard fans of the musical), the role of Eponine is played by Japanese-cast-member Kaho Shimada. She sings in English with hardly any accent, despite not knowing any English at the time of recording.
</li><li> Listen to Space Sonic by Ellegarden. Sounds like a typical rock band from USA? But the band is entirely Japanese. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Having a vocalist that worked for nearly a decade in California sure helps.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LArcEnCiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LArcEnCiel">L'arc-en-Ciel</a> sings in both Japanese and English. Their opening track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> (as well as the ending song for the movie, <em>Conquerors of Shamballa</em>) switches between the two, but the ending song they did for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a></em> was fully in English, and while not absolutely perfect, is very easily understandable. Their lead singer, Hyde, actually pays an American woman to proof-read his lyrics and provide him with a pronunciation guide.
</li><li> Rie Fu. It helps that she spent three years in Maryland, and went to school in the UK. She basically has an American accent with her English, which is also grammatically correct.
</li><li> Singers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru">Utada Hikaru</a> and Crystal Kay threw many people for a loop upon exhibiting flawless English. Utada was raised in America, but the fact that Crystal Kay sounds like an American R&amp;B singer despite being born and raised in Japan is still considered astounding (her father is African-American, however, so it is justified in a way).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto">Maaya Sakamoto</a> has some songs with nice English. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em>'s "gravity" comes to mind. A song on her latest album Kazeyomi has "colors", which is entirely in pretty well spoken English. "THE GARDEN OF EVERYTHING" which she sang as a duet with Steve Conte (mentioned above) has flawless English vocals, both in her backups and solos. Funny enough, a comment from the Nikopachi Singles compilation album the song is featured on has a comment from Maaya saying, "Steve emails me all the time, but I can never respond back because I don't understand English!". And then there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrR_bQMPYpc">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXeetZ0hTY">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoAKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoAKorea">BoA</a> (aka Boa Kwan) has some nice English. Born in Korea, she knows Korean, Japanese, some English, and has sung one or two songs in Mandarin. She has full songs in English, including a translated version of "Every Heart", "Amazing Kiss" and other pop songs she's done—she also has "The Christmas Song" and "Last Christmas" on two of her holiday singles. Her English is accented a little, but she's improved a lot over the years.
<ul><li> She recently had an American debut album and her English sounded pretty good. There were even some songs where it was hard to tell that she had an accent.
</li></ul></li><li> Yuna Ito has flawless English. This isn't surprising considering she was born and raised in the United States. Her English songs are amazing—she's done "My Heart Will Go On" originally by Celine Dion" and "All I Want for Christmas is You" by Mariah Carey.
</li><li> Jyongri has perfect English. She's of Korean descent, but was born and raised in Japan, and speaks both Japanese and English fluently—she did attend an international school, though. Her song "Winter Love Story" is about half English and half Japanese.
</li><li> The Korean band Clazziquai has vocalists who can sing and rap in solid English, resulting in a good number of English-language songs.
</li><li> Japanese band Godiego (pronounced Go-dye-go) has songs that are partially in English or entirely in English, not surprising as two of the five members are American, although their main vocalist and lyricist are wholly Japanese (their lyricist did however spend her childhood in Montreal and after that lived in New York). Their songs include <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw-NqopctV8">"The Galaxy Express 999" and "Monkey Magic"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the theme songs for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em> movie and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monkey">Monkey</a></em>, as well the soundtrack for the cult surrealist horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hausu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hausu">Hausu</a></em>. The soundtrack they performed for <em>Monkey</em> titled <em>Magic Monkey</em> consisted of 11 entirely English tracks and was the Number 1 Record in Japan for 1979. They also have the distinction of being the first rock band to play in China and Nepal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Loudness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Loudness">Loudness</a>, being a band that takes heavy inspiration from American hair metal and The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveOfBritishHeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveOfBritishHeavyMetal">New Wave of British Heavy Metal</a>, more or less required this. They also took this trope to its logical conclusion when they had a need to replace their vocalist by hiring an American instead of another Japanese singer. But when they rehired a Japanese singer, they chose Masaki Yamada, who became an American citizen in the 1990s and speaks English with virtually no accent.
</li><li> Italian comedian Adriano Celentano released a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAnYBCImAa4">particularly catchy single<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sung in "surprisingly good English-sounding gibberish" which supposedly sounds very authentic to people who don't actually speak English. In fact, it's pure gibberish in any language.
</li><li> Hyadain's take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Terra's Theme</a>, which is entirely in English, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSNJ9KcOnF8">must be heard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Los Angeles native <a class="urllink" href="http://www.inouejoe.com">Joe Inoue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is essentially a polyglot. His debut EP in Japan featured songs entirely in English and entirely in Japanese, while his first studio album was all in Japanese with his native English peppered in, like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cp0WgkgDbQ">"CLOSER"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was the theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippuden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippuden">Naruto Shippuden</a></em>. His subsequent project is TENGUBOY where he <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb2s6sHSK08">raps in Japanese AND English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and he has also taken on Portuguese in his vlogs as he tours Brazil.
</li><li> Miyavi of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> band Dué le Quartz spent six months studying English in California. Consequently, he speaks pretty good, coherent English and blogs in both Japanese and English; granted, the latter is mainly text speak, but this just seems to be his idiolect, since he renders "with" as "wiz".
<ul><li> It's Miyavi-ish, more or less. His Japanese is the same way, when he's not making a particular effort to be more formal. The English in his song lyrics is pretty coherent, insofar as any of his lyrics are coherent in any language, and in one song he even managed to not mangle some Spanish. He's also no longer with Dué le Quartz — he's gone solo and started his own label.
</li><li> Being married to a Hawaiian probably doesn't hurt either.
</li></ul></li><li> Lotus Juice may be part of the Pantheon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish">Surprisingly Good English</a>. In all fairness, he did spend a good chunk of his childhood going to school in the United States.
</li><li> There's a group of German musicians who call themselves Fiddler's Green. They perform Irish folk, both old and new standards and their own work, in English that makes you go "What's wrong with his accent?" instead of "Dear Gods that's a German trying to sound Irish." It's not surprisingly good, it's surprisingly amazing. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sm2NdkXx5k&amp;feature=related">The Night Pat Murphy Died<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, admittedly a song from Newfoundland, and it STILL sounds like a weird Irish accent.
</li><li> Bonnie Pink is also quite good, if <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCsNVud0tUM">Ring a Bell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is anything to go by.
<ul><li> She covered <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZb4raA1ue8">"Your Eyes"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Tatsuro Yamashita, who is another example of this trope, having released multiple songs like this one in perfect English, and inserting completely correct English into otherwise Japanese songs.
</li></ul></li><li> Both Koshi Inaba and Tak Matsumoto AKA B'z is fluent in English. Considering how they have worked and played with many western artists such as Slash, Billy Sheehan, Pat Torpey, Eric Martin, Larry Carlton, Aerosmith, etc, this is easily understandable. In their latest live in USA and their special live together with Linkin Park, Inaba easily change between English and Japanese. The band also employed many western artist for both studio recording and live performance and many times in their live DVD, it's shown that they talked to them without translator. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95XWDBNOfF8">This is an example of a B'z song in English.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This English version of Denji Sentai Megaranger's (the Japanese source for the U.S.'s Power Rangers in Space) full opening theme is in surprisingly good English, barring the (very) few odd grammar intonations and native accent: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YwwYB9Qlbk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YwwYB9Qlbk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Right now, the full lyric list can't be found, so some lyrics might be hard to interpret.)
</li><li> Tokyo Incidents can pull this off, as proven by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jmusicitalia.com/tokyo-jihen/video/noudouteki-sanpunkan-pv/4/">Noudouteki Sanpunkan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The first time you hear it, you may be shocked by the sudden transition to Japanese.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MiliyahKato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MiliyahKato">Miliyah Kato</a> usually only sprinkles English phrases here and there throughout her songs, she's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miw4-CJPoGU">rather<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnvOq3cQsV8&amp;feature=related">good<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.123video.nl/playvideos.asp?MovieID=15026">at<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.123video.nl/playvideos.asp?MovieID=10157&amp;Rel=1">it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManWithAMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManWithAMission">Man With a Mission</a>'s Jean-Ken Johnny and Tokyo Tanaka sing in remarkably good English despite being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Japanese</span> Ultimate Life Forms created by Jimi Hendrix with the heads of wolves on human bodies. A good listen to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Database</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Raise your Flag</a>" is enough proof.
</li><li> ABBA English was always good due to being Swedish, but what makes it especially apparent is Bjorn's ability to make his songs funny, e.g. Does Your Mother Know and Two For The Price Of One. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk691vvS0kw">this interview clearly explains<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Marie Serneholt was interviewed on Finnish Television, note just like ABBA, she's from Sweden, and yet her English is noticably interesting. Her ability English to speak sounded more American than the British version she and the rest of the A-Teens were taught; this was due to having been in the United States and having friends from the country as she explains.
</li><li> Ylvis, a Norwegian talk show host and band, have several songs in English with only slight accents. That their songs are uniquely odd is entirely beside the point.
</li><li> Namie Amuro's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jpopasia.com/celebrity/namieamuro/videos/neonlight-lipstick::39103.html">"Neonlight Lipstick"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> inexplicably has more English than it does Japanese, but said English is fairly well pronounced and manages to make sense.
</li><li> Even for a musician born in Japan who moved to America during high school, Angela Aki can move very smoothly between English and Japanese. Non-Japanese-speakers who start listening to her <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClnBfsu3zAo">"Kiss from a rose"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> thinking it's just another Japanese song are likely to not notice when she switches from Japanese to English until at least a few lines after it happens.
<ul><li> Not that surprising since her mother is an American, and her father is the founder of one of the biggest English schools in Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> rock vocalist and fashion pioneer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiSawada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiSawada">Kenji Sawada</a>, fluent in French and English, who produced an entire album in English, The Fugitive exclusively for Europe(It was later rereleased in Japan with the subtitle Ai no Troubadour.).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FEMM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FEMM">FEMM</a> has all of their songs in English with next-to-perfect pronunciation and grammar. For example, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fud4lDy4_Nw">"Kill the DJ".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a> has, since her <em>RAINBOW</em> album in 2002, started gradually sprinkling English lyrics into her songs. Her accent is still prominent - though it's improved in the past twelve years - but lyrically, the English lyrics she writes tend to be grammatically sound and present clear ideas. And it's <em>incredibly</em> rare to hear her mix up the l/r pronunciation - even back during <em>RAINBOW</em>, she nailed that part. She did, however, have a <em>little</em> practice with her <em>NOTHING FROM NOTHING</em> mini-album back in 1995.
</li><li> J-Pop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> E-girls has this in the usual "throw in some English words for flavor" fashion. But they usually make sense and are pronounced well.
</li><li> Japanese rapper COMA-CHI displays this in a similar fashion, usually in the form of rap clichés. But they're well-pronounced rap clichés. She does have more of an accent, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShiinaRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShiinaRingo">Shiina Ringo</a>'s English is very good (albeit still somewhat accented), no doubt helped by a two-month stay in London. Some of the English lyrics she sings are her own, and they're free of grammatical errors or similar writing flubs.
</li><li> Münster native Marian Gold, lead singer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville">Alphaville</a>, sings and writes lyrics in such excellent English that it's hard to place him as a native German, though his pronunciation of the "th" sound, which doesn't exist in German, is inconsistent.
</li><li> Singer nano, best known for doing themes for shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel">Arpeggio of Blue Steel</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Btooom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Btooom">Btooom!</a></em> and a ton of fan covers of songs posted on Nico Nico Douga, effortlessly switches between English and Japanese in her music with not a hint of an accent. She is a Japanese-American who was born and raised in New York City and moved to Japan when she was in her mid-teens.
</li><li> This shows up in a lot of 1980s Japanese pop and funk music, e.g. Toshiki Kadomatsu's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrLh66wwbzE">"If You Wanna Dance Tonight"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Hitomi "Penny" Tohyama's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E46Z-aP7urA">"Let's Talk In Bed"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Minako Yoshida's <a class="urllink" href="https://soundcloud.com/stika-spruce/minako-yoshida-tatsuro">"If You Want It"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a duet with Tatsuro Yamashita (as mentioned above).
<ul><li> Another notable example is Tatsuro Yamashita's wife, Mariya Takeuchi, who speaks and sings English very well. This is noticeable through her international hit, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNITQR4Uso">"Plastic Love"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but various other songs in her discography are also sung in full English, with only small traces of her native accent (for example, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEUoQn_Jhp4">"Broken Heart"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Considering she spent a year of high school as an exchange student in Illinois, this is perhaps unsurprising.
</li></ul></li><li> Hyakka Seiran, a CD series with Japanese voice actors covering famous anime themes, has a near-unaccented and perfectly intonated version of Skies of Love, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> opening. It was sung by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MinoruShiraishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MinoruShiraishi">Minoru Shiraishi</a></em> and - YMMV - he gave the original artist a run for her money.
</li><li> One of the draws of Finnish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rockers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall">Poets of the Fall</a>. Vocalist Marko Saaresto learned English from a young age, and affects an American delivery <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ompevuR1644?list=PLjACqN5i5sDWNukQKJcGtshQyIbaLHnZN">at will<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with remarkably few tells.
</li><li> The various international versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a> feature this to a truly staggering extent, combining it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingingVoiceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingingVoiceDissonance">Singing Voice Dissonance</a>. Several auditionies in non-English speaking countries flawlessly match the original acccent of the song despite having their native accent when they actually speak in English.
</li><li> Masato, frontman of Japanese post-hardcore band Coldrain, has some of the best English pronunciation of any rock vocalist in Japan. He's half-American and half-Japanese, and sings with zero trace of a Japanese accent.
</li><li> Kenta Koie of electronicore band Crossfaith is able to conduct himself rather well in English. His screamed vocal style masks some of his Japanese accent, but as the band have included more cleanly sung vocals on their recent albums, he's still able to sing in English very well, and speaks it well enough (albeit with a strong accent) to give interviews to Western media.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWF6qi8jhE">I'm a Lady Now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is sung entirely in English by a then-5-year-old Japanese girl. There are a few pronunciation mistakes due to singing a rather uptempo song, but Hotzmic otherwise seems to know English amazingly well for someone her age. This song was also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a> Megamix</em>. (More on that under Video Games.)
</li><li> Japanese heavy metal musician <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Kakka">Demon Kakka<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> spent several years of his childhood in New York, and as such is fluent in English. Many of his songs, including those written and performed for his old band Seikima-II, have grammatically correct English lyrics peppered within, and Seikima-II has even released several English self-cover albums!
</li><li> Ryo Kinoshita of Japanese metalcore/deathcore act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrystalLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrystalLake">Crystal Lake</a> is practically fluent in English. His pronunciation is spot on and the grammar in his lyrics is more or less perfect. If there is a member of the band to be interviewed, it will be Ryo for his English ability. That said, the other members are at a conversational level of English and do press with Ryo from time to time.
</li><li> Yui Kawashima and Yuto from Japanese metalcore act Earthists write all of their songs in English, justified as Yuto was an English literature major in college. Yuto's clean singing is free of any accent and after Yui's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">Vocal Evolution</a> his pronunciation got much better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecipherableLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecipherableLyrics">Whether you can understand Yui while he's screaming his brains out is another story.</a>

While the main track is in Japanese, the chorus repeats the title line with barely any inflections in it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</a></em> both feature surprisingly good English in the Japanese versions — this is because they were originally dubbed in English <em>and</em> Japanese in the original version. In fact, the only major difference between the original version of <em>5</em> and the export version is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s nickname is changed, due to the fact that Blaze's original nickname "Booby" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike">an English slang term for breasts.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade">Strider (Arcade)</a></em>, all of the characters actually speak their respective language (the Russian government speaks Russian, Strider speaks Japanese, Ton Pooh speaks Chinese, etc. etc.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersHistory">Fighter's History</a></em> series also had characters, for the most part, speaking their respective languages fluently. It almost lets you forget how big of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> many characters, like Ray, are ("BIG TORNADOOO! DYNAMITE!")
</li><li> The ending songs for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> games are in English, in both the Japanese and English releases. Unlike many Japanese songs in English, the words would be intelligible if not for the fact that the lyrics tend to be a bit overshadowed by the melody. In This Serenity (the ending song to the anime) isn't quite as well done, but is better than a lot of gratuitous English songs you hear in anime...
<ul><li> Ditto for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>. Yasunori Mitsuda composed the songs for Gears and Saga Episode I, and Joanne Hogg, from Ireland, sang them.
</li><li> Again for the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>. Hiroyuki Sawano composed many themes, even battle themes, with English (possibly as a reference to the fact that the survivors of the apocalypse are from the United States).
</li></ul></li><li> Considering that most American characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> games speak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> (Mr. Bogard being the worst of the bunch), it's a bit of a shock to fight Wolfgang Krauser, who has an actual English voice actor, B.J. Love (who also doubles as <em>Fatal Fury 3</em>'s announcer).
<ul><li> The great irony of this all being that Krauser is quite explicitly German. So...we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">All-American-ish Terry Bogard</a> speaking with such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">blatantly over exaggerated Engrish</a> to the point of parody...and on the other side, we have German Noble Wolfgang Krauser, speaking in perfectly clear, American-accented English. Yeaaaahhh.....
</li><li> B.J. Love also does Franco Bash, an Italian.
</li><li> Another SNK example is from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FuunSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FuunSeries">Fu'un Series</a> and first main boss, King Leo. While his shadow, King Lion, speaks with a clear Japanese accent, King Leo speaks perfectly American accented English courtesy of John Hulaton.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a>: 3rd Strike</em> also does this with Alex, Gill, Urien, Hugo, Dudley, and Q, all of which have not only English VAs, but ones who do their characters various regional accents fairly well (especially Dudley).
<ul><li> For its time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter I</a></em> had some limited but good English spoken.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElmuhFuddSyndwome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElmuhFuddSyndwome">Elmuh Fudd Syndwome</a> notwithstanding. "Wat stwength! But don't fowget dew aw many guys wike you, aww ovah da wowld!"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DonPachi</a></em>. While spoken by a Japanese actor, the accent is minimal and the grammar is correct. Granted, the acting isn't always perfect and some of the lines are downright corny, but it remains believable and sets the mood well enough.
</li><li> One song in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em>, "Que Sera Sera", is fully-sung in English by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kosei">Charlie Kosei<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who apparently grew up with English-speaking parents. While indeed Surprisingly Good English for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Series</a>, if you listen to the song closely, you can tell he's not a native English speaker. Peppered throughout the song are such lyrics as "word you up" ("wad you up"), "lup up" ("lump up"), and "wizyuu" ("with you"). The remainder of the lyrics are pronounced in a perfect American accent — which is actually another tip-off; all English-speaking Americans speak with some sort of regional accent.
</li><li> The entire intro to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1">Star Ocean</a></em> is spoken in English with Japanese subtitles and doesn't have any real glaring errors to speak of, this probably being mostly due to natural speakers delivering the lines. This doesn't carry over to other uses of English later in the game though, as seen from a computer that asks "CONNECT WITH WHAT?" when prompting for a username and responds to a successful input with a "COLLECT".
</li><li> Before it was released internationally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle">Sonic Battle</a></em> had the default Japanese script and an English script that could be turned on in the options. The latter is entirely grammatically correct and understandable by a native speaker - so much, in fact, that the <em>only</em> change made during localization was the removal of a mild swear word from Rouge's dialogue in her respective chapter.
</li><li> The Japanese video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalWolfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalWolfChaos">Metal Wolf Chaos</a></em> is voiced entirely in perfect English — it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">horribly cheesy English</a>, but perfectly pronounced and structured nonetheless. If not for the Japanese menu text and subtitles you would have sworn it had been made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">in America</a>.

It's good enough that the actual English logo doesn't change it at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The song "Eyes on Me", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, is sung with good English <em>pronunciation</em> by Chinese diva Faye Wong (and is actually used for part of the ending medley). The grammar leaves something to be desired, however ("Whenever sang my songs"/"Whenever said my words" and "If frown is shown then"/"Just reach me out then").
</li><li> The ending theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, "Melodies of Life", is performed in both Japanese (for the Japanese version) and very good English (for every other version) by Emiko Shiratori.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> has "Kiss Me Goodbye" sung in English and Japanese by Angela Aki.
</li></ul></li><li> The intro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X1</a></em> includes a warning from Dr. Light not to disturb the capsule X is kept in until his 30-year diagnostics are complete, with an explanation of what X is, and why the diagnostics are being performed. In the original <em>Rockman X</em>, this is written entirely in fully understandable and 100% mistake-free English, with Japanese subtitles running along the bottom. Consequently, when it was released in North America and in PAL territories, literally <em>nothing</em> was changed about it apart from removing the subtitles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">spelling Dr. Light's name differently</a>.
</li><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> Gaiden</em>'s attract demos, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">like</a> narrative, is narrated by an announcer speaking perfect English, though he puts unusually high emphasis on the "di" in "Gradius".
<ul><li> The other voice samples have good grammar and speech too, and not just in <em>Gaiden</em>, in fact all the way back to <em>Salamander</em>, the first Gradius game with English voices. In the Japanese too.
</li></ul></li><li> A large number of Konami original songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a></em>, and other Bemani games have perfect English—Naoki's songs ("Dynamite Rave" and "Love Again Tonight" just to name a couple), in particular, have a lot of natural-sounding English thanks to the addition of Western vocalists such as Paula Terry. Some other English-language songs, like "Moon", "Roulette" and other songs sung by Erika Mochizuki, on the other hand...
<ul><li> And for yet another "on the other hand" case... there's <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/bybkLlNbaaw">"Gold Rush"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The announcers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> and <em>Dance ManiaX</em> speak in perfect English. Those of other Bemani games, not so much, with a few exceptions (the announcers from <em>Pop'n Music 16</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX">beatmania IIDX</a> 16</em> are two such exceptions).
</li></ul></li><li> Raiden and Eagle's lines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a></em> sound, like, <em>really</em> good. Hell, Raiden's "ICHIBAN!" actually sounds like a non-native Japanese speaker is saying it. It's even grammatically correct and totally in character for him. "SAY YOUR PRAYERS, WIMP!"
</li><li> Billy Kane in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> series sometimes speaks good English. While he gets the occasional line like "I wish I could tear him apart!", most of his intros feature him saying generic things like "HEY HEY HEY!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em> makes almost everyone (except those two from Brazil) speak their countries most widely spoken language, often times having two characters speak to each other in different languages at the same time. So it was surprising to hear Jin speak English in Tekken 4.
<ul><li> As of <em>Tag Tournament 2</em>, Christie and Eddy speak their appropriate Portuguese, Miguel his Spanish, Leo her German, and Lili <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent">wrongly accented</a> French.
</li><li> Lei Wulong is also another example. Despite being Hong Kong, he's an International Super Police, so he's fluent in many languages, English included. The surprise is that he constantly speaks English voiced by a Japanese guy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroyaIshimaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroyaIshimaru">Hiroya Ishimaru</a>, the official dub voice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a>, the man Lei is based off on)
</li></ul></li><li> All spoken dialogue in the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinAndPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinAndPunishment">Sin and Punishment</a></em> is in Surprisingly Good English, only marred by the somewhat muddy audio quality caused by the game originally being cartridge-based.
<ul><li> Justified by the little fact that the game was always developed with an American release in mind, a release that was only canceled due to the Nintendo 64's pre-death decline stateside (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> release proves that people would have bought it if it was released before).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>:
<ul><li> The character Eriko from the Japanese version of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Persona 1</a></em> spent some time studying abroad in America. As such, she periodically slips into English that, although technically gratuitous, is generally well-formed and sensical. This is likely due to Atlus' willingness to do the research (this multilingual aspect was entirely dropped, rather than shifted to another language, for her counterpart Ellen in the American localization).
</li><li> The lyrics of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>'s soundtrack are almost completely in English, much of it decently grammatical. Barring a few lines (The "My Life" in "I reach out to the truth of my life", for instance), they're pronounced relatively fine, if a little hard to make out due to speed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has a fair deal of Engrish in its soundtrack's lyrics, but the rapping segments are in fairly good idiomatic English (accounting for the intentionally loose grammar), since rapper Lotus Juice spent most of his formative years in the United States.
</li><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena">Persona 4: Arena</a></em>, the series's main English lyricist is Benjamin Franklin (obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">not that one</a>), a native English speaker. Since then, the English lyrics been completely fluent and idiomatic, as well as more clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune">thematically resonant</a>, even though the actual pronunciation by the native Japanese singers is still sometimes less than stellar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>'s UI is filled with English text, which surprisingly enough is completely accurate and totally understandable, to the point that non-Japanese speakers can easily navigate menus even if they're playing the Japanese version. As with the previous <em>Persona</em> games, the game also has half a dozen songs with English lyrics ("Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There", "Life Will Change", "Last Surprise", "Rivers in the Desert" and "Beneath the Mask"), all of which have benefited from the Benjamin Franklin treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> The soundtrack for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a> Extreme</em> features English narration telling the story of the invasion between each group of songs. It doesn't explain much, but it's voiced perfectly.
<ul><li> Both SIE announcers too, especially the one for <em>Space Invaders Extreme 2</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> for the Wii, every character speaks their native tongue (except for the voiceless ones, like King Hippo) and is incredibly spot-on. Next Level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">gets bonus points for giving Great Tiger fluent Hindi</a>. Not only is there Surprisingly Good Hindi, but also Turkish, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese, and German.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EXIT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EXIT">EXIT</a></em> games (PSP, DS, Xbox 360), just about everything was in Surprisingly Good English, from the voice acting (more hits than misses), to the menus and text bubbles that show up in-game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope">Silent Scope</a>: Bone-Eater</em> has never been released outside of Japan, but features grammatically correct English subtitles.
</li><li> Capcom's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenVsStreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenVsStreetFighter">X-Men vs. Street Fighter</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish">Surprisingly Good English</a> from all the Marvel characters - thanks primarily to the voice actors of the 90's <em>X-Men</em> animated series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> is a great example of this, as almost all the voiceovers are performed by professional American voice actors, the game features several songs in English, and even the in-game billboards are written in perfect (and oftentimes downright funny) English. And a number of minor characters in the game (namely the Part-Time Job guy, the clerk at K-Entertainment, the owner of Area 51, and Thunder Ryu) speak in thickly accented Engrish. Note that this is a game afraid to leave its players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">scratching their heads</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> has a tendency to do this with their games when voice acting is involved. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> both have English voice acting, even in Japan. Viewtiful Joe's is excellent. Resident Evil's is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">not so much</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">It improves by</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">fourth game</a> though. This also hods true for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> series. Its easy to mistake it for a dub. Granted, the voice acting is very cheesy, especially in Dante's case, but anyone who plays it soon realizes that's practically the entire point of the series.
</li><li> Nearly half the dialogue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren">Siren</a>: Blood Curse</em> is in Surprisingly Good English. The rest is either in Japanese, or <em>intentionally</em> heavily-accented English.
</li><li> Even though it was a Japan-only title at the time, the entire game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pulseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pulseman">Pulseman</a></em> is spoken in good English (even by characters that are meant to be Japanese). While the English is correct, it doesn't technically match what it should be ("Water will destroy Pulse Man" doesn't mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>).
</li><li> EZ2DJ and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMax">DJMax</a></em> have the song artist <em>Ruby Tuesday</em>, which have some good English, if not cheesy, lyrics for Korean games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX">DJMAX</a> Portable Clazziquai Edition</em>, there is a bonus behind-the-scenes video about the video for the song "Dark Envy". The protagonist's actor answers the interview questions in fluent English with, oddly enough, no subtitles in Korean.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> is a mixed bag, for the characters that actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">have moves with English names</a>. Somewhat ironically, Chipp has fairly good English pronunciation... and instead yells gratuitous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese">Japanese</a></em> because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNinja">wannabe ninja</a>. Also, the announcers from XX onward speak perfect English, justified that they are Americans (Gregory Payne in XX to Slash and Neil Moody in Accent Core).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Genetos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Genetos">Genetos</a></em>. All of the English was translated by (a) Japanese speaker(s), and with the exception of a few odd word choices, could be understood by a kid who doesn't know what Japanese <em>is</em>. The English help HTML file even has a slightly heartwarming message from the author asking if "his friends overseas" would send him an email to correct any mistakes in the manual and the game. Of course, make sure you see the little prompt in the game's menu screens that says <em>L SHIFT = English</em>.
</li><li> The very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a>: The Battle Master</em> game had only one voiced segment in the entire game and it's the very intro itself, spoken in complete fluent English (with Japanese text) by an American narrator, the very same one who doubles as the announcer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Melee</em>, all characters (except Jigglypuff) retain the same voice actors between the Japanese and English versions. This results in some characters speaking in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> due to their Japanese voice actors, but Peach is voiced by an American actress and speaks in perfect English. The same applies to Mario and Luigi, although they have heavy <em>Italian</em> accents and only speak in very short stock phrases. In <em>Brawl</em>, while there are a lot more characters with different voice actors depending on version than in <em>Melee</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">Captain Falcon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid">Zero Suit Samus</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Peach</a> retain the same voice actors between the Japanese and English versions and speak very perfectly passable English, as do a number of Assist Trophies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario, Luigi, and Wario</a> all have heavy Italian accents, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">this makes sense</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParappaTheRapper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParappaTheRapper">Parappa The Rapper</a></em> video game series, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UmJammerLammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UmJammerLammy">Um Jammer Lammy</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper">all characters speak, rap, and sing in surprisingly good English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, even though the video game series itself was made in Japan. (By the way, isn't it odd that future <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em> star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaraRamirez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaraRamirez">Sara Ramirez</a> voiced Lammy among the list of the games' American voice actors?) This would seem to be because the games use American voice talent (though, funnily enough, Ramirez is Mexican), but this is with one exception: A man who goes by Ryu (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">no, not that one</a>), who voices Chop Chop Master Onion, Joe Chin, Ma-san and Captain Fussenpepper, who, while sounding appropriately Engrishy for Onion, sounds like the stereotypical hillbilly for the Captain. And it is this man who wrote the lyrics for every song in the entire series, which, aside from the occasional odd wording and bizarre spellings for certain onomatopoeias, leave no trace that this was ever devised by a Japanese person.
</li><li> The PC Engine CD/Turbografx-16 CD version of the Japan-only soccer game <em>Super Formation Soccer '95 Della Serie A</em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIOwAjH9Qws&amp;feature=related">the opening narration<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is narrated <em>in surprising good</em> (but corny, since the narrator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">over blows how popular is the Serie A league in Italy</a>) <em>Italian</em>.
<ul><li> The funniest thing is that the narrator, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rfi.fr/actubr/articles/103/article_12721.asp">Edison Mineki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, is a <em>Brazil-born Japanese-Italian</em>.

Zeami (his partner) then uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatorMicrobes">translating spell</a> so that Kabuki can speak and understand English, which renders all of the text and dialogue into Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">for the players' benefit</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> has its theme "Ring a Bell/Kane wo Narashite" sung in perfect English/Japanese by Bonnie Pink.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMen">X-Men</a></em> arcade game from Konami has an odd mixture of both this and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">"other" kind</a>, with the latter instances being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">the most famous</a> (at least among gamers).
</li><li> Sunsoft's <em>Galaxy Fight</em> features the than fighting game standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a> Golden Done, voiced by an <em>actual</em> native English speaking black man. His theme song (as horribly cheesy as it is), a lot of the incidental flavor text, and a few ambient announcements made during one stage are all fluently spoken/rapped and/or grammatically correct, as well.

The quality is such that some even believed the whole of the game's Japanese audio had been translated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Baraduke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Baraduke">Baraduke</a></em> (1985) has an international version named <em>Alien Sector</em> which is pretty unnecessary, since the whole game had all texts in mostly correct English anyway. Even the lone bit of digitized audio ("I'm Your Friend!!", spoken by the friendly alien at the beginning) sounds good, with only a little hint of Japanese accent.
</li><li> The vocal songs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> game <em>Clockwork Knight</em> were written and sung by Japanese people, and they came out decently enough. Special mention goes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingTheme">Ending Theme</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardBaitSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardBaitSong">"A Lullaby"</a>, which, save for the line "when loneliness bring you down", is sung in near-perfect English.
</li><li> A lot of the written English in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> is nearly perfect, even in the anime version - just try taking a look at the Alt Eisen and Exbein Boxer's screens sometimes. In Inspector, if you take a closer look, the Exbein's tiniest and most illegible text actually DOES read Weapon Selector (the creators didn't slack off, even on things people can't see well).
<ul><li> Granted, Banpresto tends to use several different languages in the franchise, from German to Spanish and most of it tends to be correct. So they probably just do their research well.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FROMSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FROMSoftware">FromSoftware</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> have no Japanese voice track; the English dub is the original. The Japanese releases still have Japanese subtitles, though.
</li><li> All <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat">jubeat</a></em> arcade games have a tutorial with announcer commentary in perfect English, despite the game being released primarily for the Japanese market.
</li><li> Though most foreign shipgirls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em> (as well as Kongou, who despite being the personification of a Japanese ship was born in England) tend to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousForeignLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousForeignLanguage">Gratuitous Foreign Language</a>, British battleship Warspite's English is nearly flawless, with her only mistake being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTropay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTropay">odd pronunciation</a> of "Admiral". She even goes so far as to use a proper British accent whenever she speaks English.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a> Megamix</em> uses the song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWF6qi8jhE">I'm a Lady Now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>," sung by the then 5-year-old Japanese girl Hotzmic. When Nintendo of America localized this for the Anglosphere, they left the song completely unchanged, as the lyrics and her English are perfectly understandable. (More on the song itself under Music.)
</li><li> Most of the lyrics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em>'s soundtrack are written in perfectly fluent and idiomatic English. Though a few of the singers are obviously less than fluent, many of them are actually native English speakers from the UK and the USA, and even some of the native Japanese singers have excellent pronunciation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>: Samus' narration in the game's intro is in English even in the Japanese version of the game, with Japanese subtitles at the bottom of the screen to translate it. All the localizers had to do was remove these subtitles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> has something of a meta example. The character of Tsukasa is meant to be fluent in English, and often peppers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> into his speech, but his pronunciation is not very good (he sounds as though he's perpetually clenching his teeth). However, the voice actor for Kaoru actually <em>is</em> fluent in English due to having grown up partially in America, as demonstrated in <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/mai_ryotaro/status/968482008023187461?lang=en">this famous (and much memed) video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of him introducing himself in-character in English. Sadly, it doesn't fit Kaoru's backstory for him to know English, so it's never come up in-universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> has an English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningCrawl">Opening Crawl</a>, even in the Japanese version. (With provided Japanese subtitles, similar to how the opening of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a> was in German). It's written in perfect English, though it is obviously translated from Japanese since parts of it are phrased strangely. (For instance, instead of ending with "and none can say who will triumph", it says that perhaps only the moon knows who will be victorious). Strangely enough it was completely rewritten for each of the English releases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza3">Yakuza 3</a></em> features an American as one of the principle villains, voiced by an actual American VA (Charles Glover) among the predominantly Japanese voice cast. Said villain speaks perfect English and is somehow able to hold a conversation with Kiryu who only speaks Japanese. Additionally, the English spoken by the Japanese Joji Kazama and Mine, while heavily accented, is quite gramatically sound.

<ul><li> In the early French computer-animated short <em>Computer-Home</em>, from 1989, the <em>Mega Fright</em> video game taunts the player when they power it on. In both the French original and the English dub, it is spoken in correct but noticeably-accented English:

Although since she was in a very prominent position when she was introduced (as Coco's assistant) she would be expected to know English for business reasons. She never appears to run into a language barrier with Chaz.

<ul><li> Perhaps YOU, dear troper, should you not come from the Anglosphere.
</li><li> Japanese Actor Kei Hosogai. Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Gokaiger</a></em> fans outside of Japan were surprised by his fluent unaccented English. Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> fans upon learning this are hoping he would reprise his role of Basco on <em>Power Rangers</em>. Though when one learns he spent most of his childhood and early adult life in Seattle and Hawaii, it's not surprising.
</li><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHong">James Hong</a> is fluent in English, being a Minnesota native. For most of his acting roles, he's actually had to <em>fake</em> a Chinese accent (not always successfully).
</li><li> Pat Morita was born and raised in California and spoke perfect English, faking a Japanese-sounding accent for his most famous roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid">The Karate Kid</a></em>. His real name really was Noriyuki, too; "Pat" was the stage name, not the other way around as sometimes claimed.
<ul><li> When initially casting for <em>The Karate Kid</em>, he was rejected for not "sounding Japanese enough". So he went to an elderly relative, who immigrated from the old country, and brushed up on his "authentic Japanese" accent and mannerisms. His second casting call was much better received. The accent he used in the film was one he learned from his stunt double Fumio Demura, who actually was a recent immigrant from Okinawa.
</li></ul></li><li> Comedian Henry Cho is an interesting variant. Being a lifelong resident of Knoxville, Cho is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">a Korean-American with a completely natural Tennessee accent</a>, which he freely permits is okay to find funny.
</li><li> Inverted in the case of Jake Adelstein. Being the first American journalist to work as a Japanese-language reporter for a major Japanese newspaper, Surprisingly Good Japanese was a requirement; he even scored better in proficiency tests than native speakers. The flipside: because he spent so much time speaking it in an all-Japanese environment, when a case required him to interact with English speakers, he found himself stuttering over his words and even veering towards Engrish at times. He recovered pretty quickly.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> guitarist Marty Friedman, now based in Japan, speaks Japanese well enough to host his own show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RieFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RieFu">Rie Fu</a> was raised in the U.S. state of Maryland and attended college in English, so much of the English in her music sounds like actual English.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukioMishima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukioMishima">Yukio Mishima</a> spoke <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPAZQ6mhRcU">really eloquent and excellent English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even more impressive as he taught himself the language - as a student in post-WW2 Japan, Japanese students weren't permitted to study abroad, and so he listened to tapes of English speakers every day. He could apparently speak German and Chinese as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UtadaHikaru">Utada Hikaru</a> is bilingually fluent in Japanese and English — in fact her debut album, released in Japan was made up exclusively of English songs. It helps that she was raised in New York.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MariIijima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MariIijima">Mari Iijima</a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Macross</a></em> fame, is fluent in English (though she still speaks with a noticeable accent). Her language skills were good enough for ADV to ask her to reprise her iconic role, <em>in English</em>, for their <em>Macross</em> release.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukoGoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukoGoto">Yuko Goto</a> is very proficient in English. Directors in Japan will occasionally take advantage of this, as did Bandai USA during their <em>Haruhi</em> promotions.
</li><li> Members of small nations who don't share their language with any other countries, such as Scandinavians and in particular, the Dutch. It is because foreigners seldom bother to learn <em>their</em> languages, so they are taught English (and other foreign languages) at school, and have a large incentive to remember it because not doing so means being cut off from a lot of international communication and culture.
<ul><li> It's also because their languages are closest to English in terms of verb structure and in the case of Dutch, has some of the same words. In Scandinavia, movies are shown in English with subtitles, and much of the music people listen to is done by English-speaking artists, and the Swedish musicians often have perfect English as well. Many people you try to talk to in their language will realise you are a native English speaker and speak to you in it instead.
<ul><li> English, Dutch, and German are all in the same language branch (West Germanic) and are thus very closely related. If you speak one of these, the other two will be MUCH eaiser for you to learn than any other foreign language. The Scandinavian languages are a different (but still fairly closely related) branch called North Germanic. Not quite as closely related to English as the other West Germanic languages, but still within the same general family.
</li></ul></li><li> Israel is also a notable case. Like many other countries formerly ruled by the British and currently heavily exposed to American media (which it never dubs, unless its aimed at children), most Israelis now speak at least enough English to get by, and a tourist never has to ask anyone if they speak English. For a while, there was a generation of Israelis who learned English through the European <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> (that was the only kids channel in English with no dub and no subtitles) developing a fairly impressive accent, but nowadays it no longer airs in Israel.
</li><li> Many people in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) speak fluent English, due to British influence, to the point where it is a national language.
</li><li> The same would go for many African countries, which would surprise many Westerners.
</li></ul></li><li> The novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, though born in Japan, has lived in England for most of his life <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SmuYqKeTTs">and it shows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Korean singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY">PSY</a> went to college in America, and is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EORCeIVIWQ0">fluent in English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which helped a lot during the "Gangnam Style" craze as he could easily appear on American talk shows.
</li><li> Japanese idol Ayaka Komatsu speaks and <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTijD8KNDPw">sings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> very good English. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">Amusingly enough</a>, the character she played in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></em> is Minako Aino, who is another example of this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48">AKB48</a> member Sayaka Akimoto is also great at English. Her Filipino Mother probably taught her the language well.
<ul><li> Played Straight with Rina Hirata as she was raised in Arizona for most of her life and she was the main English announcer for AKB48 when they had their concert in Washington DC. She also uploads 30 second English lessons on her Google+ on a regular basis.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>, and sites like it. Users for whom English is a second language often post in English so good it puts many native English posters to shame.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderSkarsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderSkarsgard">Alexander Skarsgård</a>. Although he has an noticeably thick Swedish accent while he speaks off-the-cuff, when he has time to prepare, he speaks American English well enough to play All-Americans like Brad Colbert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GenerationKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GenerationKill">Generation Kill</a></em>, in spite of being well into his twenties when he moved to the U.S. to pursue his acting career.
</li><li> Many other Nordic actors are so good at English that they'll frequently play American or British characters; such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen">Mads Mikkelsen</a>.
</li><li> Tiffany and Jessica of the Korean girl group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsGeneration">Girls' Generation</a> were born in America. They've surprised more than one American morning show host who assumed all members are native Korean.
<ul><li> This trope is actually fairly common throughout the whole world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic">Korean Pop Music</a>, due to the near constant influx of Korean-Americans choosing Korea as where they'll try their luck at a music career. From idol groups to hip-hop, it's not at all unusual to run into an American or two while looking into Korean music.
</li></ul></li><li> It might not be obvious from the way he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">chews out other developers</a> on the Linux kernel mailing list, but Linus Torvalds is actually a native Swedish speaker. Torvalds is part of Finland's native Swedish-speaking minority. Linux's success has been partly attributed to Torvalds' fluency in English making him able to attract developers over the Internet.
</li><li> As shown by Linux, English is, for better or for worse, the lingua franca of computer science. Programming language documentation is in English and very rarely translated, as are forums and IRC channels. This means that there's a real incentive for developers to acquire a reasonably good command of English, even in countries where most people don't bother.
</li><li> Kotaro Uchikoshi, the writer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17">Ever 17</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape">Zero Escape</a>, claims his English is not that good but is competent enough to communicate with fans on Twitter and Facebook. He is also known to make ridiculously complex English anagrams used as important plot points in his games.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlizeTheron">Charlize Theron</a>'s first language is Afrikaans and she learned English with an American accent. As a result people unfamiliar with her just assume she's American - and she rarely plays non-Americans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaMayWong">Anna May Wong</a> ran into this in her time during the 1920s. As someone who got famous during the Silent Era of films, people assumed she either only spoke Chinese or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a>. But as she was third-generation Chinese who grew up in San Francisco her English was perfect. She even got vocal training at Cambridge when she worked on the stage in England.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyKwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyKwan">Nancy Kwan</a> likewise ran into this merged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">I Am Not Spock</a> thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldOfSuzieWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldOfSuzieWong">The World of Suzie Wong</a></em>, where she played a poor prostitute who spoke in broken English. In contrast to her character, Nancy had a privileged Eurasian upbringing and spoke perfect English.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> says that when she was in WWE, people from the creative team kept asking if she spoke any Korean and seemed exasperated when she replied no because she was born and raised in Canada. She suspected they may have wanted her to do a gimmick similar to Tajiri.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexisBledel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexisBledel">Alexis Bledel</a> surprises many people when she reveals that her first language is actually <em>Spanish</em>, and that she's of Mexican and Argentinian descent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">as she is quite pale skinned</a>).
</li><li> Gong Li in fact knew no English when she starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MemoirsOfAGeisha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MemoirsOfAGeisha">Memoirs of a Geisha</a></em> and had to learn her lines phonetically. And she ended up getting the strongest reviews out of the cast. Ziyi Zhang also had to learn English for the film.
</li><li> Hong Kong actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieCheung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieCheung">Maggie Cheung</a> speaks perfect English with a London accent because she moved with her family to London at the age of eight and lived there for the next ten years.
</li><li> Most non-Anglophile heads of state at least speak passing English. At lot of this comes from them having been educated at American and/or British universities. The only leaders of top-twenty GDP economies who don't speak a lick of English are Chinese premiere Xi Jingping, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, despite coming from a country with high English-speaking rates, isn't quite fluent because she grew up in communist East Germany where it was't taught as prominently. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and French President Emmanuel Macron also aren't 100% fluent but have given speeches to the US Congress in English. Indian PM Narendra Modi speaks English fluently and has done rallies in the US and given speeches to the Australian Parliament. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is perhaps the best at English. He speaks it near-flawlessly which comes from him spending the majority of his time between his high school years and his early thirties living in America.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a> is notorious for having a foul mouth whenever he interacts with English speakers on Twitter. When asked about speaking English in public, he feels too embarrassed as he thinks it isn't good enough. From what English is shown in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mogQcc4aqrM">this Mega64 clip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he sounds like a natural.
