<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em>, this is revealed to be the underlying reason for the creation and maintenance of the sex-segregated planets of Meger and Talark where children are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a> artificially engineered through mixed-cloning of the original colonists — majority of whom still remain secretly secured in cryo-stasis — as the colony leaders were unwilling to sacrifice any natural-born children to the organ-harvest fleets of Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> A very powerful young woman named <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikoto Misaka</span> is cloned 20,000 times, so that the clones can be killed in an experiment to increase Accelerator's power. She's mildly put off by discovering the existence of the clones, but she <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">goes berserk</a></strong> when she learns they're being killed off <em>en masse</em> for an experiment. The poor girl then breaks down when said clones dispassionately claim that they are simply "180 000 yen <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dfu9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dfu9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dfu9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">around 2000 dollars</span> lab animals".
</li><li> The very first clone, Full-Tuning/Dolly, is this even more than the others. She was never designed to take part in the experiments; she was just a prototype they used to test the cloning tech to make sure that the rest of the clones would survive long enough to be of use. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even further, Dolly and Full-Tuning are actually two separate clones, made at the same time. Dolly was the experimental clone, while Full-Tuning was the control, kept safe inside her cloning tube while Dolly was tested. Once Dolly died, her memories were downloaded into Full-Tuning as a backup</span>.
</li><li> This is made even worse with the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Accelerator experiment was always intended to be scrapped. The real plan was to distribute 10,000 Mikoto clones around the world, then take advantage of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> in order to create a combined supercomputer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">belief generator</a>. That is, 20,000 clones were produced so that they could kill half of them as a <em>smokescreen</em>, then get the survivors into position under the excuse of medical treatment.</span> It's next to no wonder that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mikoto</span> ultimately develops one HELL of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterInstinct">Big Sister Instinct</a> towards the clones that still live.

If that happened to one of them, his memories and personality would be downloaded into the next volunteer to receive the treatment, replacing previous ones. Thus, the next one would know any information learned by his predecessor, <em>including</em> every past failure and death. (The idea was to help them avoid whatever mistakes had led to them.)

A few clones later, it turns out Calvin <em>really</em> doesn't get along with himself, and ends up turning them all into worms (but, as Calvin knows, this makes them happy, because now they're gross). Later, Calvin creates a <em>good</em> duplicate of himself that doesn't mind doing his chores, but ends up driving Calvin crazy anyway by trying to be nice to Suzie.

Some other EU authors took this idea up and had various high-ranking Imperials have possession of their own personal cylinders. The most notable one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Ysanne Isard</a>, who would send out her clone, who believed herself to be the original, to do jobs she could entrust to no one else.

All of the main characters are expendable clones, basically a living simulation to iron out all the kinks in the mission before sending out "Real" people. They're not meant to survive. This isn't a spoiler: the audience finds this out at the very beginning of the book. The characters take a lot longer.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune">God-Emperor of Dune</a></em>, Leto II has had a series of Duncan-clones (one at a time) serve as advisor/companion the entire time he's been ruling (several <em>thousand</em> years). It's gotten to the point where he knows Duncan so well he can basically read his mind. He takes great delight anytime one of them actually deviates from his expectations or the behavior of the previous Duncans.

These collectives are called copyclans, and their members synchronize their memories and brainpower whenever they are together, allowing them to be everywhere in their massive empire at once. It doesn't matter if a few die, since there's always backups. Although their interests don't always coincide, and some of the Founders are said to be in war against themselves. If fact, in the Sobornost Collective <em>everyone</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">Expendable Clone</a>; only the Founder Primes are an exception.

One of Mark's main goals in life is to shut that industry down.

The truth is only discovered during the autopsy, when someone notices that the dead body's bones are in too good a condition, especially since the "deceased" is known to have broken a few bones throughout his life, which means there should have been traces of that. He also backs up his consciousness on a computer. Desperate for answers, someone suggests creating another clone of the traitor and having the consciousness downloaded into it (it would be pointless to do it with a non-matching brain, as the neural pathways would be all wrong). An almost-clone (an enhanced special forces soldier) is created and is given the name Jared Dirac. However, he has no memory of the original. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually recovers some of the memories and manages to track down the traitor. The traitor himself treats Dirac as this trope, deciding to transfer his current consciousness into Dirac in order to infiltrate the Colonial Defense Force and spread his virus.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">technical manuals</a> explain that this is not the case, as the transporter works on a <em>quantum</em> level rather than a <em>molecular</em> one, and people who believe this in story are dismissed as having an irrational fear of transport. This explanation also avoids the issue of why antagonistic races don't simply duplicate their foot soldiers via transporter to make a disposable army.

</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> has Aeon captured and her DNA used to make clones for Travis Goodchild. The initial clone escapes and trades places with the real Aeon. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inverted at the end of the episode, when the real Aeon is killed and the clone becomes the show's new protagonist. Note that in this case all the memories and personality were duplicated as well.</span>
</li><li> The Republic troopers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> are treated as pretty much expendable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">and they know it.</a> You can tell who is supposed to be a good guy and who is supposed to be a jerk based on who treats them as expendable and who tries to point out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo">Clones Are People, Too</a>.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em> had a future where Mandy was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> with the body of a giant worm, and she had an endless supply of Billy clones who kept getting killed due to his stupidity. After the latest one dies insulting one of her monsters, causing it to eat him, she just sighs and says, "I lose more Billys that way". The whole episode is a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune">God-Emperor of Dune</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies">"Too Many Pinkie Pies"</a>, Ponyville is overrun with several dozen magic copies of Pinkie Pie. Twilight Sparkle finds a spell to banish the copies; though she hesitates to use it for fear of banishing the original, she has no qualms about using it on the clones.
</li><li> Starscream of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> treats his army of clones about as well as anyone else who falls under his command (poorly). However, in the episode "A Fistful of Energon," Starscream uses two of his clones as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">bombs</a> that detonate when placed closely together, despite the two individuals having displayed sentience and self-preservation earlier in the episode. When that move fails he notes that he has plenty of replacements.
</li><li> Starscream of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> stumbles upon the Harbinger, a derelict Deception warship with protoforms in its hold. He used a portion of himself to create four clones, who turns out are largely loyal to him and whom he considers far more expendable than the "original". Unfortunately, Starscream later learns that, because he had used his own genetic material in creating the clones, he suffers phantom pains whenever they're attacked.
<ul><li> Also unfortunately for him, one of the clones is brutally beaten to death by Bulkhead, while another two are gunned down by Megatron's fusion cannon (and the original Starscream somehow survives through all of this). He decides to off the last clone himself, as he needed the clone's T-Cog and because said clone was about to turn on him (and the clone didn't have the same "drawback").
</li></ul></li><li> The Party Starters service of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> employs the clones of kidnapped extreme partiers as rentable hosts. Each one is set to explode after the rental expires.
</li><li> There's a... variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>. Princess Bubblegum created the original candy people, and from that point on we're not sure how they reproduce, if they reproduce at all. It might be the same generation of artificially created characters still alive today, their clones, or their traditional offspring. Regardless, PB sees them as somewhat expendable. In one episode, she allows an ice cream sandwich man to sacrifice himself for their survival rather than Finn the Human, because she's able to clone a new James, but not a new Finn. In his next episode, James II has come to see himself as somewhat expendable, willing to risk his life over and over because each time PB thinks he's died, she clones him again and awards the clone a medal. While we don't know if any of the clones actually did die in their attempts at glory (there are multiples living in James's house), the way he constantly throws himself into danger leaves the possibility open.
</li><li> In the first three seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, Dr. Venture doesn't seem terribly concerned about his son's well-being on their dangerous adventures. It initially comes off as parental negligence, until we learn that the boys are just the latest in a series of clones who have died and in turn been replaced. He begins treating the boys differently when the government finds out and puts a stop to this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies">Squidbillies</a></em> The entire police force of Dougal County is staffed by an unending cabbage patch of clones of the Sheriff. He is frequently killed or dismembered and replaced with another Sheriff.
</li><li> Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem">a coalition</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MulticulturalAlienPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MulticulturalAlienPlanet">of several</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneArmy">Clone Armies</a>. The Gem Homeworld's leadership treats them all as various degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">expendable</a>, valuing each individual gem less the more of their type are around. Rubies, in particular, are common gems used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a>, and when a Ruby and a Sapphire (a much rarer gem) committed a crime, only the Ruby was told she'd be punished.
</li><li> The Box More robots from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> are mass-produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, and the ones sent by Boxman to attack the Plaza appear to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemoteBody">remote controlled</a> from the servers at the factory, so when one is destroyed, another one comes off the assembly line and picks up where the previous one left off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Episode 134, Stumpy is granted a wish and gets a bunch of clones of himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When he needs to get rid of then, he sends them through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate">Cool Gate</a> into another dimension forever, and nobody cares.</span>
</li><li> In "Let's Play Hide 'n Hunt", Mr. Cat clones Kaeloo, Stumpy, and Quack Quack in the hopes of being able to kill the clones without losing the three of them for real.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>: while being interrogated by the FBI, Krieger asks "is it <em>murder</em> if they were my own clones?". He later has to clarify that he genuinely doesn't know.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is one of the philosophical/moral quandaries behind the ethics of cloning, particularly the idea of "growing" full-body people for harvesting organs that are identical matches. This is an old-fashioned fear even today, since we already know that cloned organs can be grown in pigs or sheep instead of human bodies, and we aren't far from growing at least some organs in vitro, as well.
</li><li> Aphids, tiny sap-sucking insects capable of parthenogenesis, form colonies in which small clone-daughters are pushed to the edge of the group, where most aphid-eating threats attack first. They're essentially created as easy meals for predators, to sate attackers' appetite so the core of the colony can stay safe.
