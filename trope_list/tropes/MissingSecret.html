<div class="acaptionright" style="width:350px;">If the game's cleared, what's that empty space?</div>




So you have a game with lots of hidden areas, secret stashes of powerups, and generally all kinds of rewards for exploring and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardingVandalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardingVandalism">busting down walls</a>. You're at the end of the game and have every powerup you've seen, but... why is there still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">an empty slot in your inventory</a>? Does that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">bridge get fixed at all</a>? Where is the ultimate upgrade for the laser gun? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisconnectedSideArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisconnectedSideArea">How do you get to that island in the distance</a>?!

That broken bridge was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsForRuinsSake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuinsForRuinsSake">there for flavor</a>. Not every type of weapon has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">ultimate variant</a>. The island in the distance is just part of the skybox. There's no reason to be paranoid because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>; the game just never tells you this, so you're left to wonder what you're missing out on.
</p><p>This is often spawned from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyRoomPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyRoomPsych">Empty Room Psych</a> or something that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>, and often creates an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">Urban Legend of Zelda</a>.

It has <em>absolutely zero</em> relevance to anything, ever.
</li><li> In the main waterway of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfCanals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfCanals">City of Canals</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>,</em> there's a secret side-waterway you can get to by hopping over a laser barrier. There are a few twisty passageways back there, as well as what appears to be a lowered gate that, if opened, would lead to another side-area. The camera even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePan">pans over to it as if it's supposed to be important,</a> but there's no way to open it. However, it is possible to glitch you way through it—revealing that it still contains a working warp, which teleports you to a glitchy, unfinished map there's no way to escape from. Whatever was meant to be back there was removed long ago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em>, a bug causes one chest to never register as opened. If the player returns to the location with an item that reveals collectibles on the map, that chest will still show up, even though it's no longer there. Doubly annoying since there are actually a few chests that are marked on map but only appear when some action is performed.
</li><li> The Rare-developed title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrabbedByTheGhoulies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrabbedByTheGhoulies">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</a></em> has quite a few secrets just beyond reach and nearly unlockable features like its <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> counterpart. Touring the game you'll manage to pick up 100 secret collectible 'Rare' tomes called 'Bonus Books', collecting a set number will allow you to unlock certain features and bonus content — so imagine the rancor of players who manage to stumble across a pile of Bonus Books just beyond a thick gate arranged into a question mark. It doesn't help that the 'Jukebox' feature seen in the manual wasn't in the final game, leading players to believe that if there were some way to get beyond the grate they could unlock the hidden audio feature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">licensed games</a>
<ul><li> Each level in the second <em>Harry Potter</em> PC game features "secrets" of any kind, but for some reason the Chamber of Secrets level announces one more secret than what you can actually find.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> <em>Chamber of Secrets</em> game, you are told that the alohomora spell will allow you to 'unlock all kinds of things'. So long as they're prize chests and not the numerous temptingly locked doors scattered throughout the game.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version of the second game has some doors in Hogwarts that can't be unlocked no matter what.
</li></ul></li><li> There are some doors that are just not meant to be opened at all in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em>. Also, you can get a maximum of 60 level-up points <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unless you use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon">Null Driver</a></span>, just three short of the number required to max out all your stats. Lampshaded in one instance where using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Nuke</span> to get across a certain gap triggers a response from Iji that there is nothing there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia">Illusion of Gaia</a></em>, there's a little hole next to the second dungeon's entrance, just the right size to Psycho Slide through — but you don't get that ability until rather later in the game, and at that point, there's no way back. Using a cheat device to give Will the ability early reveals that the hole is just decoration, as solid as any other wall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>, there were a series of AR Cards that you could use with the game, generally distributed at events. A total of 412 cards are programmed into the game, but cards #405 and #411 were never released, though they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">are still in the game's data</a>. Card #411 was ultimately revealed online, <em>six years later</em>, as a promotion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>:
<ul><li> Near of the beginning, Link's wounded uncle tells him "Zelda...is...your..." before passing out. Apparently, many players assumed the missing word was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling">"sister"</a>—since this is never brought up again over the course of the game, people have searched for some hidden sidequest that reveals their relationship. In fact, the line was intended to be "Zelda is your destiny", as stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the manual</a>.
</li><li> There are a number of cracked walls. Some can be blown open by bombs while some can be knocked down by being rammed into with the Pegasus Boots, but others aren't affected at all by either of those. Some players have wasted many hours searching for a bomb upgrade to blow these walls open. The closest thing to a bomb upgrade is the red bomb, which opens up a specific location, and is never a standard inventory item. These cracks are merely for decoration. Generally speaking, if cracks aren't positioned on the center of the wall in any given room, they're just decoration, and the decorative cracks are only seen in dungeons, anyhow. However, there's a cave somewhere on Death Mountain that has a noticeable cracked wall, in a relatively obvious spot, but it can't be cracked open in any way. This is the only instance of this happening in a <em>cave</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> is known for this as well:
<ul><li> That Triforce-shaped icon in your inventory is merely a decoration and doesn't signify anything obtainable (note that it's raised in relief, where all empty item spaces are indented), Zora's Domain never gets unfrozen until the end credits (unlike every other bad effect Ganondorf causes upon the world)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g16s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0g16s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g16s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> notwithstanding</span>... and the Running Man never loses.
</li><li> In addition to being permanently frozen, Zora's Domain also houses two underwater tunnels. One of these tunnels is a shortcut that takes the player to Lake Hylia. The other is inaccessible through normal gameplay, and even if you use hacking tools or glitches to reach it, it doesn't lead anywhere. This has caused much speculation about it being the planned door to some scrapped content.
</li><li> There's a square hole in the ceiling of Darunia's room in Goron City that can easily be seen by both Links, but is never used for anything. It's been speculated that originally you'd have gotten inside his locked room via this hole rather than simply playing Zelda's Lullaby to unlock the door.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>, there are more item slots than items. This is probably to prevent a glitch that occurred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em> (which provided the engine for those games) that was caused by filling each slot before getting the last item, even though the situation that caused it does not exist in these games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a></em> gives you bonuses for finding homes in the village for two of three female travelers to your village. There is no way to get the third one a home, as this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">Development Gag</a> referencing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">the planned trilogy of "Oracle" games</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a>, of which only two were completed - in fact, the three travelers <em>are</em> those games' namesake Oracles. This is even worse in the European version, where Gorman (the guy who gets the women homes) says that he can build a third house if he could get rid of the stray cats on the lot. The cats disappear after a certain point in the game, but so does Gorman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> has a few of these thanks to its open nature.
<ul><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">completing every Shrine and slaying every Blight Ganon</a>, you'll be three upgrades short of maxing both Hearts and Stamina. How do you fill up those last three slots? You can't, because then the food items that give you temporary extra hearts/stamina would be rendered worthless. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> has enough new Shrines for one more upgrade, still leaving you two short.
</li><li> You can customize your horse's saddle and bridle at any stable, and one of the monstrous item sets you can get from creepy Kilton are the Monster Saddle and the Monster Bridle. All of Kilton's items involve and are based around the various enemies and monsters in the game, and these two items mention that he made them with a "monstrous" horse in mind. Two of the rarest horses in the game, which you can only tame temporarily and can't register at stables, are the Lord of the Mountain and the skeletal Stalhorse, which are both pretty monstrous.

Needless to say it isn't there.

There is no kind of victory screen or end credits rolling, but as far as anyone knows, there's nothing else. And in the first <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> game, there's a brick wall behind a sealed door in one level. There's no way of getting past it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> has one section of the overworld that's permanently clouded over on the map screen, and in one area of the game you can clearly see a bridge that leads over to that section, but it is impossible to reach the bridge. As a number of additional Colossi were planned for the game but never made, that area is probably where they would have been fought. In addition, the very top of the Shrine Of Worship is inaccessible, which is a little surprising in a game with so much emphasis on climbing things. You can reach the Secret Garden with enough effort, but that's only about 60% of the way up the tower, and you can't climb any higher than that.

However, the game requires you to get further in the game before you can get the right notes to cast it, and because you can't return to the first island until the very end of the game (where you are basically locked in the room with the Loom in it) it is impossible to find out what this draft does.

</li><li> In the edited NES release there's a keypad hidden on the second floor directly to the left of the Steel Security Door that leads back down to the 2nd Floor Landing. It is <em>super</em> glitched (no sprite, your character interacts with it in completely the wrong place), and the correct code is randomly generated every time you interact with it, making it highly unlikely that you will get it right. If you do get it right (by extreme luck or by memory hacking) all it does is open the Steel Security Door, which wasn't ever locked anyway.

The incoming damage multiplier has a stronger and incredibly well-hidden variant that reduces incoming damage to one fourth. There is also a second ammo multiplier, and it reduces ammo consumption to one fourth. It's hidden about as half as well as the second incoming damage multiplier, and only accessible if you return to one particular level as soon as you complete it.

The most notorious is likely the Shaolin Temple at the beginning of the game, where attempted entry yields a box of text saying that only a Shaolin monk may enter.

The space on the character select screen is always unselectable, and shows a duplicate picture of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cyber Sub-Zero</span>, who is selectable in the bottom left corner. In an odd twist, during multiplayer matches the player on the right can only select the bottom right corner, and the player on the left can only select the bottom left corner (especially odd since these corner spots then expand to show the downloadable characters, which as a result show up mirrored in each corner).

</li><li> The Ice Climber franchise is the only starter series without two stages; the stage menu shows an empty space under Icicle Mountain suggesting a 2nd stage. A second Ice Climber stage being planned was later confirmed by Masahiro Sakurai, who mentioned there was a second stage planned called Summit, which ended up being used in <em>Brawl</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>:

This gives the impression that the secrets are <em>there</em>, but you just didn't find any of them.
</li><li> Some old level-design books actually suggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">making a "secret area" trigger that can't be reached</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">so that players will continue to search for it</a>.
</li><li> There are also some official levels where it is impossible to get 100% secrets. In <em>Ultimate Doom</em> maps E4M3 and E4M7 due to bad map design; the former has secret sectors with torches on top of them, the latter an invulsphere that you can't reach and a door that's too thin for the secret to register. These can be triggered by noclipping, however. It's also impossible to get 100% items on Map 27 in the original <em>Doom 2</em> engine (though not in some sourceports), because there are two Computer Maps and you can only pick up one.
<ul><li> For years it was believed that <em>Doom II</em> Map 15 also had an example of this, due to a peculiarity of the engine; one of the triggers was on a teleport pad, but a teleporter activates when the player crosses the edge, which means you can never enter the sector and trigger the secret. This one was ultimately subverted, however, as in 2018 it was discovered that there <em>was</em> a way to obtain the missing trigger<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18tbe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18tbe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18tbe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Stand directly in front of the teleport pad and have an enemy push you into the trigger</span>; creator John Romero would confirm on Twitter that this was indeed the intended method of obtaining the trigger, making the discoverer technically the first person ever to 100% complete <em>Doom II</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The console ports of the early Doom games, which used somewhat redesigned levels, often didn't bother redoing the secret flags, making tons and tons of non-existent secrets still count as "not found" on the secret counter. Grr.
</li><li> There are also several instances where 100% items isn't possible due to said items not being flagged as multiplayer only in deathmatch areas. Map 6 of 'Requiem' for example has two berserker packs unobtainable in single player mode because of this.
</li><li> One of the many, many, <em>many</em> console versions of DOOM sometimes did this with enemies. One level of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDOInteractiveMultiplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDOInteractiveMultiplayer">3DO Interactive Multiplayer</a> port had a hidden Imp you could only kill by shooting into a blank wall.

Examining the map E2L2 in the BUILD editor shows that two adjacent sectors both have the secret area tag. The line they share also happens to be one used for splitting the area for shading purposes, so given how the BUILD editor handles tagging sectors which have been split (both get the tag of the parent sector), this instance is a clear oversight on the part of the developers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are 23 unlockable cheats, not the symmetric 24, generally assumed to be due to a missing level which would give a cheat called "line mode." This is accessible by a button press code, but has no legitimate unlock method in the final game.
</li><li> The game also has the infamous far-off outpost inside the water behind the dam in the first stage. It sits there fully rendered not doing anything, no enemies on it, and no programmed items. It was revealed by the <em>Goldeneye</em> team that it was supposed to be used, but they ran out of time to find a use for it. Rumor has it this is where you were originally supposed to retrieve the bungee jumping equipment.
</li></ul></li><li> People have not yet found the elusive Item 3 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityBone">Gravity Bone</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> levels "Colony Ship for Sale" and "Low Flying Defense Drones" there are rooms full of weapons and ammo that are inaccessable and just there to tease the player. Also, the rumored "A Good Way To Die" level. There are also many locked doors that never open; looking in a map editor reveals that there's nothing behind them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> ran this trope to hell and back. Some of its many, many examples include:
<ul><li> The infamous piece of cheese hidden in every level, which did absolutely nothing. Eventually one of the developers admitted they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">just there to mess with players</a>.
</li><li> The Pond Punk bar in the Chicago mission, which could only be accessed by disarming a guard, letting him run away, then following him up to the door, which he would unlock. A fully fleshed out area with multiple rooms and decorations, but the only things of interest are a pistol which you already have, and a piece of cheese in the bathroom.
</li><li> One multiplayer map had a grate in the ceiling marked with a large question mark. No way to open it of course. Other multiplayer maps had ammo boxes that could be easily seen in inaccessible locations.
</li><li> Some maps have extensive ventilation shafts. One of these shafts has a wall with a keyhole in it just outside the player's normal vision, but can be seen with the game's x-ray device.
</li><li> When Cassandra De Vries is killed in the Attack Ship mission on Perfect Agent difficulty, her necklace can be obtained from her corpse. Upon examining the necklace in the inventory, it gives the username "cdv780322" and the password "18M0ZYM8ND185" (speculated to mean "I AM OZYMANDIAS", <em>Ozymandias</em> being a sonnet by P.B. Shelley). There is no place where these can be entered in-game.
</li><li> Similarly, attaining the "Perfect" rank in multiplayer mode gives the username "ENTROPICDECAY" and the password "ZERO-TAU".
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> level "Pumping Station 2" technically has four secrets, but one of them is lacking a trigger and therefore won't register.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em>
<ul><li> Due to a few broken triggers, some secrets in <em>Serious Sam: The Second Encounter</em> don't exist but the secret counter still shows like they're there. It also shows up that the game's intro has one stage despite not being playable at all.
</li><li> In some of the games, due to bad counting, it's impossible to get all of the kills in a level. Basically, when the game calculates how many enemies are in a level, it counts all of the pre-placed enemies and all of the spawners. The problem here is that some spawners only spawn their enemies on certain difficulties, meaning that the game counts enemies that you can't kill due to playing on a difficulty where they never appear.

<ul><li> There is a room in Ape Atoll containing a monkey skull item that is impossible to enter. After being impossible to get for more than 5 years, a way of obtaining the monkey skull item was added, but not by entering the room, instead the monkey skull is a rare drop from zombie implings. There still is no way to enter the monkey skull room.
</li><li> There is a miniquest in the game where the player searches for the scattered body parts of a murder victim. One piece however is never found and after you find all the other pieces he is buried without it.
</li></ul></li><li> There are so many plots that dead end in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> that a list of them would double the length of the page. There are also quests and areas only available in earlier versions of the game; the plot has moved on and those quests are officially already over. The most famous of these was a legendary sword known as the Ashbringer. There were a very small handful of references to the sword in game, leading to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">rumors</a> and speculation, including an entire fansite dedicated to searching for it, but it turned out to not actually be in the game. The mass attention did lead to Blizzard introducing a corrupted version, but then the rumors and speculation turned to ways on how to purify the weapon, which couldn't actually be done. At this point, the weapon became so iconic that Blizzard handed it to a major character in the canon, who purified it himself and went on to wield it as his signature weapon. Only after all this time, in the Legion expansion, will players finally be able to wield the purified Ashbringer themselves.</li></ul></div>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em>:
<ul><li> Stop 'n' Swop one-upped this — you were supposed to be able to collect items in the first game to use in the second, but Rare failed to anticipate changes to undocumented N64 behavior, and the planned means of unlocking the items (power off, switch cartridges, and power back on within about half a minute) had to be abandoned. Presumably, the N64 Controller Pak could have provided the necessary memory, but they had released the first game with the intention of using the cartridge swap method, so it was too late to use that instead. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> rereleases fixed this. Of note is the fact that all the secret eggs and the ice key <em>can</em> be obtained in the N64 version of the original <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, by going into the sand castle in Treasure Trove Cove and inputting a VERY long code for each of the eggs/key. The codes were most likely going to be given in <em>Banjo-Tooie</em>.
</li><li> When you enter the room in Gruntilda's Lair where Tooty was imprisoned you can see a closed door, but there's no way to open it and it doesn't seem to be linked to the Stop 'n' Swop.
</li><li> In <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> has some strange loopholes:
<ul><li> Two are related to Bottles. The multiple-choice quiz sequence close to the end of the game uses different character text mugshots, with accompanying voice sounds. These mugshots are chosen randomly, but among them is an angry red mugshot that looks like Bottles and has his sound. Players tried to find this new Bottles to no avail until hacking found it to be part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> Counter-Op mode. The other supposed secret deals with Bottles' house. During the endgame, a party is held there and the characters won't let you in until you finish the game. However, upon entering the file again afterward, it's obvious the party is over, but the entrance is still blocked off. This connected to the Stop 'n' Swop rumors, but hacked entries would reveal nothing had changed in the house and the continued sealing was most likely a programming oversight.
</li><li> Some items and features that would be present (either by logic or by context) just aren't: Proximity Eggs cannot be obtained in single player, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlyItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlyItem">even if they can in multiplayer</a> along with the other egg types (this also leaves the Quagmire portion of Isle O' Hags the only one besides Jinjo Village not to have Jamjars teach the main characters any move). Three levels in the game (Mayahem Temple, Jolly Roger's Lagoon and Cloud Cuckooland) lack train stations and there are only 90 Jiggies instead of 100.
</li><li> <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> also includes a text string for the title of a supposed 'Ridiculously Secret Area'. No such area has ever been found, and some hackers suspect that Rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">included this as a red herring</a>, knowing that gamers would dissect the game.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em> has three:
<ul><li> A gated cave near the entrance to the Uga Buga chapter, where you pay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">the toll</a>, that looks like it can be entered but never opens.
</li><li> The top of the windmill looks like it has a path to a pressure switch on top of it. Too bad it gets destroyed before you reach it. Lampshaded by Conker saying "The windmill's been destroyed! I thought for sure that was the final level!" In the unofficial developer's commentary on YouTube, Chris Seavor confirmed it was intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> all along in <em>Bad Fur Day</em>'s development (though <em>Twelve Tails: Conker 64</em> footage shows Conker going inside it), hence Conker's comment.
</li><li> Inside the Poo Cabin there appears to be a rather large grate with a piece of chocolate just beyond reach through the bars. It looks as though the tunnel continues off to the left as well, leading players to scour the level to find some way to open the grate and gain access to the tunnel beyond. The grate even managed to appear in the remake, <em>Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded</em>, and once again could not be unlocked to gain access to the chocolate and whatever wild secrets might have been waiting just beyond the corner. The YouTube developer's commentary confirmed that, like the one with the Windmill, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">intended as a red herring meant to mess with the players.</a>

This is the only time a TNT Crate is triggered by an outside force like this <em>in the entire game</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ku32');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ku32" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ku32');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not counting the Ripper Roo boss battle that happened earlier in the game, or some TNT Crates in the Polar levels that trigger their countdowns automatically when approached</span>. TNT Crates being triggered in this way is such a deliberate act it's likely a leftover of a planned stage that was ultimately scrapped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> has a number of these — the most prominent being Cranky's mention of a secret level named Great Girder Grapple in the game's instruction booklet, which fans have hunted for for years. This was most likely a joke reference to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a> game</em>, which is a crucial element of this game. Another example is a barn with a number of doors in its loft, except one door that never opens. Before deciding on infinite lives, Rare intended to hide a 1-up balloon behind this door.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flashback">Flashback</a></em>, Restricted Area 1 is never accessible.
</li><li> The Nintendo 64-styled web platformer <em>Kiwi 64</em> has a presumably intentional example. There's an N64 cartridge locked in a cage, supposedly of the game's cancelled sequel, <em>Kiwi 65</em>; once you free it, it promises to let you play it if you bring it 60 clefs. Except you can't, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">there's only 59 clefs in the entire game</a>. A good number of people have wasted a lot of time running around looking for that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">last lousy clef</a>, not realizing it doesn't exist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7">Mega Man 7</a></em> has an empty spot in the weapon inventory menu. Naturally, this one drove fans bananas because the opening cinematic shows a cameo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Cut Man</a>, leading many to expect some means of battling him and acquiring Rolling Cutter for that slot.
<ul><li> Interestingly, <a class="urllink" href="https://tcrf.net/Proto:Mega_Man_7/Weapons#Menu">a prototype ROM<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows Proto Man's shield in that slot, and replaces the slot below it with Beat; since Beat was changed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPitRescueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPitRescueService">Bottomless Pit Rescue Service</a> in the final version, it's presumed that Beat was originally intended to show up as a weapon, like in the NES games. (Besides the graphics and menu slot, no code exists for the Beat weapon itself in either the prototype or final version.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> also has an empty spot in the weapon inventory menu.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series has a couple of examples.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a></em> lists Sandopolis, Mushroom Valley (Mushroom Hill), and Flying Battery in its level select, though you can't choose them. Like the wealth of <em>Sonic and Knuckles</em> tunes heard in the <em>Sonic 3</em> sound test, these are merely leftovers from before <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> became its own game. (For the record, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> versions of these levels do exist in the game's data — and so does Lava Reef Zone.)
</li><li> Scrap Brain Zone's third act in the 8-bit version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">the original</a> has only 99 rings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> had music from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> level (specifically, Hidden Palace Zone) left in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest">Sound Test</a>. More than that, a pre-release feature printed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> had a brief description of all levels, including the supposedly secret Hidden Palace Zone, which they promised to give hints about in the next issue. (They didn't.) None of the other beta levels are detailed here, which is not surprising, as Hidden Palace was cut very close to the game's final release, which would explain why its music is in the sound test, as mentioned above.
</li><li> There is no Metal Sonic holograms to be found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Metallic Madness</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld">Sonic Lost World</a></em>, you can receive optional mini-quests from Omochao on the world map. These missions range from accumulating a certain number of rings as you play to doing certain stunts with the Wisps or parkour actions to doing no-damage runs of levels and bosses. The prizes for completing a level range from free items to new vehicles and upgrades for Co-Op mode. After you complete all 100 missions, Omochao says "Congratulations! You did them all! I have a present for you!" You then receive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">absolutely nothing whatsoever</span>.
</li><li> The instruction manual for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix">Knuckles Chaotix</a></em> depicts a screenshot, using in-game graphics, of the island setting of the game. This image could not be found anywhere in the game whatsoever.
</li><li> When the HD version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> first came out, several Night stages, most notably Dragon Road, Jungle Joyride and Arid Sands, were revealed to have terrain beyond the goal ring, only accessible via glitches, and largely devoid of props (such as swinging poles) required to progress very far in them. To be extra teasing, even if one is unfamiliar with the glitches, all three are beyond closed gates or gaps that the player can see from the end of the respective stages. Additionally, some songs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest">Sound Test</a> were illustrated by screenshots from stages that weren't in the game, such as an underground waterway in Spagonia. Both mysteries were solved when the DLC stages were released: The unused areas and missing stages were featured in said DLC packs. The unused areas were likely cut due to the already-excessive length of the mandatory Night stages, while the missing stages with unique locations were likely cut due to disc space limitations. If the player isn't aware of the DLC, the trope remains evoked by the base game's content.

In <em>Ripto's Rage</em> and <em>Year of the Dragon</em>, beating the game would allow you to encounter Moneybags and recollect the gems you paid him throughout the adventure; this doesn't happen in <em>Enter the Dragonfly</em>, leaving you with 6,800 held gems out of 7,000 total (which the game still considers to be 100% gems) and no way to take back the 200 spent in Dragonfly Dojo. There are cut voice lines for a scene where Moneybags returns the gems, but it was never implemented and Moneybags only appears once in the final game.

Charging into the door causes it to bulge inward momentarily, as if it <em>can</em> be opened but is merely blocked from the other side or needs a stronger impact; it's the only door in the game to react this way, and it immediately seems like the perfect spot for a bonus level. Unfortunately, not only is there no way to open the door, but glitching the game to view the interior reveals that the small room beyond is empty anyway.

In the costume collection screen, ten rows are shown by default, but additional rows appear when you collect costumes that weren't present when the game was originally released (most of them added through completion of the Event Courses). Even with all 152 costumes collected, there are still seven empty slots in the sixteenth (and what is now considered final) row, each marked with the numbers 154 through 160 (the Mystery Mushroom itself, which by default randomly selects a costume you've already unlocked, takes up the very first slot). The last costume update was in December 2016, so the chances of the last seven slots being filled are next to nil.

Speculation ran rampant assuming that post-launch content, which was very prominent with the original game, would add another Style. That didn't happen: the game only got two updates after launch and neither added any.

There is no possible way to open this door at all, and using noclip reveals that there is nothing behind it anyway.

(Using the "noclip" cheat shows that there's nothing behind the doors, though.) Unsurprisingly, when the level editor for the game was published, several people created their own visions of what's behind those doors.

<ul><li> If one accesses the sound test, there is one song that never shows up anywhere else in the game. Players searched for one last racetrack in the game where this could be used. It turns out the song was originally to be used for an already accessible racetrack whose music was replaced with another one late into production.
</li><li> Spaceport Alpha, in Future Fun Land, features a very conspicuous nook hidden near the beginning of the racetrack, which most players would nevertheless only notice if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">did a U-turn out the starting gate and started driving backwards.</a> In all four previous worlds, there's one racetrack per level that features a key hidden away in a similar nook, which unlocks a hidden mini-game for that world. Future Fun Land, however, has no such mini-game... and despite the nook seeming to suggest that one did exist at one point, it's completely gone from the final game. In addition, looking at the track selection menu, which forms a grid shape with said mini-game tracks making up the far right column, rapidly switching between selected tracks will sometimes display the edge of the icon for this theoretical Future Fun Land mini-game track, though too little is visible to make anything out of it.
</li><li> After you beat Adventure, the game says "To be continued." Many assumed this message was referring to Adventure 2 but you get the same message when you beat that. Much confusion happened as a result. It doesn't help that the sound test has a seemingly unused audio track that sounds like dinosaurs being shot by Wizpig's ships and, when choosing a track in Versus Mode, if you go diagonally from the last track of the game to the trophy challenge of the previous round, the screen will scroll across an otherwise offscreen option you can't highlight but you don't get to see what it is because it doesn't have time to load.

A yellow light shines on it, making it appear green. It is the only Thwomp in the game to not slam down on the floor as an attack, preferring to hover in place indefinitely. Naturally, rumors about this supposedly green Thwomp spread like wildfire, both about what it could do if set free and why it was caged in the first place. There is still no official explanation for that Thwomp. It even returned when the course was brought back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartWii">Mario Kart Wii</a></em>.

<ul><li> The American Version of <em>Dance Dance Revolution Extreme</em>, released in 2004, lacked a congratulatory message for completing all the songs in the game on any difficulty but the Challenge difficulty. Without any official word, it seemed like this was just a bug. However, in 2006, Konami had a cross promotion with Burger King - and as part of that promotion, the secret code to unlock a secret song (Memories, which doesn't contain a Challenge chart) was finally released. Completing this song along with all the others gave the congratulatory message.
</li><li> When <em>DDR X</em> was released, it came with a new difficulty scale, and a difficulty meter with 10 blocks. Difficulties 1-10 are represented with yellow blocks in the meter, and difficulties 11 and higher have a doubled-up meter with red blocks each representing one level over 10 overlapping the yellow blocks (for example, a level 15 chart would have 5 red blocks and 5 yellow blocks). This implies that the then-new scale goes up to level 20; however, at the time, the highest difficulty any chart got was an 18, and the highest difficulty rating given to a song since is 19. Whether there will ever be a chart rated 20 remains to be seen.

Speculation ran wild about what it was supposed to do, ranging from sending hidden data to Harmonix's servers to tightening the timing window down to zero.

The problem is, there was one statement that persisted no matter what you did: "One of you is close to someone who needs help. Find this person, fast." This was a translation error; in the Japanese version, Gaspar simply told the party to speak to its members at the End of Time in order to learn about events or sidequests in their respective eras, and later translations made it clearer that he wasn't talking about another quest.

It only serves as flavor and a tease, since the weapons don't exist in-game.
</li><li> The very first "cave" area you enter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverOasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverOasis">Ever Oasis</a>,</em> the Horned Cave, has a very conspicuously cracked wall hidden behind a few mining points. To make it more obvious, bomb fruits <em>also</em> spawn in the cave, making you think that if you could just pick them up and carry them somehow, the wall would break. But you can't, and even the Hammer upgrade you get later, often used for breaking cracked things, does not affect it. Even the map says there's nothing there... it does nothing but look suspicious.

<ul><li> There is one more Esper slot than there are Espers. A lot of players took this to mean there was a hidden piece of Magicite somewhere out there that they'd overlooked. In reality, the empty slot was just there to allow the player to de-equip an Esper after obtaining all of them. Upon hearing the above explanation, some people <em>continued</em> to believe in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">nonexistent Esper</a>, insisting that they wouldn't need such a blank space because you have to lose Odin to obtain Raiden. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">It's there in case you cheat in all Espers</a>.

<ul><li> The 1/35 Soldiers and the Custom Sweepers items both <em>seem</em> to indicate they have some purpose at some point, but don't. For those wondering, 1/35 is the <em>scale</em> of the item, not a note that there's anything significant about having 35 of them ("Collect all 12!"). They still apply, though, as they're prominently hidden, are handed out as rare prizes, and are good for absolutely nothing whatsoever. Selling for one gil a pop, they don't even make worthwhile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>.
</li><li> One location on the path to the Forgotten City has a cave that can't be reached. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> ensued over what could be beyond that exit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">including a rumor that it's where you can resurrect Aerith.</a> A bit of texture map analysis shows that yes, there originally <em>was</em> supposed to be something up there, as there are layers on the background meant for you to walk behind the cave a small distance, but the path was removed and the cave goes nowhere.
</li><li> Not only is there no way to resurrect Aerith, there's also no way to get back the Holy materia she drops.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, examining a fountain in Lindblum yields the message "There's no place to insert the medal".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyType0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyType0">Final Fantasy Type-0</a></em> has ten Fire spells and their Blizzard equivalents, with nine of them having Thunder versions. Thunder-RFII does not exist.

<ul><li> The first game has a door just poking out of a lake. The player would assume that the lake would be drained and the door could be reached, but it never is.
</li><li> <em>The Lost Age</em> has a cellar in Mikasalla, where you can evaporate the water. Usually this leads to treasure or a secret room, but here, you get nothing. Another is Taopo Swamp; the locals tell you it's dried up, but you can't do anything about it. Finally, as you sail the boat along the coast of the continents, you can see towns from the first game, but you can't reach them. They look like you should be able to visit them, but even if you use a certain glitch to get across the mountains, you can't actually enter the towns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em>, the Mercury Lighthouse from the first game is visible while sailing the heroes' ship on the world map similar to the case from <em>The Lost Age</em>, but it cannot be accessed at all. In addition, the country of Bilibin, despite being mentioned often early on, is also never visited (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridge</a> in the second town and the closed border in the border town with Morgal both end up past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">points of no return</a>) even though the game gives the impression the heroes will travel through there to get to their destination of the country of Morgal (instead they are forced to take a detour through a completely different part of the continent to reach said destination).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3213f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3213f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3213f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Using a glitch or cheating device to get to the Mercury Lighthouse or Bilibin reveals that there is nothing there in the latter and that the former cannot be entered, and also reveals a non-functional Venus Lighthouse not visible during normal gameplay, also from the first game.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Gwen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> was originally this. She was a little girl who followed you around in the tutorial area, and would give you a tapestry shred marked as a quest item if you gave her enough flowers. After the tutorial, the player never saw her again, nor found a use for the tapestry, even though one could meet her dead mother in the underworld or find items of hers scattered throughout the world. This was never intended to be expanded upon, but so many players demanded closure that Gwen was eventually reintroduced. She now has more backstory than any other character in the game, most of which the player gets to experience first-hand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has the infamous sunken chest item. It's a common item, definitely, and it IS used in conjunction with other items to make a spooky pirate skeleton. However, it still does have an annoyingly alluring "use" link and the text given when it's used almost gives a hint that it should be opened, but the damn thing just will. Not. Open. The game's designers love trolling the users about it, frequently claiming it's the longest-standing undiscovered secret in the game. The worst thing is, they may be telling the truth - or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">eventually add a use</a> - in which case it isn't this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightCrusader">Light Crusader</a></em>: Gloves, swords, and body armors are all in separate lines in your inventory. However, after finding every possible sword and armor, you find that the "glove" line has a gap right in the middle. That set of gauntlets was never placed in the game.
</li><li> The final room of the final dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em> has a doorframe in the north wall and is the only place in the game where such architecture exists. Rumors claimed that it would be open at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> or something, but it's just a sprite that calls attention to itself by standing out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, there are several areas of the Citadel that appear as if you should be able to enter them - you can see things like door-opening icons and the like - but they are blocked by locked doors, desks, etc. and at no point in the game (or any DLC) do you actually get the chance to enter them. One example is the area behind the security checkpoint in the cargo bay area where the refugees make camp.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a> 4 Ultimate</em>, Great Jaggi and Gendrome are the only large monsters that don't appear at all in G Rank (not even as DLC), while the related Velocidrome and Iodrome do; their infants (Jaggi, Jaggia and Genprey) appear as well despite this. Many players who enter G Rank for the first time have asked in websites and forums where those two monsters are, and are given either the traditional negative answer or a joking one. Great Jaggi, Monoblos and White Monoblos are also the only large monsters outside the category of Variants, Elder Dragons and Rare Species that don't have any appearance under the Frenzy Virus effect; this too had unsuspecting players searching for them with no success.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a>, the online site, has an odd example. There is a Game called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeoQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeoQuest">NeoQuest</a> that you can play. In that game, there is a door that is locked. It has been 10 years since the game was released, yet no key has been found. The Neopets team that runs the site has made numerous jokes about people being unable to find it, yet these jokes cause users to believe that there is no key and/or it was forgotten.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, you can find NPCs around the world to occupy buildings and plots of land in your keep. You have two farms, but there is only one recruitable farmer; the second farm stays unoccupied. In addition, when you do recruit the farmer, he always says that the farm is in a poor condition, but unlike everything else in the keep, there is no way to improve the situation. Farms don't even have any gameplay effect, so apparently the developers never got to implementing them properly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> has a blinking eye that appears mysteriously at the status screen of a party member after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5">maxing his/her Social Link</a>. Apparently, it does nothing, but considering the heavy emphasis of the game on finding out hidden truths, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">this hasn't stopped the fans</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PixelDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PixelDungeon">Pixel Dungeon</a></em>, each boss drops the key to a gate that is required to progress to the next section of Pixel Dungeon. The final boss does not drop a key, but there still exists a gate at the bottom of the dungeon that cannot be opened by normal means. Should the player hack a key in, he'll find that there is, in fact, one more floor in the dungeon, but it is completely devoid except for a single sign that says, "What are you doing here?!"

<ul><li> The infamous truck in Vermilion Port. In a game with sparse decoration, and where almost nothing else—not even legendary species of Pokémon—has a unique overworld sprite, there is exactly one truck that, unless you get creative, you can't get to or even see! Many theories surrounded the truck, the most popular being that it was the method to accessing Mew. In reality? It does absolutely nothing, but the Gen III remakes keep the truck there and put a hidden Lava Cookie at the location as a nod to the urban legend.
</li><li> There appears to be a pathway behind Bill's house that leads somewhere but is impossible to reach. Like the truck, this has been linked to one of the many myths of where Mew lurks, the belief being that it leads to "Bill's Secret Garden" where you can catch the Legendary.
</li><li> Two large patches of grass parallel to Route 1 are never accessible. This had many people guessing as to what could possibly appear in that grass.

<ul><li> The Unown Dex used an interface that places all caught Unown as symbols. After catching all 26 Unown, there seems to be a vacant spot at the end, which lead to rumors of a 27th Unown called the Unown King.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p6m0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p6m0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p6m0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later games would include a question mark and an exclamation point... but not a period or a comma. Or colon, semicolon, quotation mark... you get the idea.</span>
</li><li> There were also rumors about being able to get the GS Ball and catch Celebi in non-Japanese versions of <em>Crystal</em>, fueled by the fact that the Celebi event was fully translated and still functional. No such thing is possible; hacking is the only way of accessing the event in international versions. The Virtual Console re-release of <em>Crystal</em>, however, allows you to acquire the GS Ball after defeating the Elite Four, making the translated event accessible for non-Japanese audiences.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>

They <em>do</em> get one in <em>Emerald</em>, though, but <em>not</em> in the Remakes.
</li><li> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>, to implement a feature from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>, have a room on one of the Islands with a box blocking a doorway. In the Japanese versions, scanning a battle card for the e-Reader would unblock the door leading to a battle with the Trainer the card is for. However, international releases of everything past <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em> (including their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, <em>Emerald</em>) removed e-Reader functionality due to poor sales in North America and a lack of a European release, but oddly enough the door is still there and due to the removal of the e-Reader features it is always blocked. Interacting with it says that there's wind blowing from behind it, but that's all.
</li><li> Then there's Altering Cave in <em>FireRed</em>, <em>LeafGreen</em>, and <em>Emerald</em>. Normally it only contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Zubat</a>, but the game's code reveals that several other Pokémon, mostly ones from Johto that can't be obtained in <em>FRLG</em> normally, can be found there. Turns out there were supposed to be live Mystery Gift events to change the Pokémon there... which was never held, <em>not even in Japan</em>! And given that the game itself frequently alludes to the mysterious nature of the cave and... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">you get the idea.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The demo that plays after waiting on the title screen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em> shows the "Card e room" which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> in international versions due to the failure of the e-Reader outside Japan. In the Japanese version, players could access it via the left door in the Phenac Stadium lobby after completing the main story, where they could battle VR Trainers by scanning Battle e cards. In international versions, both doors in the lobby lead to the battle area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Backlot's mansion consists of a hallway with doors to five rooms and the back garden (which is the only important part anyway). At each end of the hallway, there's a door blocked by a maid who says that the rest of the mansion is private and off limits. They never leave or let you through. The reason for this is probably to demonstrate that the mansion (which does look like a mansion from outside) consists of more than five rooms. Also, one of the rooms contains a statue that you're not allowed to touch. The security guard who won't let you in front of it works 23 hours a day. If you go there between 5 AM and 6 AM, you can touch the statue, but there's still no point in doing so.
</li><li> The Azure Flute, an event item that remains the only way for players to legitimately battle and catch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Arceus</a> in the wild, was <em>never</em> distributed, not even in Japan. (While Arceus itself was distributed several times, it was given directly, without the need to catch it.) This sadly renders Arceus' battle theme a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene">Long Song, Short Scene</a> situation in <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, which has a sidequest involving it and the main legendary trio from <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>.
</li><li> Similarly, <em>HeartGold</em> <em>SoulSilver</em> had the Lock Capsule (containing the TM Snarl), which is even more notable since it would have required a quest <em>spanning two games of different generations</em> to unlock, and the NPC who opens it keeps insisting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">he'll be seeing you later</a>. To add insult to injury, the sequels simply give the player the TM directly, rendering the Capsule completely useless even if it was released.

<ul><li> A post-game area known as Challenger's Cave is said to have a legend associated with it of a Legendary Pokémon and its student. This seems to indicate a connection with the Musketeer Trio and Keldeo, but none of the events involving them have anything to do with Challenger's Cave, and as the area is removed from the sequels, it's unlikely there will be any follow-up on this. In addition, Keldeo doesn't seem to be involved at all because the sequels in question added a location where Keldeo changes into its Resolute Forme with the assistance of the Musketeer Trio, with said location being located near a completely new town, far from where Challenger's Cave was.
</li><li> The story of Gen V talks a lot about how Zekrom and Reshiram were once a single, powerful Dragon-type Pokémon that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">split itself into two entities</a>. There's also Kyurem, a weak-looking husk that is revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> to have also been made by that fission, and can absorb either of its brethren to become stronger. However, it can <em>only</em> absorb one at a time; there's no way to completely restore the "Original Dragon" or otherwise imbue Kyurem with its full strength.

<ul><li> After beating the main story, two NPCs in Lumiose City change their conversation. One of them mentions that she heard there was a Lava Dome Pokémon in Jaune Plaza (where the NPCs are located). What Heatran (which isn't available in these games, but rather in <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>) has to do with that place is unknown, and bringing Heatran there does nothing anyway.
</li><li> The Kalos Power Plant has several locked doors which can't be entered. Many have speculated that a non-existent "Pokémon Z" would have made them accessible, or even connected them to the Mythical Pokémon Volcanion in some way, but as it stands, they serve no purpose other than to be there.

Turns out that monsters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> drop weapon orbs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops">randomly</a>, and this is the only way to get the axe and glove up to level 8. Then it does it <em>again</em>: Using those final dungeon random drops, it's possible to bring any weapon to level <strong>9</strong> (despite most of the game revolving around the number eight)... except the sword, because no monster randomly drops a Sword Orb. The ninth level sword is actually the fully powered Mana Sword, which can only legitimately be attained by casting <em>two different</em> temporary buffs on an eighth level sword. (And it's the only weapon that can defeat the final boss, naturally.)
</li><li> This game could also cause a lot of frustration for players because each spell caster could only get seven kinds of magic.

Three of them lead to different locations that you will traverse, but the fourth is inaccessible, leading to the Kingdom of Greeton. This region can never be accessed at any point in the game or post-game, and the gate serves only to note that yes, the kingdom does exist in a different part of Elicoor.

</li><li> A second, lesser instance is in the "Compounding" item creation method, in which you combine two herbal items in order to create new and better medicines.

<ul><li> The game houses a secret level called the Spacestation (whose only playable area is Abandoned Wreck), which tasks players with descending through its charred husk to the floors below. At the final deck, you'll find a mysterious door that slides open to reveal a thin alcove and nothing more. Keep in mind, an entire floor is dedicated to this grand reveal, which seems rather underwhelming when the door offers up little more than a bit of closet space. The developers later stated that "[The Abandoned Space Station] was one of the first levels we prototyped. We abandoned it, then put it back in late on as a hidden level."
</li><li> All three playable characters can separately collect all five types of key (red, yellow, green, blue and magenta), except for the blue key for Lupus. At least he won't require it at all during his errands.

Not in stage 3, stage 6, stage 9, or stage 10. Many people believe it may have been an outtake audio file they never removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> has a few of these:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">first game</a>, after you've done all the side missions, there still is an empty slot in the Items menu. That slot is there to hold the Raritanium, an item used for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a>, until you turn it in, after which it is removed from the menu, leading to some confusion. You can, however, fill the slot again in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> by picking up the Raritanium again and not turning it in.
</li><li> Also in the original game, you can upgrade ten of your weapons in the two Gold Weapon Rooms... leaving the other five weapons in their vanilla forms. More than a few players assumed those could be upgraded as well, since five of the full ten could be acquired through the second Gold Weapon Room, so there must be a <em>third</em> for the rest of the weapons, right?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em> allows weapons to level up, and then in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a>, they can go to Mega and then Ultra... but not <em>all</em> weapons can do that.

</li><li> A more classic example is the empty slot in <em>Going Commando's</em> Item menu. This was probably the spot for the Hydro-Pack upgrade that fires torpedoes, which was likely cut as the game didn't feature any underwater combat in its downplayed swimming sections.
</li><li> The RYNOCIRATOR in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em> is the only weapon that peaks at level 5 instead of level 8.

Time Bombs don't level up at all, so the level number is just misleading.
</li><li> On the Deplanetizer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)</a></em>, there are a bunch of locked doors with red padlock icons on them. You'd think that since the game is so up-front about how these doors are locked, there's some way to open them, right? After all, other doors in the game that can't be opened don't have a giant lock icon on them, so there must be something special about these padlock-sign doors, right? Wrong. There is nothing special about any of those doors, despite the giant lock icon on them. Even worse is that there are hidden switches behind a few of the door frames in this level; they're the green switches that turn red when hit with a wrench or other kind of weapon fire (though any you find will already be red and look to be activated). Aiming a weapon at these switches shows a reticle over them, as though they were functional. On top of that, in the room with the small elevator (that you originally have to ride while wearing the Hologuise) there are three doors to leave the room; one is in the center and takes you to the elevator that leads to the rest of the level, one is on the left which is locked and looks like all the others in the level, and an open one is on the right, and behind it is... another locked door. All of these strangely placed objects seem to imply that something is hidden, which is all backed up by the existence of the "Et, tu Copernicus?" trophy, which specifically tells you to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find Captain Qwark's room in the base</span>. Though there is some hidden dialogue to be found, such a room is never <em>actually</em> found inside of the game.
</li><li> There's also another one in <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank '16</em>; when you have all of the Holocards, Raritanium drops are increased by 35% total, but Holocard and bolt drops are only increased by 30%.
</li></ul></li><li> There are various buildings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>'s Inkopolis Plaza hub area that are used for various purposes and serve as a way to go to the game's modes, but there are a couple of buildings that remain unused, as well as a walled-off train station just behind the starting area. Inkopolis Square in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> takes it up further: not only are there locked-off pathways with stairs leading somewhere, some of them actually get used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> modes, most notably the stairs leading down into a subway station becoming access to Octo Expansion. The rest of them, however, are permanently inaccessible. Also in Inkopolis Square is a coffee shop where Spyke from the first game hangs out, who appears to be researching something on a laptop. He was a fairly important character in the first game, so it's jarring that you can't get in the coffee shop nor does Spyke interact with you except to glance over in your direction every now and then. You also can't see what he's researching.

<ul><li> The schematics for the Rock-It Launcher from <em>Fallout 3</em> could originally be found in the Nellis hangar, but it could not be crafted even if you had all the components. A patch removed the schematics.
</li><li> The flight simulator VR pods in the mess hall of Nellis Air Force Base cannot be used. When interacted with, a message says they require a code to operate. If you ask Loyal if you can use them, he says they're for the Boomers' use only, no matter how high your reputation is with them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Mountain Resort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoVacation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoVacation">Go Vacation</a>,</em> there's a heart-shaped island in the lake. Several nearby NPCs talk it up, which is usually an indicator that the island is involved in a secret. One even says that couples who vow their love on the island later get married, which has caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">some people to think</a> you can get married in the game. But the island doesn't seem to do anything and you can't get married. It appears to just be there for flavor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> has the chiliad mural, which some people try to connect anything they can, even when there is nothing to link. However, there are a few unexplained things. Once you reach 100%, you can find a few UFOs floating on the sky, and since they are invisible until close enough, not all might have been found. One of them (above fort Zancudo) shines a light into a bunker below. The bunker is unique, and has an unusable elevator inside it. The strange thing is that you can force its doors open via a glitch, but it leads nowhere. People have spent years trying to unlock its doors legimately and find a trigger to start the elevator, but without any results.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> has a row of locked doors inside the Daily Bugle. The curious thing is that walking to them plays the "door locked" sound effect, that normally only plays when you try to enter a story location early (or after the mission) or when a shop is closed during nighttime.
</li><li> The yellow marble in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Riven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Riven">Riven</a></em>'s fire marble dome puzzle does nothing but throw you off, there is no hidden sixth island.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> has two major ones.
<ul><li> The missing princess is the most well known, as the Roanoke Ridge area has several references to her. She has a character model and the scripting still includes bits of this quest (but not how to trigger it, unfortunately), but as of february 2020 no-one's been able to locate her in-game - many fans assume she was simply cut from the game, and the clues weren't removed to keep players searching for her.
</li><li> The player can find 2 meteorite fragments in Roanoke Ridge, but their description always says "X out of 3". If the satchel is upgraded the max number of these fragments stays at 3, so it's not the default item count cap either. Some sources claim finding all three would increase the player's tolerance to cold weather, but no evidence of this has been found in the game's code. An easy glitch allows the player to obtain 3 by picking the 2 up and wating for them to respawn in the epilogue, but (at least when done this way) players have not received any bonuses.

One hut in Onu-Koro isn't locked, however, but you still can't go in. As revealed by some unused game files, this place was to be home of a smith of some sort, but it has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>.

<ul><li> A probable urban-legend college prank involves releasing three piglets (or chickens, or whatever) with the numbers "1", "2", and "4" painted on their sides. The pranked quickly find all the animals, but continue searching for the non-existent one marked "3".
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsWithAndy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsWithAndy">What's with Andy?</a></em>, Andy Larkin pulled this prank once. He did also a variation of it... with about <em>one hundred</em> sheep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheGreatAlicornHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheGreatAlicornHunt">The Great Alicorn Hunt</a></em> has Scootaloo mention that Rainbow Dash once pulled the same prank in Ponyville Town Hall with a set of four piglets (marked 1, 2, 3 and 5). As a result, poor Mayor Mare spent the whole day going out of her mind trying to find a non-existent pig marked "4".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the very first set, Alpha, the cards Volcanic Island and Circle of Protection: Black weren't printed due to an error, which meant there was a Circle of Protection for each color but black and a dual land for each two-color combination but blue/red. This was fixed in the next set, Beta.
</li><li> The head designer, Mark Rosewater, has mentioned that he deliberately tries to avoid upsetting player expectations, but sometimes he either doesn't notice a pattern or is overruled. In the case of <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=142363">Goatnapper,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which temporarily steals a goat, the card was supposed to be a sly reference to the changelings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9bryw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9bryw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9bryw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Changelings count as any type of creature, including goats.</span> Cue angry letters from fans asking why there weren't any goat cards. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207864">Tower of Calamities<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was printed about a decade after the four Mirrodin towers just so people would stop asking where the fifth tower was.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> Campaign Setting had several of these. Comparable creatures could often be found on each Inner or each Outer Plane, but there were some gaps. For instance, there were mephits on each Inner Plane except the energy planes, except that there was no Vacuum mephit, and Steam had both Steam and Mist mephits. This led to in-universe (or in-multiverse) rumors that there were Inner Planes that were either hidden or lost, and that there had once been a race of Void mephits that had been wiped out. A later sourcebook actually referenced in passing a unique creature that might have been the last void mephit.
</li><li> The standard edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ACDC">AC/DC</a> Pinball</em> has a large portrait of Angus Young in the middle, with the electronics to light up his eyes, his mouth, and for some reason, his nose. Despite it having the most official code updates of any pinball machine, none of these lights are ever used in normal gameplay, though they do flash in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">Attract Mode</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Trading Card Game</em>, during the Neo series of sets, spread throughout them were various Unown cards, one for each letter... except "R". As it turns out, there <em>was</em> an Unown R card made around that time, but it was a promo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">that was only released in Japan</a>, thus making Unown R's conspicuous absence in those line of sets apparent.
</li><li> Most likely an intentional example in the pinball machine for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>: In the left outlane (a path that leads to a drain, ending the ball) is a light that reads "Not Special" and a sensor switch right next to it. Not Special is the most seldomly lit light in the game (though, unlike with Angus, it does happen), and because of its location, players wouldn't want to willingly send the ball down there. What does Not Special do? Appropriately, absolutely nothing. The consensus of fans is that Not Special was originally something else but was removed or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> late in production (no one has found anything in the code that would correspond to any theoretical effects of Not Special), after the holes in the playfield to install the lights were already finalized.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Westworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Westworld">Westworld</a></em>. This is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> the Man in Black is searching for in Season One. He's convinced the designer of Westworld put in a secret level known as the Maze. Turns out the Maze is actually for the androids to gain full self-awareness, though the Man in Black isn't disappointed as that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction">just makes the game more interesting again.</a>
