<ul><li> During the endgame of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>, Tetsuo's powers become exceedingly unstable and his body mutates and expands. It attempts to crush everyone near it, but at that point Tetsuo doesn't really have any control over his massively-expanding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>. The psychics then teleport main character Kaneda away from the mass of flesh and proceed to blow it up.
</li><li> This trope occurs several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ggio Vega has a "battle form" outside of his normal Resurreccion that apparently massively boosts his strength and durability. The problem? He seemingly sacrifices his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> in exchange, which is a <em>major</em> problem when facing off against a foe (Soifon) who's not only incredibly fast herself, but also has a Shikai that lets her deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">an instant kill with two strikes to the same place</a> regardless of overall durability. Where before he was able to put her on the ropes at several points (admittedly because she held back to gauge his ability), he lets her goading get to him to trigger the transformation. She proceeds to blitz and fatally injure him before he realizes what happened, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">can only listen in mounting horror as she explains what she just did before he bites it</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaname Tousen</span>, after revealing he has been made a Visored, says that he has a <em>Resurreccion</em> to go along with it. He turns into an insectoid monster, with new, gigantic eyes. As he's about to finish off Komamura, Hisagi sneaks up on him and stabs him through the head. Hisagi claims that if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tousen</span> hadn't been distracted by his new form, he would have easily sensed the attack and dodged it. Yes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">a blind man gained sight, only to be defeated by an attack he would have seen coming otherwise</a>.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yammy</span>, despite his Resurreccion transforming him into the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Cero Espada"</span>; databooks explain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yammy</span>'s only power is he gets bigger and increases his reiatsu as his rage builds; the first and second Espada are considerably more powerful than the average captain, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yammy</span>'s special ability only makes him a gigantic target <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Kenpachi and Byakuya easily defeat offscreen</span>.
</li><li> Aizen falls prey to this, as well. While his final series of transformations certainly increase his already-impressive abilities dramatically, his zanpakutou's ability to control opponent's perceptions was what let him curbstomp his opponents so effortlessly. He loses that ability as he transforms (or rather, he still had it, he just grew so arrogant that he decided he didn't <em>need</em> to use it anymore), forced to fight without strategy or deception, ultimately making him a surmountable obstacle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vamdemon/Myotismon goes through this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, dying to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">kids shouting out what they want to be when they grow up</a></em> (though this makes sense, considering that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">constructed his new body out of those kids' fear and despair</a>), followed up by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> blast to whatever's left.
</li><li> Etemon in the same series qualifies as well, he goes from "invincible, and needing to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a> and directly attacked" to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">throw a hammer at me</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastBreathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastBreathBullet">sucker punch</a> and I'll disintegrate".
<ul><li> The Mega level also count as this, Devimon and the Ultimate forms of Etemon and Myotismon took forever to defeat, while all 7 Mega-Level forms they faced got curb-stomped.
</li><li> Justified in that the kids were much stronger at the end of the series and the stronger Digimon came right out to fight instead of sending in their minions, and as a result were killed much quicker.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> During their big fight in the original series, Piccolo assumes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">Great Namek form</a> to fight Goku, only to end up losing. While it <em>does</em> increase his strength and durability quite a bit, according to Goku, the form doesn't actually increase Piccolo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Power Level</a> and essentially just makes him a bigger target.
</li><li> Good guy version: Future Trunks thought he had surpassed his father by going Ultra Super Saiyan — until he tries to use it in a fight with Cell in the Android Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Sure, he's big and strong, but the bulky muscles make him significantly slower and he immediately loses. Vegeta may or may not have achieved the same form during training, but clearly realized <em>immediately</em> the drawback and in combat limited himself at the less bulky Ascended Super Saiyan form, while Goku, who achieved both, decided that even Ascended Super Saiyan was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeYetImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeYetImpractical">Awesome, yet Impractical</a> due the greater <em>ki</em> consumption and focused on mastering the basic Super Saiyan form, the end result being stronger than ASSJ and less power consuming.
</li><li> Ironically, Cell later makes the exact same mistake against Gohan, out of rage at being completely overpowered.
</li><li> Happens to Frieza as well. After Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan in the Namek Saga of <em>Z</em>, Frieza can barely even hurt Goku with only 50% of his power, let alone kill him. Goku gives Frieza enough time to reach his full power, at which point he is Goku's equal for a short time (though Goku was holding back to test Frieza and avoid causing too much damage while the others were still on the planet). However, staying in that form burns up his energy at an accelerated rate. Because Frieza's already burnt so much energy from the arc-long fighting (as well as losing emotional stability at that level of power), Goku's greater stamina wins out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBioBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBioBroly">Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly</a></em>, Broly's clone is turned into something akin to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> due to a culture fluid, and despite this, he remains as much of a killing machine as before. However, he melts in the culture fluid and it seems he's dead. That is, until Goten, Trunks, and Krillin watch in horror as he arises as a gargantuan monster larger than a mountain and looks as if he could destroy the world many times over by simply breathing. Instead of an epic clash, he gets wet and is killed by the water. The heroes have no problem taking him out from there.
</li><li> At the end of the Buu Saga of <em>Z</em>, Goku and Vegeta remove Buu's absorbed victims and he reverts back to his original form, Kid Buu. He's weaker than Fusion Super Buu (Buu after he absorbed Gohan, Gotenks, and Piccolo). Regardless, he is still a major threat because Gohan and Gotenks were knocked out when Kid Buu blew up the Earth, leaving only Goku and Vegeta alive to fight him.
<ul><li> While how much Kid Buu is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel">Clipped-Wing Angel</a> is still debated within the <em>Dragon Ball</em> fandom, since the manga leaves it vague how strong Kid Buu is to the other Buu forms, the general consensus is that even if Kid Buu may not be the <em>strongest</em> form of Buu, it's agreed by everyone that he is the <em>most dangerous.</em> Fat Buu was like a naughty child and Super Buu was like a hotheaded warrior, but they could be reasoned with to various degrees. Kid Buu, though, is <em>absolutely insane,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">living only for cosmic destruction,</a> to the point that the very first thing he did was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">blow up the planet for no reason.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Frieza's new transformation, Golden Frieza, is this. In this form, he overpowers post <em>Battle of Gods</em> Goku, but he has the same stamina issues as his original 100% form. Meaning, after only a short time, Goku regains his advantage and beats Frieza senseless.</span> In <em>Super</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he manages to completely master it, however.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Future Zamasu decides to stop playing around and fuses with Goku Black using the Potara Earrings to become the all-mighty Merged Zamasu, with Goku and Vegeta one-upping that to bring back Vegito. As they fight, while they're mostly evenly-matched at first, Merged Zamasu's body starts falling apart because the mortal form of Goku Black compromised the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> of Future Zamasu, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> and leaving Merged Zamasu in a position in which he could <em>actually</em> be killed, which was the main problem the heroes faced earlier on against Zamasu.

</li><li> The first battle between Inu-Yasha and his full yokai half-brother Sesshomaru when he transforms into his true form (a giant demonic dog). Rather than rely on his tact, sword-fighting prowess, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">Dissonant Serenity</a> in human form, the transformed Sesshomaru is much more blunt; he growls, stomps, and bites like a dumb beast, including leaping headfirst into Inu-Yasha's transformed blade, which destroys his left arm. Sesshomaru learns his lesson not to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> on his opponents unless absolutely necessary, as his true form is seldom seen after that. This is later confirmed to be exactly why he seldom takes that form. He gains a massive increase to his raw physical power, but in turn looses access to the majority of the techniques and powers he had in his human form and unless he's REALLY focused, his mind regresses to the point that he becomes nothing more than a giant dog incapable of strategy or higher thought.

But at the same time, Inuyasha can not use the power of his sword against him because Bankotsu is a human and not a demon. However, when Bankotsu reinforces his sword, he suddenly creates a Demon Aura so that Inuyasha can defeat him.

Some of this has to do with the fact that Nanoha was forced to fight the Book all on her own, whereas after the transformation, everyone was present to smash it. But a good deal of the reason was because Hayate had removed the Will of the Book of Darkness (whom she named Reinforce), leaving the corrupted (and far less intelligent) Defense Program to fend for itself. The Defense Program reformatted the body into an enormous monster, but that only made it a larger target that everyone could freely attack without getting in each other's way, which was one of the major difficulties in fighting the original humanoid form. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">With the support mages binding the monster and interrupting its attacks, all of the heavy-hitters had the time to set up their biggest attacks.</a>

By absorbing said shadows into his body, he gains the strength and skill of the ones whose shadows he took. The average person can handle about two or three shadows without passing out, while Luffy, with his insane willpower, was capable of handling 100. Moria's Shadows Asgard was the result of him absorbing 1000 shadows, which was too much even for him to handle for very long. Also, he had stolen the shadows of four of the top five fighters of the Straw Hats with his powers, and if someone without a shadow is struck by sunlight, their body will disintegrate.</span></em>

Koscheij becomes huge and monstrous, but the power quickly gives out, leaving him weak and feeble once again.

Essentially, the main distinction Absorbing Man has regarding this trope is that he uses a different Clipped-Wing Angel form each time.
<ul><li> He can match almost anyone, power-wise (he's repeatedly fought the Hulk and proven a challenge), but due to impulsiveness, carelessness, surprise, or just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">idiocy</a>, has to absorb something that just won't help and gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>. For instance, fighting the Hulk at a construction site. The building collapses, and he reaches for some rubble so he can become as sturdy as steel or concrete... and grabs a glass shard. You can guess the rest.

Cue explosion.
</li><li> And then there was the first time he became water, and went insane when he blended in with the ocean. He has since learned how to control himself in liquid form, however.
</li><li> Daredevil once defeated the Absorbing Man by tricking him into mimicking diamond and then using his enhanced senses to strike the weak point on his enemy's body.
</li><li> He once went up against Spider-Man, who you probably wouldn't think could take him solo. The webhead does, by tricking him into absorbing one chemical, and then burying him in another that reacts with it explosively. The kaboom was quite spectacular, though of course the Absorbing Man is capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingHimselfTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingHimselfTogether">Pulling Himself Together</a>... eventually.

Admittedly, had he not enacted this plan, he would presumably have remained a destructible human, so it's still an improvement.

At the end of the episode, the demon does appear with much shaking and spooky light... only to turn out to be smaller than your hand. Buffy defeats it by stepping on it.

Still, it was better than anyone else, <em>even Buffy herself</em>, had done against Glory up to that point.
</li></ul></li><li> The early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows loved playing this trope with the Great Leader, the recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the show.
<ul><li> At the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider">original series</a>, Rider 1 encounters the Great Leader and rips his hood off, revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a bunch of tentacles</span>.

So technically, Great Leader undergoes not one but TWO Clipped Wing Angel forms without actually fighting the hero at all!

Other characters later fall into the same trap with more impressive powerups: Brave's <em>Taddle Fantasy</em> form gives him a heart attack if tries to actually use any of its magical abilities, Taiga's two brute-force attempts to use <em>Kamen Rider Chronicle</em> both end in him being overwhelmed by the strain before he can actually finish off his opponent, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> achieves a gigantic monstrous form that's easily dispatched by the pitifully weak Level 1 Riders.

The power increase thus doesn't make any real difference, and the form introduces a security exploit that the heroes can use to suck <em>all</em> of his power away, with the actual fight being nothing but a ploy to buy time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZeroOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZeroOne">Kamen Rider Zero-One</a></em> has a jarring one with Kamen Rider Orthoros Vulcan: the form may be fast and strong enough to eventually bypass Zero-Two's predictions, but puts a heavy strain on the user and is not stable at all, to the point all that Vulcan was able to achieve was a single successful hit before the driver exploded and he was forced out of transformation.

Additionally, he loses his 100% resistance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">light magic</a>, finally allowing Raine and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">Colette</a> to do some serious damage (especially if you use Stardust Rain with Genis).

Then, after being beaten, he seemingly kicks the bucket; however, as Dante attempts to escape the crumbling castle, Mundus rises again; the statuesque facade he had used to fight you earlier is crumbling, revealing a grotesque blob of flesh and eyeballs. It's actually a lot easier to beat this form than when he was standing waist deep in lava. Additionally, in the first two battles, Dante stood a chance only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">the Sparda sword's full power was finally unlocked</a>; it was the only sword you could use against Mundus.

<ul><li> The game has Kael'Thas's second encounter. While he definitely looks more intimidating due to the way a demon saved his life, he's a far shot from his former self, who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">several servants</a>, animated weapons, and a very impressive event heralding the last stage of the fight. Instead, he only goes through the last two stages again, the second of which was weakened so much that any single class with self-healing capacities can finish him off. He also went from a 25-man raid down to five people, but even for that, he's not particularly impressive compared to the rest of the dungeon he was in. People were more likely to have troubles with the last pack of regular enemies. The reason is because Kael'Thas hasn't gotten any stronger due to the demon's interference, it was just a matter of making it out of his defeat alive. The crystal in his chest is preserving his life. You're fighting a guy <em>on life support.</em>
</li><li> While less dramatic, High Astromancer Solarian's fight. The first phase involves her casting deadly arcane spells and summoning adds galore. Upon hitting 20% health, she seems to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> by transforming into an immense Void Walker demon... but the encounter actually turns into a Tank-And-Spank fight and can be won with merely a handful of raid members alive.
</li><li> Lei Shen in the Throne of Thunder raid is a long, intense fight requiring perfect positioning, kiting, and splitting up the party in just such a way. After the second transition phase at about 25% health however, Lei Shen suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a>, no longer harnesses the sectors of his platform that were such a threat, and the only new mechanic is wind that can blow players to their death but you'd have to be ignoring entirely to die to, making it more of a victory lap unless your raid is low on surviving members.
</li><li> Xavius in The Emerald Nightmare raid, as opposed to his form in the Darkheart Thicket five-man dungeon. He looks like he's on steroids, but he hits like a wet noodle. The setting is hella creepy with creatures coming at you out of the mist and stuff: but the actual fight is super easy. In the five-man instance he was actually fairly difficult (given the difference in group size): but that was just a magical simulacrum. While The Emerald Nightmare isn't the first time <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoW">Wo W</a> has had a penultimate boss that was way harder than the final one: it has become infamous for just how exaggerated the difference was.

While you're still in a 50-foot mecha. Even then, he is able to take so much more bullets than any other human opponent in the game that is looks like he's cyborgized beyond humanity — he doesn't <em>bleed</em> the way humans do. Even when you're on your mecha, you'll have to step on him <em>several times</em> to kill him for good.

He's a lot like Axel, with his fast, varied, hard to predict attacks, and the ability to easily punish you for any mistakes. Then he hops into some kind of flower mecha, loses all his good attacks, and just becomes a tedious, easy to handle boss who always gives you time to heal. Ansem in Riku's mode seems like this when you fight him in the middle, but in the GBA version when you get to the end you'll find he is a worthy final boss.... however, the PS2 remake made it much easier to dodge and block his attacks. In the PS2 remake, Marluxia has a 3rd form, which just sits still and takes only a handful of Keyblade slashes to take down each health bar. The trick? He has several powerful gimmicks, such as making you drop all of your attacks, shooting you with a laser attack that will hit about a dozen times if it connects right away, or casting Doom on you. Also, nearly all of his attacks are Sleights, meaning if you don't have the right cards, you'll be left desperately trying to dodge them.

Then you fight him again, he's fast, has loads of incredibly powerful attacks (a long, devastating combo, and METEOR SHOWER (not the Shotlock, but a variation of Meteor instead) which is an auto gameover if you don't have the right abilities, a ridiculous amount of health, and the ability to easily kill you if you screw up. Then in the epilogue, you fight that version again before he changes form, gaining even more health!.... and trading Meteor Shower and a lot of his more annoying moves for a bunch of slow, easy-to-dodge attacks, and going from constantly pressuring you to always giving you enough time to heal. His one attack that is actually somewhat threatening is mitigated by the fact that whenever it's used, it presents the opportunity to pull off a reaction command that will cause a massive amount of damage if you succeed at it.

This can become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> when you realize that Sonic is usually in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> for the final battle. One of the most infamous in Sonic lore to date is the final boss in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles">Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</a> where, despite the fact that the previous battles have you nearly drowning, incapable of using POW attacks, and even fighting with only one character, the final battle against Lord Ix can be done in twelve seconds if you can match every combo on the touch screen. What makes it even more ridiculous is that the touch screen commands are arguably easier to follow than most Mook characters' attacks.
</li><li> Giygas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">wasn't nearly so monstrous</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em>, being an angry little alien creature in a life support capsule who wanted to punish humanity for stealing the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psionics/PSI</a>. However, after being reminded of his love for his human foster parents, George and Maria, Giygas' intense hatred and his unstable mental state from that little reminder eventually destroyed him in body and mind. As a result, Giygas was reduced to what could only be described as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot">Almighty Idiot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">made of evil and madness itself</a>, taking the form of a swirling, dark-red mass with a distorted face screaming in agony. In this terrifying form, Giygas is incomprehensibly powerful and impossible to defeat through conventional means (it ultimately takes prayer to destroy him, since he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">Made of Evil</a> after all), but he has no more capability of sustaining his mental functions, and can no longer perceive the world around him. In fact, all throughout the final battle with him, he rants incoherently while firing off inexplicably powerful attacks, most likely not knowing what's there (though he does acknowledge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the main hero, Ness,</a> by name. Giygas needs a special "Devil's Machine" to help him keep his mental state and form coherent, as outside of it, he is mindless and irrational, and capable of destroying the entire cosmos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">while absolutely oblivious as to what he's doing</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some people even believe that this nigh-unstoppable horror is being manipulated by the cowardly fat kid who created the Devil's Machine for him: Pokey Minch.</span>
<ul><li> Speaking of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said cowardly fat kid</span>, he also subverts this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Pokey</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">(or Porky)</a> goes through a One-Winged Angel phase first, appearing first as a normal chubby boy, and second as a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">feeble yet immortal old man inside a huge mechanical spider</span>. But at some critical point during the final battle, Porky seals himself inside an "Absolutely Safe Capsule". While inside, he can't do any damage to the protagonists — or anyone, for that matter. However, he's invincible in this form — but, in a way, he's "defeated" at that point, because said capsule is inescapable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">meaning he's stuck inside forever</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Knight-Commander Meredith</span>, does this. After fighting her in one form, she attempts to draw more power <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactofDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactofDoom">Red Lyrium Broadsword.</a></span> This works a few times, but upon defeat, she tries to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> use the sword to</span> harness even more power to get back on her feet. Ultimately, the sword shatters from the over-usage, and she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenforGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenforGranite">turned into a statue of Red Lyrium</a> from the backlash.
</li><li> Loewenzahn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03">P.N.03</a></em>, after its initial two forms are defeated the second time, transforms into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix">mecha-phoenix</a> as a last ditch effort. Its attacks can easily be dodged, and it goes down quickly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em>, after a normal battle, then a difficult and rather tedious airship battle against a giant silver...thing, Ramirez attacks you on the deck of your airship for one final battle, semi-transformed into a monster. However, it's easier than the previous two battles, and combined with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a>, it makes a for a fun beatdown. In addition, Ramirez has a rather amusing attack, Silver Nightmare, that forces one of your characters to use a technique against your party. More fun than it sounds, as it usually doesn't hurt them that much.
</li><li> A couple of units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries">Gundam Extreme Vs</a></em> will change into a "heavily-damaged" extra form upon being destroyed. This form only has 100 health and generally very few methods of attack, but it allows the player to try for a last-ditch attempt at defeating their enemy. This is a derivative of the Recover Awakening featured in <em>Gundam Vs Zeta Gundam</em>: if your Awakening meter is full when you or any of your allies take a hit that would be fatal, the subject is instantly restored to 25% health at the cost of one of its extremities and any weapons attached to the lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">limb</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">head</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom">binder</a>. However, enemies never use the Awakening system, so that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">another trope</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em>, after losing its cloak and drones, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Rebel Flagship</a> redirects power to its shields, teleporter, and 'some kind of superweapon'. The shield turns out to be a super-heavy Zoltan Shield, the teleporter is a two-man unit that only sends humans, and the superweapon is a barrage of eight or nine heavy lasers. Without the Halberd Beam, the Boarding Drone, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">Drone Swarm</a>, however, most players breeze right by it.
</li><li> The final form of the final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux">Dynamite Dux</a></em> is very tiny and can't attack — he just runs around real fast. Though he can take off a third of your health through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a>, this is nothing compared to his previous forms.
</li><li> Morgath of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AvencastRiseOfTheMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AvencastRiseOfTheMage">Avencast: Rise of the Mage</a></em> has a second form that gets full-on boss battle treatment, but it's literally his beating heart with almost no defenses whatsoever. Any player who can survive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">previous fight</a> will find it a cakewalk.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em> is the Master Core, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">doesn't appear on lower intensities</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss">replaces Master Hand and Crazy Hand mid-battle</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">has several forms, each more dangerous than the last</a>. Except for the <em>very</em> last form: a motionless orb that does nothing except wait for you to blast it offscreen. If you take <em>too</em> long to kill it, it'll unleash a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> energy waves, but if you dodge those it just self-destructs.
</li><li> While his second form is definitely worthy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2">Bayonetta 2</a></em>'s third form is this. Literally. After the previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> phases of the battle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the source of his power is removed by Loki and</span> he becomes unsteady, wobbling drunkenly, barely attacking, and even the angular "wings" on his back are shattered.
</li><li> Bosses rarely actually transform in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>, but some actually become easier after they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turn Red</a>, such as Pestilence spawning normal flies instead of chargers, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mom's Heart/It Lives</span> launching exploding projectiles all over the room, but no longer hiding in the rafters after spawning enemies so it can be killed faster.
</li><li> In the realistic version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ivo Shandor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">declares himself a god</a> and chooses a Destructor form. That form is...a giant stereotypical devil. The sorely underwhelmed Ghostbusters proceed to <em>thoroughly wipe the floor with him.</em> This is entirely in keeping with the rules of <em>Ghostbusters</em>: Gozer needed someone else to "choose and perish," knowing that someone would eventually hit upon something sufficiently horrifying. When Shandor chose his own form...well, let's just say that he probably chose too quickly.
</li><li> This can happen to the player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone">Nuclear Throne</a></em>. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Melting</a> is caught in a Necromancer's resurrection circle, he'll be resurrected too, after which you get the dubious honor of playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Skeleton</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>, Vay Hek will call down a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> from orbit when losing the battle, which he plugs his body into. While he's capable of dealing more damage while in the Terra Frame via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> and orbital strike drones, he loses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn">Mana Burn</a> attack and inexplicably has a <em>dramatic</em> reduction in armor. His normal form - well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">as normal as it can be</a> - can only be damaged by shooting his face while he has his mask open to taunt the Tenno, but the Terra Frame can be damaged anywhere and has far less damage mitigation.
</li><li> In <em>Heart of Ice</em>, The Watcher refuses to go down after his proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form, resulting in a final sword battle. While not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>, it's a much easier than any of the other boss battles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm">BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Soul of TORment first appears as some kind of immense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Dance Battling</a> skeleton/angel monstrosity, but when you finally exhaust its massive HP pool, it shrieks that its going to unleash its true form and turns into an onion. An onion with a smiley face that goes down in a single hit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It makes (slightly) more sense in context.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, Mettaton's heavy armor plating makes him completely invulnerable to your attacks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">humanoid Mettaton EX form</a> is easily damaged on top of having awful battery life. Justified in that while his original form was designed for killing humans (he even gloats that he retains those abilities) his EX form was purely meant to be the perfect entertainer, and that he's fully aware of this and chooses <em>not</em> to transform: you have to trick him into turning around so you can hit the switch and forcibly transform him into EX. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Genocide path</a> takes this even further with Mettaton NEO, who despite looking quite impressive and boasting of his human-killing capabilities not only goes down in a single hit like nearly every other enemy at this point, but is in fact incapable of harming you period.</span>

But by the time he gets enough seals unlocked to pose a significant threat, any other character (including fellow bottom-tier characters) will have already won the match. What makes it worse is that, since Central Fiction doesn't use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Unlimited Mode</a> from the previous games that could've made him a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> like it made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Hazama</a> so tough to fight in Continuum Shift, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss">that's all you get for the final battle</a>.

However, once he is defeated, he transforms into a Shade (the monsters who he created in his dungeon). In this form, he forsakes the ice magic for lighting spells and a fiery aura. Since he isnt using ice magic, hes much easier to defeat in this form.

Unfortunately, the laundry list of drawbacks - inability to wear <em>any</em> clothes, low damage output, alarmingly long charge times on attacks, and so on - mean that actually doing so will typically be followed swiftly by death.
<ul><li> Among the bosses, the very first one, Iudex Gundyr, turns into a horrible Abyssal goo dinosaur monster known as a Pus of Man in his second phase. While it is certainly large and scary, and is going to stay difficult for new players who are still figuring out the controls, the Pus form also has slower and more telegraphed attacks, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">is very vulnerable to fire</a> (and you can find firebombs just outside his boss arena).

This brings him down to the status of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, as he starts the battle with a massive self-buff that, for the first few turns, makes him pretty much invincible and allows him to wipe out your entire starting lineup in one shot. After you defeat him, he comes back once more, now on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Bishōnen Line</a> as the King of Men. In this form, he's decayed much further: his amazing self-buff is gone completely, he's lost a third of his HP, and his overall attacks aren't nearly as terrifying. Even he basically admits that he knows he's going to die, and he just wants to go out on his own terms.

<ul><li> It's generally agreed that Dracula's second form in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">the first game</a> is a lot easier than his first form.

</li><li> In pretty much every appearance of Death where he has two forms, the first form is the harder of the two. This is because the first form uses Death's classic tactic of floating around out of your reach throwing out tons of scythe projectiles, but the second tends to stay close to the ground and fight in melee, which is much easier to deal with.
