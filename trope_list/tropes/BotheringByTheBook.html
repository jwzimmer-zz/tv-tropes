Burton (Cary Elwes) keeps trying to report the deadly flaws in the Bradley Fighting Vehicle but is consistently thwarted by his superior, Maj. Gen. Partridge (Kelsey Grammer). After consulting the U.S. Army Book of Rules &amp; Regulations, Burton publishes a report detailing the vehicle's every flaw and sends it to Partridge. Partridge orders the report rewritten to make the Bradley seem perfect. Burton follows regulations and writes a memo on the rewrite and sends it to all 198 people involved in the project. Partridge is furious and wants Burton disciplined, but his underlings tell him that Burton followed regulations to the letter.

<ul><li> A Chilean folktale tells of a "roto" (kind of a country bumpkin) who sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for cash. When the Devil asks him when it should come pick up his soul, the roto tells him to do so the following day. Surprised, the Devil writes the agreement, saying that it'll take the soul "the next day". They meet daily for a while, the roto arguing that well, the contract says "next day", and that's tomorrow.

This takes several minutes for the entire combined computing power of the whole alliance fleet, and he wonders if it might crash their servers. Even if it didn't it would be functionally impossible to dig through the entire mess of information to find anything to use against him.

Another loophole in this oath was that the oathtaker promises to protect the subjects of his / her majesty, but doesn't say anything about defending the majesty themselves.
<ul><li> And in the main plot, Vimes uses this to rein in the Cable Street Particulars of the past (in his own time, the Particulars have been revived as a plainclothes division for occasions when stealth and espionage are required). There are numerous protocols in place to ensure the fair treatment of prisoners, but for the longest time, the Particulars have been entirely ignoring protocol because their reputation is so nasty that even other coppers are afraid of them. Vimes is able to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a> and hobble the Particulars just by insisting on following protocol to the letter.

Sir Gerald knows that she can be trusted not to be indiscreet without signing anything and that she will refuse to sign on principle, but he also knows that his boss won't listen if he says so. Another thing he knows about his boss is that he always insists on conversations being reported verbatim, which gives him a plan of action: He goes to Modesty and conveys his order, carefully writes down her response, and returns to London, where his boss asks him how it went and he dutifully reports exactly where she told his boss to shove the NDA.

This naturally increases the rent and tax incomes of the more popular ones. One Count decided to breed several dozen girls in artificial wombs — a newly imported technology — to increase his district's population without having to improve his rule in any way. Though it was considered obviously wrong to exploit mass-produced children, he argued that he'd used his own genetic material for their paternal contribution, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rgbj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1rgbj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rgbj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">but <em>not</em> his wife's for the maternal aspect, a fact about which the Countess was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">extremely vexed</a> </span> and they were therefore technically his daughters.

Ekaterin provided a solution by pointing out that if they <em>are</em> his daughters, he could be required to pay a dowry for <em>each and every one of them</em> — at a level to be determined at the discretion of the Emperor. The last we see is him screaming in rage right after the judgement is handed to him.

Of course, when Peeves and the Weasley twins start wreaking havoc (at the possible suggestion of Dumbledore), the teachers just sit by and let it happen, claiming that they weren't sure they had the authority to do anything about it. For bonus points, at one point Harry not only sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Professor McGonagall</a> walk straight past while Peeves is trying to mess with a chandelier but he <em>swears</em> he hears her whisper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">"It unscrews the other way."</a>

</li><li> Dumbledore also manages to piss Umbridge off when she fires Trelawney by pointing out that although she has the power to fire teachers at Hogwarts, it doesn't mean she can also evict Trelawney from her home there, as the authority to decide the actual residency in the castle still lies with the Headmaster. He follows it up by reminding her that her right to hire staff applies only if he himself is unsuccessful in finding someone to fill the position and hires Firenze (a centaur, of which Umbridge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">terrified</a>) on the spot to take over as Divination teacher.

So the commander took a shuttle down to the village to tell everyone how doomed they were, going on in great detail about his firing plans, and explaining that as soon as he got back to his ship, their homes would be flattened by turbolasers. Then he got back in his shuttle and called up his officers to go over the firing plan again. And then had them calibrate the sensors and weapons. Then do another weapons check, so the show of force would be absolutely perfect. Three hours later he finally went back to his Star Destroyer and proceeded to annihilate the long-since-empty village. The commander spun his report to emphasize how the survivors would be sure to spread their terrible story, and the warlord didn't kill him but warned him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">not to fail him again</a>.

Imfray carries on the joke with an observation that hearing loss could see him out of the guard, and the man assures him that if anyone knows he was involved, it did.

Kelso specifically states that they'll work just fast enough that he can't fire them for it. And that he doesn't really have to worry about it because they won't do anything to hurt the patients.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas">Corner Gas</a></em> has Davis and Karen using "Work to rule" as a form of protest. When they tell the mayor they're working "By the book", the mayor happily gives them a copy of the rule book, which is an encyclopedia-sized tome. Since they normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">do barely any work at all</a>, this only ends up vastly increasing their workload.

Notably, he uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> to make everything worse; Space Corps directives say crewmembers in quarantine must be given films, literature, games, and pastimes - it doesn't say the media have to be any good (a knitting magazine and a DIY video) or the games have to be playable (a chess-set with almost all the pieces missing and a completed crossword book). Kryten figures they can use this against him, but by the time Kryten realizes this, Rimmer's... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">gone a little peculiar</a>.

He wants them to give him time to properly move a settlement away from a planet that the Sheliak are going to take over. They refuse to give him anywhere near enough time. Checking over the incredibly complicated rules they agreed to, he points out that he is permitted to request a neutral third party to arbitrate the discussion. They acknowledge his request, and he picks a race that is currently hibernating, meaning the Sheliak can either be stuck waiting for <em>several months</em>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">Know When to Fold 'Em</a> and just give Picard the week or two he originally suggested. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the Sheliak inevitably gave in and tried to contact the Enterprise to capitulate, he even left their incoming comm signal unanswered for quite a few seconds longer than necessary to make his point clear.</span>
</li><li> When the main characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> arrest a prison guard, the other guards show solidarity by refusing to transfer prisoners for arraignment unless the paperwork is perfect. On the first day, the arraignment judge manages to arraign less than an eighth of the defendants on his docket.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a moment in the first season where they invoked the Rush Act, giving the military CO of the station (Commander Sinclair) authority to end a dockworkers' strike by any means necessary. They obviously expect this to mean Sinclair will quell the strike by force; Sinclair, however, determines that the means necessary to end the strike involve drawing money from the station's defense budget to raise the dockers' wages so they'll go back to work, justifying it by saying that the smooth operation of the docks is necessary to the station's defense.
<div class="indent"><strong>Commander Sinclair:</strong> Never hand a man a loaded gun unless you know where he's going to aim it.
</div></li><li> A few episodes later, in the episode "Eyes", Sinclair tries this again against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInquisitorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInquisitorGeneral">The Inquisitor Colonel</a> sent to evaluate him and his crew. He does this because Colonel Ben Zayn seems bent on having him run off the station. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(He's right; the investigating officer wanted the Commander's chair for himself.)</span> At first it seems to work, but eventually the colonel manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours">out-Rule-Fu</a> him, forcing Sinclair to change tack.
</li><li> A later episode had Captain Sheridan effectively buy time to shut down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">pro-Earth</a> (and officially unofficial) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Night Watch</a> by careful use of this trope. The orders he'd received gave Night Watch a frankly scary array of powers and authority but had come from the Political Office, rather than through Earth Alliance military channels. He refused to implement his orders because they were from outside his chain of command. (This could only buy time, as Night Watch were one of President Clark's pet projects, and he <em>was</em> in the chain of command. Commander in Chief, to be precise.)
</li><li> Babylon 5 really seems to like this trope. Another episode had EarthDome trying to charge Sheridan and Ivanova 5 credits a month each rent for extra space in their officers' quarters. After Sheridan's protests failed to accomplish anything, he deducted ten credits a month from the budget for military preparedness and applied it against the rent, on the grounds that he's not prepared to fight anyone until he's had a decent night's sleep in his own damn bed.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePhilSilversShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePhilSilversShow">The Phil Silvers Show</a></em> featured Sgt Bilko's superiors trying to deal with him by pushing him into the Military Police to stop his various cons. Bilko deals with this by arresting everyone he can for the smallest infraction of the rules. On one occasion when one woman mocks his tone of voice for saying he's just following the rules, Bilko has her arrested for impersonating an officer.

The group decides to get back at him by drowning him in expense vouchers for cheap, mundane things that they bought out of pocket, each on a separate form.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sue:</strong> I used three sheets of a yellow pad at home last night for FBI business. That should be <em>three</em> vouchers.
</div><ul><li> Randy gets back at them by reimbursing the rental car <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingInCoins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingInCoins">in jars of unsorted coins.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, Donna and Margaret attempt this after Leo brushes off their concerns about the West Wing's compliance with carpal tunnel syndrome regulations due to all the typing the assistants do (with the claim that the White House is exempt from such regulations) with "Type slower." Donna gets all the aides, including Margaret, to do just that. Unfortunately for them, it's subverted, however, with Leo's stony "I-am-but-seconds-from-firing-you" glare upon finding out about this from Margaret ("Margaret, look at my face <em>right now</em>.") prompts her to immediately capitulate.
</li><li> A major point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FTroop">F Troop</a></em> was the Captain using the rule book to determine everything, including "Sunrise, How to determine for shooting people at" and refusing to believe in vampires since "They're not mentioned in the manual."
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrangeHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrangeHill">Grange Hill</a></em>, the students decided to attempt to stage a strike in school. When that failed, they went to the school rule book, of which they stole a copy from one of the teachers. The rule they picked was "Students must always walk in the hallways." So, they started <em><strong>always</strong></em> walking in the hallways - including walking when they should've actually been in class. When that tactic failed, they resorted to a second perambulatory rule, which was "Students must always walk on the left." This gave them an excuse to take the long way around to get from one classroom to the classroom immediately to its right, by walking on the left of the hall all the way around the school. Again the teachers were not happy, and all student-owned copies of the rule book were confiscated. Apparently only the teachers were supposed to know the exact wording of the rules; the students only got to know when they'd broken one.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BachelorFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BachelorFather">Bachelor Father</a></em>, Bentley Gregg's houseboy Peter Tong falls under the sway of his corrupt cousin Charlie, joining and becoming president of the Benevolent Society of Chinese Houseboys. When Peter goes on strike, Bentley decides to capitulate, following the B.S.C.H. labor contract to the letter. He installs a time-clock and a bell to hurry Peter through his duties, running him ragged. Peter gets a bigger paycheck at the end of the week, but after cousin Charlie takes his B.S.C.H. cut he winds up with much less than before. Peter promptly dissolves the B.S.C.H., and gives cousin Charlie an honest job as an "automatic dishwasher."
</li><li> Captain Sharon Raydor proves adept at this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MajorCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MajorCrimes">Major Crimes</a></em>, having previously worked in internal affairs. Case in point: On one occasion when she had no legal reason to hold a gang member to keep him from avenging his brother, she was able to create one by questioning him past his parole-mandated curfew.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDoctorBlakeMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDoctorBlakeMysteries">The Doctor Blake Mysteries</a></em>, Lucien uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokyGentlemensClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokyGentlemensClub">Smoky Gentlemen's Club</a>'s own rule book to prove that he is allowed to hang a painting of a nude in the club's main lounge.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>, dozens of cases would be dismissed at midnight if they aren't adjudicated due to overcrowding. When they get to the last one, a drunk driving case, the defendant refuses to waive reading the charges in court, since the paperwork listing them runs three full pages and there's under a minute to go. Dan Fielding, faced with losing one of his conquests reads the charges in <em>just</em> enough time for Judge Harry to rule "case remanded to the Grand Jury!" and bang his gavel before the clock strikes 12.
</li><li> In the episode "Voice Analyzer" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller">Barney Miller</a></em>, honest but excitable Wojo completely flunks a quote-unquote <em>voluntary</em>, definitely-not-a-lie-detector device just by doing the calibration questions. Dietrich responds by insisting on doing the test (after being reminded that it wasn't mandatory) and feeds it a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> without setting it off once. Barney goes a step further and forces Scanlan to back down by <em>not</em> volunteering, as the refusal of the squad's captain would make a significant statement—that, and Scanlan's outrage sends the machine into overdrive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>: One episode has a bunch of construction workers, angered by Rebecca charging them for beer, performing a slow-down outside the bar, making a job that should've taken a day last a month.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage">A French Village</a></em>: Daniel and other French officials who don't like what's going on will be sticklers for the rules as a means of obstruction. This only somewhat works though, as a lot of times they're simply ignored.

He doesn't have enough evidence of the man's criminal activities to arrest him, so instead he tells him to leave Portwenn and never return or Penhale will give his run-down van a very, very thorough road-worthiness inspection.

<ul><li> One of Denis Norden's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Feghoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Feghoot">Feghoots</a> on <em>My Word</em> explained how he worked his exit from the army with pedantically exact interpretations of his superior officers' orders, often based on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>'s pronunciation. For example, on being told to "quick march" (which came out as "Quick Hutch!"), he went AWOL and hid in a cupboard for several weeks, his argument being that "hutch" is a verb meaning "to put away in, or as in, a hutch".

It's generally frowned upon, as such players tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">"Stop Having Fun" Guys</a>, ignore the spirit of the rules (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero">Rule Zero</a>), and also have a suspicious tendency to only point out rules when it benefits them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTuber</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest">Puffin Forest</a> broke them down into two categories in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnj0CDX096A">this video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Rules Traditionalists stick to the rules out of a belief that it will improve the game, while Rules Hagglers invoke this trope to mask their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a very large number of stages and checks to be done in each turn. In a lot of games, <em>nothing happens</em> during many of them. As a fairly minor example of how this could be potentially frustrating:
<div class="indent"> Player 1: I end my main phase.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 2: Okay.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 1: The combat phase begins. Beginning of combat step.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 2: Oookay.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 1: Declare attackers step. Do you have a response?
</div><div class="indent"> Player 2: You don't have any creatures...
</div><div class="indent"> Player 1: I declare no attackers. Declare blockers step.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 2: There is <em>nothing to block</em>.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 1: Are you declaring any blockers?
</div><div class="indent"> Player 2: No.
</div><div class="indent"> Player 1: Combat damage step. No combat damage is dealt. End of Combat Step. Combat Phase Ends. Second Main Phase begins.
</div><ul><li> <em>Magic</em> actually <em>does</em> have rules that allow you to shortcut this process if both players have nothing to do, so trying this sort of thing in a tournament will get you a penalty for stalling and/or unsportsmanlike conduct for fishing for penalties. It's one key thing judges are taught to spot. In <em>casual</em> play, of course, your opponent will probably just start throwing stuff at you.
<ul><li> And a further shortcut to the scenario presented above: If an attacker declares no attackers during the Declare Attackers step, the game skips straight to the end of combat step.
</li><li> One famous incident at a French Nationals had a group of players try to use a typo in the most recent printing of the official card texts (Magic has a ton of errata on old cards) to use a devastatingly powerful combo. The head judge used his discretion to overrule the official wording ahead of the tournament and the players were disqualified when they still tried to do it. The DCI fully backed the judge's ruling.
</li></ul></li><li> There are <em>many</em> legitimate uses for such techniques. For example, if a source of mana is being destroyed, the opponent might tap it before it is gone, and then declaring a zero-creature attack can flush that mana pool. However, rather than be a jerk about it, it is much politer simply to explain where in the "glossed over" part of the turn you intend to intervene.
</li><li> The AI in <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> is smart enough to skip phases where no action is possible, but if you have <em>any</em> activated abilities available at the moment, it <em>will</em> give you an opportunity to activate them at every step, even if doing so would be deeply stupid. If, for example, you have an <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=adanto%20vanguard">Adanto Vanguard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in play, the game acts very much like Player 1 in the above example, constantly pausing to see if you'd like to pay 4 life to the Vanguard for no particular reason.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Square-Footed Monster", Ted Wassanasong began building an eyesore house in the middle of the Hills' neighborhood despite the protests of the neighbors. Subverted when they try using a county clerk to help them but he can't find any regulations to halt construction. Later the house falls down in a storm and the neighbors have to tear the house down with tools to prevent it from damaging their houses. Ted tries to take the neighborhood to court but the judge rules against him, so out of spite Ted sells the land to the city, which erects a power substation. The trope is immediately played straight as the county clerk digs out a regulation that lets the neighborhood build a façade house around the substation so no one has to look at it.
</li><li> Also used in the episode "Flush with Power" when Hank buys a lo-flow toilet in an effort to save water during a drought. However he discovers that the lo-flow toilets are faulty and actually use more water than the old ones. He wants to switch back but the Arlen zoning board has outlawed the old hi-flow toilets. So he tries to bring the issue before the board but they tell him only board members can introduce new legislation about the toilets. So Hanks joins the zoning board and tries to introduce the new legislation but none of the other board members are interested. He then discovers that the chairman of the board owns the company that makes the new toilets, hence his interest in keeping the law in place. Hank then tries again to introduce his legislation with this new information but the other board members are friends of the chairman and none of them own new toilets so they still vote no. Hank is about to give up when Peggy literally reads him the rules of Parliamentary Procedure and Hank proceeds to begin a filibuster until the other board members have to use the bathroom, and then realize that Hank was right about the new toilets being horrible, at which point they all change their votes to repeal the law and let hi-flow toilets be legal again (except for the chairman, who quits the meeting in anger).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> Invoked in an episode by Sam. After being caught covering for one of Otto and Twister's rule-breaking schemes, Sam is forced to join the Safety Patrol. At first, the other kids are happy, as they figure that having their friend on the Patrol will allow them to break all the rules they want and not get punished, but when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">push Sam too far</a>, he begins using the exact wording of the school's safety code to get them in all kinds of trouble. They try to reach a compromise, but Sam's already told the principal about an upcoming street hockey game in the teachers' parking lot. When the game begins, Sam seems stuck between ratting his friends out or violating his own Safety Patrol code...and he decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> by turning this trope <em>against</em> the principal. It turns out that while various activities are forbidden in the rule book, street hockey <em>isn't.</em>
</li><li> In another episode, the Rockets' obnoxious neighbor Merv Stimpleton ends up slightly injured (though he hugely exaggerates the extent of the damage) because of the kids' skating on the local boardwalk, and whips up other senior citizens into a frenzy to ban all forms of extreme sports from that area. The main four, along with all the other local skaters and rollerbladers, are at a loss... until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Merv's wife Violet</a>, who's firmly aware of what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> her husband is being, points out that all the kids need to do is find a place to skate that's "safe and friendly." This inspires Reggie, Otto, Twister, and Sam to create a miniature skate park in the Rockets' driveway, forcing Merv to deal with the noise and commotion every waking minute. A chastised Merv then moves toward a peaceful solution: working with the city to build an <em>actual</em> skate park for the local children.
</li></ul></li><li> In one U.S. Acres episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, the animals find a law book and decide to implement these laws on the farm. Orson names Roy Rooster as the Deputy Sheriff, and Roy quickly goes on a power trip arresting everyone for violating the extremely ridiculous laws in the book. They try to invoke this trope by telling Roy about the laws he's violating, and it backfires since Roy just locks himself in the jail cell with everyone else and throws away the key.
</li><li> In the "Last Action Zero" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a></em>, Brad joins the Skyway Patrol, only to discover that they're a bunch of over-glorified legalese bureaucrats who expect him to fill out paperwork in duplicate and triplicate before taking any action whatsoever, and any heroic action done without proper paperwork is considered dangerous. Brad manages to outwit the Skyway Patrol by giving them overwhelming heaps of paperwork to be filled out in duplicate, triplicate, and other multiples beyond that, leaving them with a burden full of excessive paperwork to be authorized and notarized.
</li><li> Invoked in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> when the kids find a playground games rulebook written by a legendary playground king named King Morty. They are eager to implement these rules and since King Bob is busy trying to dictate his memoirs he orders his two lackeys to enforce them. At first, the kids are happy but things quickly turn sour because the rules are increasingly more like farm chores than games. The trope is then invoked by T.J. because the lackeys use literal "fun police" to force the children to adhere to the rules of King Morty so long as they are on the playground so T.J. simply has the kids leave the playground. The lackeys try to arrest the entire school anyway which causes a riot until King Bob shows up. The kids explain the ridiculous rules to King Bob who agrees that they are years and years out of date (King Morty lived in The Great Depression), and so declares the rules of King Morty void.

<ul><li> Work to Rule is a labor action taken when workers follow rules and regulations to the letter, doing no more work than required and taking no shortcuts. Often, in cases of particularly labyrinthine rules, this can slow the workplace to a crawl or even cause it to grind to a halt, if the rule book doesn't match actual practice or how you can get anything accomplished. For added irony, this tactic is often informally used in response to a perceived excessive emphasis on following insignificant rules and regulations that aren't really necessary for safe and quality work i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">"You want us to really follow the rules? Okay!"</a> Also called a White Strike or Italian Strike.
</li><li> The term for this in the military is "white mutiny," usually done if a soldier has an order and/or a commanding officer he doesn't particularly care for. In a white mutiny, the soldier will follow every order exactly as stated, nothing more and nothing less, without using his judgment or applying adjustments to the specific situation. If enough soldiers do this or one soldier does this long enough, it's usually going to bring the entire operation to a grinding halt.
<ul><li> Due to the nature of military service, this is a very effective technique. In the employment-at-will private sector, doing this sort of thing can get you fired very quickly. Military personnel, however, can be disciplined but firing them is just not possible. You can have them disciplined or discharged from the military, but that takes a lot of time and documentation. Following orders to the letter is <em>very</em> difficult to successfully bring to court-martial. As an example, if a soldier is ordered to unload a truck, under this trope he will unload it...into the parking lot next to the truck. No one told him <em>where</em> to unload it. If he is then ordered to move the cargo into the warehouse, he will...wherever there is room, even if it blocks access to other items. No one told him <em>where</em> to put the cargo. If told to put it in a specific place, he will do so...by haphazardly throwing them there. No one told him to arrange them <em>neatly</em>. If told to arrange them neatly, he will spread them out so they take up the most room on the floor. No one defined <em>neatly.</em> If told to rearrange them so they take up less space, he will stack them impractically high. Now they take up less <em>horizontal</em> space. If he is called out at any point, he simply replies that he is following his orders to the letter.
<ul><li> Additionally, this trope is commonly used with junior officers who are either martinets or Neidermeyers, and it's generally more than one subordinate using it. If the officer seeks to take disciplinary action, they must then get <em>their</em> chain of command involved, which means their superiors are going to start asking questions about why their personnel are behaving this way...which casts light on their incompetence as officers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> French railway employees were forbidden to strike after the railways were nationalized. They scanned the rule book and found that regulations stated the engineer had to check at every overpass for obstructions on the tracks, and if he wasn't sure, to consult with the rest of the train crew. It wasn't usually done, of course, for the simple reason that doing so put the trains ridiculously behind schedule... which is exactly what happened when they started doing it. They couldn't be penalized for enforcing the rules, but it got results.
</li><li> Postal workers in Austria did much the same thing, strictly enforcing a rule that all packages and letters must be weighed to ensure there was enough postage for them, leaving the post offices filled up with unweighed mail by the second day. <a class="urllink" href="http://libcom.org/organise/work-to-rule">Seen here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul><ul><li> "Malicious Compliance" is the common management phrase for this, particularly if it isn't just taking advantage or a protest but an attempt to actually subvert or destroy an individual, project, or organization.
</li><li> There weren't exactly any explicit rules, but since slaves in antebellum America couldn't easily rise up and overthrow their masters (though it was attempted in some notable rebellions), and running away was rather risky, many would instead resist passive-aggressively by working as slowly as they could get away with, and intentionally screwing up so that their masters would think they were stupid and not trust them with difficult tasks.
</li><li> During the same time period, the Union would often protect escaped slaves who fled north by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">always listing them as "contraband"</a>. Prior to the 13th amendment, slavery was still legal and thus owners could reclaim the slaves as their property. By that same token, however, slaves could be "confiscated" as contraband if the slave owner was breaking the law and resisting Federal authority. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Seceding from the Union and raising an army against it would certainly qualify as such by most standards</a>. As they marched south, the Union Army liberated occupied areas by continuing the charade. They'd confiscate all "contraband" they came across and then disposed of the "property" they had no use for by freeing them.
</li><li> This is also the origin behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Capoeira</a>. The slaves couldn't spar to train for an eventual overthrow but could play and dance, which they used to disguise the training. To this day, sparring and practicing in capoeira is called playing.
</li><li> A heroic example is the story of the "Belgian Ghost Train", in which during the final days of the German occupation of Belgium in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, members of the Belgian National Railways managed to prevent a trainload of political prisoners being taken to Germany for extermination by finely judged bureaucratic time-wasting, as well as sabotage and, in some cases, running away and hiding.

The KKK being obnoxious racists, no-one wanted to formally acknowledge them as a civic organization. Yet, the law in the United States says they were free to associate, speak, and work in the community no matter how noisome they are. The solution?

In short (and for non-Hebrew speakers), Tibi is serving as substitute chairman for the meeting, and as one of the MKs. He (as MK) wishes to take the podium in order to present a bill to the Knesset — but then there will be no chairman to substitute him. Therefore, he (as an MK) must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">request from himself</a> (as chairman) to allow himself to present the bill from his current seat. An idiomatically translated transcript of the best bit:
<div class="indent"><strong>MK Ne'eman:</strong> Does your honor have a conflict of interest? <br/><strong>MK Tibi:</strong> There is a conflict — the possibility of recessing came up, but I said that today was a special day, there's a semifinal, so in spite of it, there's no reason to hurt people's chances of getting home on time. [Looks down at his text] Your honor the chairman, which is me, your honor the Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen the Members of the Knesset, there is no doubt that— <br/><strong>MK Shai:</strong> You need to set a limit for your time! <br/><strong>MK Tibi:</strong> I'll call myself to order if I carry on.
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> It should be noted that Tibi is an Arab Israeli and the leader of the Arab Ta'al party; Arab parties are (though it is officially frowned upon) made to feel unwelcome among many legislators. He found himself at the head of the meeting somewhat unexpectedly, so one can't really fault him for enjoying doing this kind of thing to thumb his nose at the rest of the Knesset. In addition to his special situation as an Arab MK, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> record would indicate that he makes a habit of this kind of improv comedy on slow days in the Knesset.
</dd></dl><ul><li> Similarly to Ahmad Tibi, but probably apocryphally, future Confederate General Braxton Bragg once was serving as both quartermaster of a small frontier base and commander of one of the companies stationed there. As company commander, he filed a supply requisition that, as quartermaster, he felt duty-bound to reject. With neither half of him willing to yield, the issue had to be referred to the incredulous post commandant. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s memoirs, that worthy exclaimed:
<div class="indent">"My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarreled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarreling with yourself!"
</div></li><li> Acting out this trope is a somewhat popular way to introduce algorithms to new computer science students, to drive home the points that computers are perfectly logical and have absolutely no common sense whatsoever. Ask the classroom for directions on something simple (making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, for example), and then <em>follow the directions</em>. For example, if the class comes up with "take out two slices of bread, put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, then put the slices of bread together", look at the bread and complain that you can't take any slices out because it's in a sealed bag. When they amend the earlier instructions to include "open the bag", rip the bag open as violently as possible, take out two slices, put the peanut butter (still in its jar) on top of one slice, the jelly (ditto) on another, put the slices side by side, and declare it a sandwich. And so on, until the class writes you some properly detailed instructions. As the saying goes:
<div class="indent"> The good thing about computers is that they do exactly what you tell them to. <br/>The bad thing about computers is that they do <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">exactly</a></strong></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">what you tell them to</a>.
</div></li><li> Supposedly, this provides the best chance of beating a speeding ticket. If the case is just your word against the cop's, you always lose. Very few cops, however, come to the hearing with all the maintenance records of their equipment (and police radar guns are rarely maintained as precisely as required by regulation). Whether you were actually speeding or not, they can't cite you based on "faulty" equipment.
</li><li> This is also how specialized DUI (<strong>D</strong>riving <strong>U</strong>nder the <strong>I</strong>nfluence of alcohol)/DWI (<strong>D</strong>riving <strong>W</strong>hile <strong>I</strong>ntoxicated) lawyers help clients beat DUI charges, at least in the U.S. In most jurisdictions, the prosecution must prove that you were intoxicated to support a DUI conviction, and in most jurisdictions, intoxication is considered proven if your blood alcohol content (BAC) exceeds 0.08%, with increased penalties if the BAC exceeds some higher figure, generally between 0.10% or 0.15%. Just one problem—measuring blood alcohol content directly (by taking a blood sample) is a pain, not only in the sense that it is painful and invasive for the suspect, but also because drawing blood is a technical hassle for the police both medically and (in the U.S. at least) legally (they need a warrant). So they rely on specialized breath-testing equipment kept at the police station to prove it indirectly based on breath alcohol content (BrAC). Measured accurately and under certain circumstances, BrAC correlates well enough with BAC to support a conviction. However, the equipment needs to be correctly calibrated, and certain procedures need to be followed. If the police failed to correctly calibrate the equipment or did not follow correct procedure, the court must rely on the police observation of the driver to support a finding of intoxication—which can be quite difficult and is often seen as a waste of police and prosecutorial resources—and cannot make a finding at all regarding the increased penalties for BAC exceeding 0.10% (or whatever). This is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a>'s Supreme Court devoted <a class="urllink" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814645192369746502">no fewer than 102 pages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the <em>New Jersey Reports</em> to the circumstances under which a newly-developed piece of breath-testing equipment was accurate enough to serve as evidence of intoxication (<em>State v. Chun</em>, 194 N.J. 54 (2008)), and why (in the same state) up to <em>20,000</em> DWI convictions (as of 2017) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/10/20k_dwi_cases_could_be_tossed_amid_state_police_pr.html">may be thrown out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because <em>one</em> State Trooper responsible for calibrating the machines in a number of towns didn't use the right kind of thermometer in doing his calibrations.
</li><li> This crops up occasionally in cases when the public feels that a highway could safely handle a speed limit increase (for instance, 100 km/h to 120 km/h.) Because police can give you a speeding ticket for driving over the limit, some people purposely block all lanes of the highway and drive at exactly the posted speed limit.
</li><li> During the "Separate but Equal" era of American Segregation, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund realized that it did not have the support required to strike down segregation as defined by <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>. So instead, the lawyers would sue institutions for failing to follow the "equal" part <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, and failing to make black facilities just as good as the ones for whites (which was extremely common, because racism). The NAACP's most famous case being <em>Sweatt v. Painter</em> which ruled that the University of Texas was breaking the law as its law school for black students was grossly inferior compared to the one for white students. This court case had the effect of desegregating higher education almost overnight as schools realized that none of them could afford to run two separate universities of equal quality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">Just as the NAACP planned.</a>
