</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> has a lot of them in there such as:
<ul><li> Char Aznable of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> shows all the symptoms. Bonus points in the first series for being rehired by the very government he betrayed and deserted; yet, Char states at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em> that he'll leave his ambitions of escorting mankind to space to the AEUG. In the years that follow, however, he gets tired of waiting around, culminating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>. He was forced into leaving AEUG, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">faking his death after losing to Haman</span>. He was never really comfortable in the AEUG anyway, and being presumed dead helped him get out of his obligations; it's not really treason so much as not renewing his contract for another term.
<ul><li> However, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>-era <em>Zeta Gundam</em> game offered a bit more elaboration in Quattro's storyline: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamille's getting mind raped was the tipping point since he wanted to entrust the future to Kamille's generation</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Zechs Merquise aka Milliardo Peacecraft in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> leads a life of it. His life, in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">very closely mirrors Char's</a>, though the sequence is a bit different.
<ul><li> First abandons his family and country to join The Alliance, which destroyed it.
</li><li> Betrays the Alliance in a coup to join Treize and OZ.
</li><li> Leaves OZ after Treize is deposed and goes crazy for a while. (Including assuming a role as a "peace ambassador" that went around blowing things up for no good reason.)
</li><li> Joins White Fang against OZ (now without Treize)
</li><li> Leads White Fang against all of Earth (now with Treize)
</li><li> Stops Earth's destruction and commits suicide...
</li><li> ....only to return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</a></em> to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for the woman he loves and his (kidnapped) younger sister.
</li></ul></li><li> Paptimus Scirocco from <em>Zeta</em> gives Char and his various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expies</a> a run for their money. He swears his loyalty to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Jamitov</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Bosque</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Haman</a>, only to betray them all in turn. He kills Jamitov directly and orders the deaths of Bosque and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Jamaican</a> via his followers. Through his double-dealing, he climbs the ladder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">from a nobody from Jupiter to the unquestioned master of the Titans</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> - Ribbons!. Alejandro Corner, Wang Liu Mei, and Regene Regetta are also not very trustworthy people. Their betrayals are often of each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> - The Frost Brothers betray from their initial debut up until the final episode, killing basically everyone who either employed them or worked for them.

<ul><li> Suzaku Kururugi appears to be this. Bismark, the Knight of One, even lampshades the trope by openly stating that he betrays everyone and everything, <em>and they expected him to do that</em>. However, if you look past the surface, it's a lot more complicated.
</li><li> There's also Diethard Reid, who first worked for the Britannian empire, then became a Black Knight, and then joined Schneizel. He follows whoever he thinks will cause the most upheaval and destruction in the near future, and he wants to be right there to "document" it.

One suspects said "chairman may just be doing it for laughs".
</li><li> By the same token, the leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a> has no qualms about having his underlings covertly assassinated, or with starting a new faction and backstabbing <em>everybody</em> when his invasion plans don't work out.

Despite living in a world steeped in betrayal and intrigue, Tsukiyo notes that the legitimacy of the Spy Foundation as an institution is founded on tradition and trust. If a spy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>, their clients will lose all trust in them. This is why Taiyo is the only one to pass that year's exam: he's the only one who went back to help Tsukiyo despite being given a clear shot to the spy license.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> has a few examples. <em>End of Evangelion</em> kicks off with Gendo and the SEELE committee simultaneously betraying each other and every single other faction in the series. On the other hand, Ryoji Kaji is simultaneously double-crossing SEELE, NERV, and the Japanese government all in a personal quest to figure out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">what the fuck is going on</a>, and he turns out to be one of the more unambiguously heroic characters on the show. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't get away with it, though.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> - Xellos is a pretty good example of this trope, as his loyalties can (And <em>will</em>) change at the drop of a hat (except for Zelas Metallium, the mazoku lord he serves). In the books, the sheer awesomeness of this is turned up to eleven. Mazoku are bound, absolutely, to follow the orders of their superiors. He still manages to betray them.

Eventually, Starscream's absolute rule got nerfed somewhat when a multi-planet council of Cybertronians was formed with lost Transformer colonies. The result is a government where everyone expects Starscream to be treacherous and self-serving and works around it with their own plots. It functions surprisingly well.

Even years later, post-Insight, it's still her first instinct to hoard secrets in case she needs them later for leverage, even when it would be expedient to not keep them. Early on, she withholds intel from Steve Rogers that would have aided in an op, and it rightfully pisses him off. That, combined with how much she liked the feeling of having someone's trust and being trusted in return that ultimately got her to defect to SHIELD in the first place, are what convince her that she needs to stop and make a change.

<ul><li> The Sith use betrayal and treachery as their <em>modus operandi</em>. If you're able to keep what you take, you deserved it. If the Master can't keep his subordinates in line, then he shouldn't be the Master.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, it is common among Sith to backstab anyone and everyone in order to better themselves.

A Master without an apprentice is a Master of nothing."
</div><ul><li> The Sith had it so bad that they were almost destroyed by the Jedi simply because they couldn't stop backstabbing each other while the more unified Jedi picked them off one by one.

Both cases get somewhat out of hand even by Sith standards since masters and apprentices alike have powerful allies; the result is <em>two</em> Sith civil wars right in the middle of a major battle with the Republic.
<ul><li> Even by Sith standards, the Warrior's master, Darth Baras, seems to have a very big problem with this. Baras betrays an entire fleet of ships to the Jedi when it suited his needs, and Baras sends his apprentice to kill his own spies, contacts, underlinings, and then a member of the Dark council all before the Baras eventually turns on his apprentice.

They tend to betray each other every so often, working to undermine or outright sabotage the greater goal of corrupting and destroying humanity. It is when they can put their issues aside for a short time that things get bad for humanity. The last time two faction leaders actually got together for a time led to the Black Plague in Europe.
</li><li> One member of this collective is Lasciel. She is known by her monikers of Webweaver and the Seducer. She wasn't banished from Heaven just for siding with Lucifer, but rather because she tried playing both sides against each other to come out on top no matter what. When things settled, God did not take favorably to this action and kicked her out too.
</li><li> Their lack of unity and backstabbing nature is the reason Lucifer chose these thirty Fallen to be placed in these coins. He had convinced each one of them they were better off fighting God and lost big time. It was only a matter of time before some of them rebelled against him to take him down. So, he sent into the coins the most dangerous of the Fallen to keep them away from his position in Hell.

Exemplifying this is Lady Charmian, whose backstab against her newlywed husband (for the offense of leering at a chambermaid) ends up costing her father his life, through a long series of circumstances. She then arranges for her disgraced husband's rescue from the rebels, arranges for him to duel with her current lover (expecting him to lose), sets him up to be killed by a demon when that fails, backstabs numerous rivals for power, and eventually betrays her husband again after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> to the rebel side. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">But somehow she never quite goes through with killing him when she has the chance to do it herself.</a></span>

Everyone moves up through assassination and/or betrayal of their superiors. And they get away with it, as long as they protect themselves from others assassinating/betraying them because that's how you <em>legitimately</em> advance in their culture.

The reason given is that draconic blood is chaotic by its nature and cannot abide its own proximity. As Silchas Ruin explains it, to the Eleint "any notion of community is anathema" and they see any world as a feeding ground which exists to sate their innate megalomania. To drink draconic blood and become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Soletaken Eleint</a> means gaining a taste for betrayal and a lust for power for their own sakes and only a handful of people are said to have ever overcome this urge, most of whom were several generations removed from their draconic ancestors.

Cao, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, said simply, "Strangle and expose."
<ul><li> Cao Cao did it after asking Liu Bei (who was working under him at that time, see below) what to do with Lu Bu. Liu Bei lampshaded this trope for him: "Don't you remember what happened to Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo?" (Lu Bu's two previous adoptive fathers, both killed by him)
</li></ul></li><li> Liu Bei himself is an ambiguous case. He's talked up as a great hero, but everyone he ever works for (except Cao Cao, who suffered a series of humiliating defeats) dies, normally after willing their entire empire to him.

</li><li> Wei Yan was portrayed as one, lampshaded by Zhuge Liang: He killed his previous master and surrendered the city to Liu Bei (A while ago he betrayed another master when said master was fighting against, guess what, Liu Bei). Zhuge Liang urged Liu Bei to killed him, citing "The bones of treachery grows in his brain". Liu Bei didn't kill him, and he remained under Shu service as an important general for a couple of decades. He committed treason again after Zhuge Liang died, though.

</li><li> House Bolton has the motto of "Our Blades Are Sharp" ostensibly about their traditional family practice of skinning condemned prisoners.

Already King of Siluria, Gundleus is set to marry Uther's daughter in the wake of Uther's death and be the regent for Uther's infant grandson, who will be the future High King. Instead, Gundleus gets greedy and decides to shoot at becoming High King himself, murdering his wife to be and attempting to kill the baby as well. After Arthur captures him alive and treats him well, Gundleus promptly sides against Arthur in the next round of warfare among the British kingdoms when it looks like Arthur is going to lose. Oh, and in addition to killing his wife and attempting infanticide, Gundleus also rapes another character and rips out her eye. Fun guy, and particularly notable because even without doing any backstabbing he would in a position to wield enormous power.
</li><li> Bishop Sansum is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Churchman</a> who operates on a single rule when it comes to the endless wars and political squabbles between the British kingdoms: be on the winning side. As soon as one faction gets the upper hand, Sansum is sure to make himself just useful enough to them that he'll survive and prosper regardless of who actually wins.

The fact that he does not see their betrayal of him coming adds a nice layer of irony to the episode and the fact that they have proceeded to repeat this betrayal multiple times, and that each time he has failed to see it coming, just adds to the deliciousness of it.

Mavic Chen is already a traitor, being the most powerful man in the Solar System already but planning to gain more power by betraying humanity to the Daleks. This is pointed out by one of the Daleks' other allies, as none of them (the Daleks end up betraying them as well) sold out their own people.

</li><li> Fifth Doctor companion/would-be assassin Turlough originally met the Doctor after the Black Guardian offered the exiled alien schoolboy a lift off planet Earth in return for killing the Doctor. He abandoned and betrayed the Doctor pretty much anytime things got too dangerous, even after Fivey forgave him for the whole, you know, attempted murder thing. However, he always seemed to redeem himself by doing something heroic, especially in his last episode, Planet of Fire.
</li><li> Whenever the Cybermen make a bargain, they never hold up their end of it.

<ul><li> Sikozu was an embodiment of this trope, her only consistent trait (besides total arrogance) being her capacity for 'sudden and inevitable betrayal'. Close to the end of the fourth season, however, she looked to be outgrowing this character flaw- only for the Scarrans to employ her as a spy during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>. Her comeuppance finally came at the hands of her current boyfriend Scorpius, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">beat her to a bloody pulp</a> and left her to die.
</li><li> Grunchlk in the episodes "Die Me Dichotomy" and "Season of Death" qualifies: while overcharging the crew of Moya for various medical services, he quietly betrays them to Scorpius. However, when Scorpius arrives with a squad of heavily-armed Peacekeeper commandos, Grunchlk panics and releases a Scarran warrior from stasis in an attempt to hold the attackers off. And it turns out that the Scarran was also double-crossed by Grunchlk...
</li><li> During season 4, Crichton believes that Scorpius suffers from this disorder after he joins the crew. Crichton has good reason to be suspicious of Scorpy, but seems to believe that Scorpius is going to try and backstab him at the most idiotic times: for example, in "I Shrink Therefore I Am" he gives Scorpius an empty rifle just in case any treachery occurs- while they're both stuck on Moya, with all their escape ships disabled, and being hunted by bounty hunters with no interest in negotiations. Lo and behold, Scorpius isn't that dumb. Eventually, Crichton decides that Scorpius can at least be trusted to a certain extent after several incidents where not only remains loyal but even puts his own life on the line to save the day at least twice. Unfortunately, after being used as bait for Talikaa, Scorpius decides he's had enough of his role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> and backstabs Crichton so masterfully that it takes him two episodes to figure out who was <em>really</em> behind Aeryn's kidnapping.

</div></li><li> The City Watch of King's Landing will always support whoever pays them the most.
</li><li> House Frey is infamously unreliable because of their passive self-interest: they avoid taking sides unless they have something significant to gain. Most houses are smart enough to assume the Freys will sell them out the moment they receive a better offer.
</li><li> In-universe House Greyjoy has this reputation due to attempts to rebel whenever they think they have the slightest chance of winning (and even when they really don't).
<ul><li> Balon Greyjoy led a failed rebellion against Robert in the backstory, causing his son Theon to be taken hostage by Ned Stark. He rebels again the moment his son returns because turmoil engulfs the realm.
</li></ul></li><li> Cersei politely insinuates that Brienne has this, seeing how she swore to serve Renly, then Catelyn, then Jaime. Brienne replies that she does not serve Jaime.
</li><li> The Stark family seems to be an inversion of this as multiple members are victims of betrayals which lead to their deaths.
<ul><li> Ned Stark was betrayed by Littlefinger and Janos Slynt to the service of Cersei and King Joffrey, ultimately leading to his beheading.
</li><li> Rob and Catelyn were betrayed by the Freys and Boltons leading to their deaths well as that of Robb's wife, unborn child, and bannermen in the infamous Red Wedding.
</li><li> Jon Snow was tricked and betrayed by Olly and Allister Thorn along with other members of the Night's watch, all of whom took turns stabbing him then left him to bleed out. He got better.
</li></ul></li><li> Ramsay murders several of his own men to gain Theon's trust, then turns on <em>him</em>. He also <em>habitually</em> breaks promises of safe conduct to enemies who surrender to him - and instead horrifically tortures them by flaying men alive by the dozen and leaving their mutilated corpses on public display. His father has become increasingly frustrated at him for his sheer lack of future planning. In season six, it reaches its head when he murders his father, his stepmother, and his newborn brother, all to seize power for himself.
</li><li> Zigzagged trope with Jaime. This is his reputation. In reality, his killing of King Aerys is far more complex: Aerys told him to kill his own father and was also planning on burning down and killing everyone in King's Landing. Unfortunately, Jaime's pride and pessimism discouraged him from revealing that true reason for killing Aerys. On the other hand, if word were to ever get out that Jaime had brutally killed his younger cousin, Alton Lannister, then he would be known as a <em>kinslayer</em>, the <em>only</em> thing worse than being a kingslayer in Westeros, as well.
</li><li> Varys is a rare <em>benevolent</em> example. He worked for several regimes over the course of his life and has secretly worked to undermine them whenever they saw they were too oppressive or ineffective and in Season 7, he declares to Daenerys that he is is not loyal to her, or any ruler, but loyal to the people and the realm and the reason why he backs her is because he believes she is the best ruler who looks after the people's wellbeing.

Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">the more sympathetic villains</a> on <em>Gotham</em> seem to be more prone to stabbing each other in the back during various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamup">villain teamups</a> than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">more unhinged villains</a> who just want to destroy everything or cause chaos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">for the fun of it.</a> For example, while Jerome Valeska is prone to killing his mooks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">for being annoying or even just for a laugh,</a> he's not motivated by money or power and so doesn't have a reason to backstab any of the major villains he teams up with, unless they betray him first. His alliance with Tetch and Scarecrow doesn't fall apart due to betrayal, even though Tetch outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> the fact that they will all probably end up betraying each other eventually. Jeremiah later allies with Scarecrow, Tetch, and Ra's Al Ghul without having any problems, either, most likely for the same reasons: because they have the same goals and are not actually competing with each other. Oswald, on the other hand, who has quite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments in the series despite being a ruthless mob boss with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a>, continually betrays people for power, money, and even love. So does Barbara Kean, despite generally being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">A Lighter Shade of Black</a> when compared to people like the Valeska brothers and Scarecrow. Edward Nygma/The Riddler also frequently betrays people over things like love and revenge despite generally having more standards than other villains. While this is counterintuitive, it actually makes sense, as the saner villains are actually capable of forming genuine friendships with each other and therefore more vulnerable to being betrayed.

Part of what's most amazing about the crew is that they still manage to work together even with some of the people who very cruelly betrayed them.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> was teaming up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> to become a championship tag team. Given that they were slated to compete at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> for the WWE Championship, the team seemed shaky but HBK was determined to keep Cena at 100% for WrestleMania. Cena was consistently worried that HBK would turn on him as he had done with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq_u89b-SIk">every single person and team he had ever worked with.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Inevitably, yes, HBK turned on Cena. Shawn even lampshaded it during the 2013 Slammy Awards when he won the Double-Cross of the Year award, finding it strange that despite the number of times he's betrayed someone over his storied career, only three years after retirement does he actually win an award for it.
</li><li> Starting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>'s debut, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a> switched allegiances between him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> for the rest of Bearer's time in WWE. It actually started when Bearer abandoned Undertaker for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> after six years of managing The Undertaker.
<ul><li> Much like his father Paul Bearer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> has his share of betrayals as well. The Undertaker is his prime victim as Taker puts up with him &amp; always accepts him back more than anyone else. In 97, Kane is under command of Paul Bearer and wants revenge on Taker for killing their parents. They do everything to provoke him into a fight, and nothing works until Kane literally sets Taker on fire. They feud afterwards but iron out their differences until Taker betrays Kane at Judgement Day 98 during his Ministry period. This is the only time Taker betrayed Kane. All of their subsequent feuds were started by Kane.
<ul><li> During his Ministry period, Taker wanted Kane to join him but Kane was unwavering. Eventually Kane started gravitating toward Taker which caused friction with X-Pac, with whom he'd formed a bond. X-Pac demanded Kane chose between them and Taker said he'd never make Kane chose. With that, Kane joined Taker but eventually betrayed him with a chokeslam when he attacked X-Pac.
</li><li> When Taker returned as The American Badass in 2000, he &amp; Kane had a strained relationship, especially with both going after the WWF title. However, Taker did offer Kane advice before matches &amp; watched out for him a bit. It came to an end when Kane chokeslamed him through the ring, injuring his ribs. Taker returned the following night to confront Kane who refused to give him an explanation. Kane went to leave the ring as Taker yelled at him and relented in frustration, but as soon as Taker's back was turned, Kane ambushed &amp; brutalized him. They feud into Summerslam where Taker unmasked Kane causing him to run from the arena.
</li><li> Eventually all is forgiven and they form a tag-team as <em>The Brothers of Destruction</em> in 2001 with their bond being stronger than ever. Though the brand split separated them, a small scene in 2002 showed they were still on good terms despite being on different brands. This ended in 2003 when Kane attacked Taker at Survivor Series and helped Vince bury him alive. Kane later says Taker had become too human &amp; was a shell of his former self, a fake. This leads to their feud in 2004 when Taker returned as The Deadman once again and defeated Kane at Wrestlemania.
</li><li> Once again by 2006, all was forgiven with Taker and Kane occasionally teaming up and helping each other until 2009 when Taker is put in a vegetated state from an unknown attacker that is revealed to be Kane. Once again, Kane says Taker is still weak and a shell of his old self whom he'd put out of his misery. It lead to another feud between the two when Taker returned in 2010. However, this would be their last feud before Taker's feud with HHH in 2011. Taker didn't interact with Kane until he showed on the 1000th episode of RAW in 2012 to help Kane fight off numerous attackers. Again, Taker has apparently forgiven Kane and the latter has not betrayed him since then.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> specific examples:
<ul><li> The Skaven consider Chronic Backstabbing Disorder to be a desirable way of life and those who know of their existence believe this is the only reason they haven't taken over the whole Warhammer world.
</li><li> Hobgoblins backstab everyone they interact with, to such a degree that they are evolving a bony plate in their most stabbable area. Even Goblins, who will cheerfully rob, swindle, betray and even eat each other in a pinch, consider the Hobgoblins to be despicable backstabbers and refuse to associate with them even on the battlefield.

The only reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Malekith</a> is still in charge is because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">strong enough to make any traitors</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">dearly</a></em> regret their decision.

<ul><li> The Dark Eldar are quite fond of betraying each other and are probably a greater threat to each other as they are to their actual enemies.
</li><li> Kharn the Betrayer got his nickname from an incident where even his fellow World Eaters thought it was too cold to fight. Enraged at this lack of moral fibre, he grabbed a flamer and started setting fire to friend and foe alike.

What a swell guy.
</li><li> The C'tan known as the Deceiver is another master of this - he constantly switched sides during the war between the C'tan and the Old Ones, and when neither side would trust him, he started using disguises. According to the Necron Codex, the mistrust sown between the various races serving the Old Ones by the Deceiver's machinations probably did more for the C'tan war effort than the efforts of the other three remaining C'tan combined.

He doesn't even need a <em>reason</em> to betray one of his "allies"; he'll do it just to spite them. He is the reason you can't have nice things. He doesn't just betray his allies, he betrays <em>himself</em>. He's only crafted one jouten (physical body — most Yozi have multiple different bodies, often operating simultaneously) because he <em>knows</em> that if he crafts any more, they'll try to turn on him. Even then, he still manages to screw himself by constructing plots that screw 'the Yozi' as a group without constructing any exemptions for himself into them. Sometimes. He's actually rather inconsistent about it, which the writers tend to describe as him 'keeping himself guessing'. The Ebon Dragon has plans to break out of Hell. He's aligned with his fellow kings of Hell to get out but plans to close the gate on them once he's out if he can help it. However, it's said that, should he pull this off, his <em>own component souls</em> will fight to keep some part of him trapped in Hell, because he can't help but betray himself on the most fundamental level.

It was intended to share their loot and rule without the rules of society. When Nate and Sam find it, the place is a total ruin with obvious signs of some massive battle. It turns out that a society led by <em>pirates</em>, people whose sole goal in life is robbery and hoarding wealth, was doomed from the start. It didn't take long for the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pirate kings to fight for the treasure so Avery and Thomas Tew got them all together to make peace over a dinner...and poisioned the entire bunch so they could have the treasure for themselves. Then, when the populace rises up in revolt, Tews stabs Avery in the back to try and get the treasure himself only for Avery to end up killing him and the entire "pirate utopia" became a mass graveyard</span>.

Among various other political machinations, House Solidor (the Archadean Emperor's family) all seem to have this. The implied background is that the eldest two sons, possibly on separate occasions, plotted against Emperor Gramis, who had the third son, Vayne, kill them. During the game, Gramis plots <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> against Vayne, correctly predicting that Larsa, the youngest son, would make for a better and more stable Emperor. At the same time, The Senate is trying to seize power from House Solidor, particularly fearful that Vayne will take the throne. At the same time, Vayne plots against Gramis, The Senate, and Larsa, framing the Senate for Gramis' murder, so that he can take the throne before Larsa can. As the plot goes on, Larsa plots against the Archadian war, making contacts with rival and conquered countries to make peace. In the climax, the brothers actively raise their swords against one another</span>.

As long as they had the Republic to fight, they were fine. Once the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, the Sith predictably started passing the time backstabbing each other with everyone else from the military, the intelligence service, and even low-level officials trying to undermine each other while individual Sith occasionally splinter off into their own fiefs. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Out of the four Imperial player classes, only the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a></em> is actually fighting a Republic target for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, and the Hunter can actually choose to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and kill the Darth hiring them instead!

Often one of the other two kingdoms' strategists will send you a letter asking you to defect to their side. Notably, this can happen repeatedly, and you can keep defecting as many times as you receive offers. Do this enough, and your character will gain the title of "The Hidden Blade," with a well deserved reputation for being reliably untrustworthy.

You have a faction that you are part of for the game, you are assigned a general who gives you your pay and rank missions. If you go to a specific general each day and collect 2 months worth of stamps, you can get one stamp per day on a character, you can "reincarnate" and go to a different faction mid-war. You are treated as a new warrior to them rather than as a traitor to your old faction. if you made a habit of this you could probably go 4 different times per scenario.

Most of his quests throughout the series involve pulling this in one way or another. In <em>Skyrim</em>, Boethiah requires that you bring and sacrifice a follower (someone who trusts you) at her shrine in order to even summon her to receive her quest.

First (that we know of) he betrayed Emily Ortel by not giving her anything like she promised for programming <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yes Man</span>, who is in turn just an instrument to complete his betrayal of Mr.House. Then he betrayed the Great Khans he had hired to help him kill the Courier, by slinking off just before they got cornered in an ambush. When you meat him at The Tops you have the option of talking to him in his room, and depending on how you handle things will either not show up in the room and sick some goons on you, or will make a very reasonable deal with you to give you a cut of the profits from his scheme to take over New Vegas, so long as you become his errand boy slash girl. However, when you report to work to do some fetch quests, you find he has run off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> dialogue reveals he would have tried to kill you again after you saved him at the Legion camp.
<ul><li> The Courier can also engage in chronic backstabbing; helping the Powder Gangers wipe out Goodsprings, then betraying them to the NCR, then switching sides to the Legion in the second act, bombing the Monorail and wiping out Camp Forlorn Hope, followed by upgrading the Securitrons and having the Khans break their alliance with the Legion, killing Caesar, and finally offing Mr. House and installing Yes Man in the Lucky 38, proceeding to a chaotic independent Vegas.
</li><li> Every deal made by Caesar's Legion is done in bad faith. The Legion doesn't have allies, just prospective slaves and enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Nipton</a> falls to this, Ulysses' Tribe fell victim to this, the White Legs fell victim to this, and potentially the Great Khans can fall to this unless you find some way to cancel their alliance with the Legion. Allying with the NCR in the end-game and setting up alliances with all the minor factions of the Mojave creates a beautiful Aesop: no matter how powerful, numerous or ruthless you are, you can't win if you alienate everyone else to the point where they gang up on you.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has multiple backstabbing opportunities, such as helping Mr. Burke nuke Megaton, then turning Roy Philips and his fellow feral ghouls loose on Tenpenny Tower; rescuing the Big Town captives from the Super Mutants only to sell Red into slavery immediately after; rescuing the Little Lamplight residents from Paradise Falls followed by enslaving Bumble; self-destructing President Eden and Raven Rock but infecting Project Purity with the Modified FEV anyway; and finally, capturing Adams Air Force Base from the Enclave followed by calling an orbital strike on the Brotherhood of Steel's Citadel.

Then Darkseid betrays Brainiac by using a Mother Box to take control of him in a bid to discover the Anti-Life Equation and rewrite the universe.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Deuce</span> from the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed">Loonatics Unleashed</a></em>. There isn't a single alliance he makes that isn't simply one of convenience and broken as soon as he has what he wants from it.
</li><li> All three of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">The Eds</a> are this to each other in some degree.
<ul><li> Ed is more downplayed, as episodes have shown him joining the other kids to laugh at either Edd or Eddy's humiliation, and more often than not has he helped Eddy play cruel pranks on Edd ("My Fair Ed" being the most blatant example as the two deliberately got Edd in trouble with the other kids while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification">shrugging it off as a joke</a>). Of course, this is just more out of Ed being an idiot and/or Eddy's parrot than deliberate disloyalty.
</li><li> Edd also has his moments of this, particularly in the season where they go to school. He was willing to betray his friends through following school regulations, such as hand-delivering his friends' report cards to their parents (sure Eddy deserved it for not doing his work, but Edd failed to take notice on how dim Ed is to function in school and therefore needs counseling since his parents are no help). Of course, it's mostly when he is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">blinded by authority</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">when Eddy really pushes him over the limit, thus causing Edd to teach him a lesson the hard way.</a>
</li><li> Eddy is easily the biggest backstabber of the three, as more often than not he is willing to succeed at the expense of his friends (with "Pick an Ed" being the most egregious example of them all).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> While not as bad as Heather, Courtney too has her fair share of betrayals throughout the series, ranging from friends, enemies and even love interests:
<ul><li> In the special for <em>Island</em>, Courtney briefly teams with Duncan but after she manages to retrieve the money and Duncan is injured, she instantly abandons him without missing a beat.
</li><li> Near the end of <em>All-Stars</em>, Courtney plans to betray Gwen some way along the way despite their promise to go the finale together. Instead, she plans to bring her new boyfriend, Scott, with her, believing that he will throw the match for her. Unfortunately for her, Mal reveals her plan to the others before she could carry it out. What makes her horrible is that after giving all sorts of crap to Gwen for her own betrayal two seasons ago, Courtney was all too happy to do the same.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the only way Heather got to the final rounds more than once. However, it's also been known to backfire on her and has done so twice. Lindsay and Beth, two victims of Heather's abuse still won't associate with her after <em>Island</em>. She also failed this in <em>World Tour</em>, having her hands on the money for all of three seconds before losing it and ending up with nothing.
</li><li> In <em>Revenge of the Island</em>, Scott constantly sabotages his team, so he can eliminate any possible threats and lull the other team into a false sense of security. Halfway through the season, Chris, who is the host puts him on the other team... and he starts sabotaging his new team's efforts instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Turns into a running gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em> with Penny's so-called friends ditching her whenever she's really in a pickle (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">including</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Zoey</a>). The worst of them all, however, is easily Dijonay, who was once even willing to sell out Penny to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gross Sisters</a></em>.
</li><li> Dodie Bishop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em> may as well be considered the Caucasian version of the aforementioned Dijonay Jones up above. Whenever she wants to gain popularity of some sort, she'll see it as an opportunity to stab Ginger and Macie in the back each and every time. You know you're considered a bad friend when even arguably the most popular girl in school treats your friend much better than you do.
</li><li> Apocalypse from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> animated series has a habit of making promises to people and then breaking them at the worst possible moment. He promised Deathbird he would kill her sister, only to kidnap one of Lilandra's telepaths instead; when Deathbird reminded Apocalypse he said he would destroy Lilandra, he simply replied "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I Lied</a>". He tricked the Friends of Humanity into helping and dispersing a plague for him, then planned to discard them as soon their usefulness had ended. He lied to Magneto about his intentions in regards to creating a reality where mutants ruled over humans, instead planning to destroy all of reality and remaking it in his image, though Magneto saw this betrayal coming.
</li><li> Trevor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sidekick">Sidekick</a></em>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">he prefers to be evil rather than a hero</a>. To be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">his friends aren't so much better than him</a>...
</li><li> Aku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> loves to spread misery and pain, and what better way than to betray a close ally at an inopportune moment? A standout example is "Jack and the Ultra-Robots"; Aku forces a scientist to build a new line of killbots in exchange for the safety of his village, but as soon as they are finished he orders the Ultra-Robots to destroy the village as a "test run". This comes back to screw him over when said scientist helps Jack defeat the Ultra-Robots.
</li><li> Croc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DofusTheTreasuresOfKerubim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DofusTheTreasuresOfKerubim">Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim</a></em> has this as a literal disorder. He is incapable of not betraying anyone he works with even when it harms him too. He does not mean it, and apologizes afterwards, which is probably why Croc's friends do not hold it against him. Also, his betrayals often end up helping his friends inadvertently in the end.
</li><li> This is Monstroso's M.O. on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros">The Venture Bros.</a></em> He, being a supervillain lawyer, is also known as the "king of the doublecross." This doublecrossing is actually <em>encouraged</em> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">Guild of Calamitous Intent</a>. In his debut episode, he works with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Monarch</a> to torment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Dr. Venture</a> by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">litigation and paperwork</a> to seize Dr. Venture's estate, fully planning to backstab the Monarch and seize <em>his</em> estate as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lotor has thus far betrayed his father, by going behind his back to proceed with his secret plans and later killing him, and his generals by straight-up murdering one of them.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His generals aren't much better. First they basically betray the empire by helping Lotor, then they betray Lotor due to the abovementioned straight-up murder, then they betray Haggar to help Lotor again, then they betray Lotor, AGAIN, when he turns psycho, and when the empire is scattered and they are sovereign warlords Acxa betrays the other two for good measure.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>: Dale Gribble is a paranoid, gun-toting idiot who only trusts a handful of people, and even those people get the shit-end of the stick from his behavior quite often. It's difficult to count the number of times he has sold out his friends for personal gain or even threatened/attempted (horribly) to kill them at various points. How anyone puts up with him is a mystery.
