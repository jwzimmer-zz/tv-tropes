Nothing wrong with that. However, on your wedding day, when you meet her father, you remember that he's the guy who failed you in biology in the twelfth grade. Okay, odd, but not inconceivable. But wait, isn't her mother the one who sat next to you at a bus station five years ago and gave you great life advice? And her cousin looks familiar, too. Hold on, it seems you've met her entire family at one point or another throughout your entire life.
</p><p>And then she comes up to you and reveals that she's met <em>your</em> whole family before as well. In fact, you are her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate</a>.

<ul><li> In the third series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> several important antagonists have a connection with Dr. Tenma, who is ascended into the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. In the original manga, they are completely unrelated characters starred in each independent episodes, but in this series they are all parts of Tenma's greater scheme involving Astro.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NetojuuNoSusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NetojuuNoSusume">Netojuu No Susume</a></em> Yuta Sakurai becomes best friends with Moriko Morioka in an MMO. It turns out he has a friend at work who used to talk to Moriko on the phone a lot for business reasons. Yuta was very impressed by a personnel manual Moriko wrote back then. He runs into her by accident in a convenience store, where they both want the last piece of chicken. Much later, they collide by a street corner where he accidentally knocks her unconscious with his elbow. His friend from work ALSO has a chance encounter with Moriko, recognizes her voice from back then and asks her out. And ... it just so happens that Yuta and Moriko used to be best friends in <em>another</em> MMO, many years back. And the student behind the counter in the convenience store? He's Yuta's and Moriko's guild leader in the game. This in a country of 127 million people.
</li><li> The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, about a disowned prince rebelling against an empire, despite its incredibly large cast, features a great degree of connectedness. The protagonist, Lelouch, has more half siblings than he can count (since his father is an emperor with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> wives), at least five of which are important to the plot. His father is the primary villain of the series. He and his sister spent time, as children, in the Kururugi household, giving him a personal relationship with his rival, an important businessman, a legendary general, and a girl who will later become an enthusiastic fan of his alter ego. The president of the student council at his school is from a noble family that were supporters of his mother. A military officer he disgraces turns out to have formerly been a guard at his mansion. A Japanese citizen who becomes an important supporter of his rebellion turns out to have been his maid, and also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">ninja</a>. <br/><br/>Should note that Lelouch and Suzaku's relationship is <em>central</em> to the series, not just a coincidence (check how the beginning and ending revolve around <em>their</em> relationship), and both are royalty — Lelouch literally, Suzaku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic">more or less</a> - so it's no surprise that they're well-connected. Anya and Jeremiah are where they are due to the same thing that connects them to Lelouch - Anya <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets the piloting ability to be a Knight of the Rounds <em>because</em> she's possessed by Marianne</span>, and Jeremiah and pretty much everyone else who cared about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marianne, or Lelouch and Nunnally, came to Area 11 specifically because Lelouch and Nunnally had supposedly died there - including Clovis, as revealed in an audio drama</span>. Lloyd <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets engaged to Milly</span> <em>because</em> the Ashford family has Marianne's knightmares, which they have because they were connected to her, which is also the reason they took in Lelouch and Nunnally. Legitimate coincidences include Euphie meeting Suzaku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute">unless she planned it that way</a>, Lloyd meeting Suzaku, Villetta - Jeremiah's second - getting her Knightmare stolen, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being rescued by Ohgi</span>, Lelouch's classmate Nina being the one to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> invent Britannia's superweapon</span>, and a few others - plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> to go around for both protagonists. But the level of connectedness in general is pretty typical of monarchies, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>: In the first episode, Kira finds himself opposing Athrun, his best friend from the colonies. But before that, he runs into an unknown girl who later joins the crew of the Archangel — Cagalli. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And she turns out to be his sister.</span> Later on, the Archangel comes across an escape pod from a destroyed ZAFT vessel, containing none other than Lacus Clyne, Athrun's fiancee. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the end of the first season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity">be damned</a>, Kira is romantically attached to Lacus, and Athrun to Cagalli.</span> And their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>, Mwu la Fllaga, has an ongoing feud with Athrun's commanding officer, Rau le Creuset, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who turns out to be Mwu's father's clone. And the guy who ran the project? The one who eventually genetically modified Kira to be the Ultimate Coordinator.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some even theorize that the guy who ran the project (and is thus Kira and Cagalli's dad), Dr. Hibiki, may have used Al da Flaga's DNA in the Ultimate Coordinator project, adding yet <em>another</em> attachment.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> It seems that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo">ef - a fairy tale of the two.</a></em>, everyone is tied to each other through their past and present. Episode 10 of <em>a tale of melodies</em> best emphasizes this, as nearly the entire cast comes up in name or on screen.
</li><li> Almost all of the main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> are connected to Chrono in some way, and through him to each other. Chrono met Rosette and her brother, Joshua, when they woke him up from a long sleep in a tomb. Joshua was then kidnapped by Aion, Chrono's former friend. Chrono and Rosette join the Magdalan Order to try to find Joshua based on advice from Father Remington, a man who was trying to convince Joshua to join the Order because of his powers. Remington was also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mary Magdalene's guard in the Order when Chrono kidnapped her back in 1870. The Elder was her foster father of sorts.</span> During their search for Joshua, Chrono and Rosette run into Azmaria, who has powers startlingly similar to Joshua <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because they're both Apostles</span>. They all start to look for Joshua together, and run into a "jewel witch" named Satella. Satella is searching for a missing family member, and finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her sister, Florette, has become Fiore, Joshua's maid and a servant of Aion.</span> Pretty much the only characters that don't have a strong connection to Chrono, Rosette or Aion are Sister Kate (Rosette's commander in the Order) and Father Gilliam, an ally of Chrono and Rosette's in the order.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, most of the characters have heard of Nobuhiro "Taro Kawaguchi" Mashiro, the mangaka uncle of the main character and some of the editors have worked with him (Editor in Chief Sasaki, for example, was the one who told him Shonen Jump wouldn't renew his contract). In a later arc of the series, Azuma, an out-of-work mangaka, happens to be Nobuhiro's assistant. Outside of the manga industry, Kaya's father was friends with Nobuhiro in school, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">the woman Nobuhiro loved happens to be the mother of the girl Moritaka loves</a>.

The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">copycat</span> victim Shougo is running against the third victim (Yuuichi) for student council president. Yuuichi is being tutored by the fourth victim (Harumi), who has an alter ego Maria that works as a prostitute, and one of her clients is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">second copycat</span> victim Hirukawa. Hirukawa's daughter Taeka is the fifth victim.

</li><li> In <em>Ichinensei Ni Nacchattara</em>, the main character Iori just happens to have his life saved by the sister of his oblivious crush, at the cost of being turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">a seven-year-old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">girl</a>, which causes him to be sent to the same school as the kid whom he risked <em>his</em> life to save. By pure coincidence, his younger sister attends that school as well.

</li><li> Nearly every main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has a connection to others.
<ul><li> The Pirate King Gol D. Roger left his mark <em>everywhere</em>. Even twenty years after his death his influence still seems to reach every corner of the world. Just among the Straw Hat crew, Luffy (unknowingly) wears the hat Roger wore in his youth, his hero Shanks served on Roger's ship, his grandfather was Roger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">greatest rival</a>, he was trained by Roger's first mate during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, and his adoptive brother Ace is Roger's biological son. Shortly before the main story began, Jimbei had befriended Ace when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">they stalemated after a five-day battle</a>. Franky's sensei was the one who built Roger's ship, the Oro Jackson. Brook had befriended the man who would become the Pirate King's onboard doctor, Crocus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Usopp's father serves as the sharpshooter</a> in Shanks' crew, who apprenticed on Roger's crew. The first real pirate antagonist the crew encountered, Buggy the Clown, also apprenticed on Roger's ship alongside Shanks. Robin's goal to discover the "true" history of the world and learn about the events of the "Void Century" has already been completely uncovered by Roger and his crew years ago. The connections just go on and on.
</li><li> This is especially evident in the Dressrosa arc, where many of the participants in the Tournament <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Ace's devil fruit</span> have a connection to characters that connect them to Luffy.
</li><li> Also in the Dressrosa arc we learn that Law's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Donquixote Rosinante</span> doesn't only connect him to Doflamingo, but also to Sengoku, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rosinante was Sengoku's adopted son</span>. This in turn connects Law to Luffy, as Sengoku and Garp are friends.
</li><li> In the Reverie arc, many people whom the Straw Hat met throughout their journey meet up with each other discussing about their common friend. This ranges from Vivi, the Neptune Family, Riku Family, Coby, the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, Dalton and Doctor Kureha.
</li><li> Also during the Reverie arc, as well as the subsequent Wano arc, the existence of a near-mythical crew "Rocks Pirates" is brought up - and what do you know, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">virtually every present-day character that was a pirate in those days was either a part of the crew (Whitebeard, Kaido, Big Mom, Shiki, John, Bakkin supposedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Shakky perhaps</a>), or in opposition of them (Gold Roger and - presumably - his own crew). Many of the modern-day big names, such as Shanks and Blackbeard, were then directly connected to one of the afore-mentioned people. It really seemed like the focal point of the entire recent One Piece history</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost all the main cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NukoDuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NukoDuke">Nuko Duke</a></em> has some connection to each other. Everyone in the city (including animals) know who Yuuya is due to his constant job-changing and his habit of sleeping wherever he wants. Whenever a new character is introduced, it's always someone he already knows, such as Yamato (his best friend), Haruki (his younger brother), Kana (his pet's twin sister), Inori (his girlfriend) and Kana's owners (Inori's father and cousin).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan">Himouto! Umaru-chan</a></em>, Umaru's friends Kirie and Sylphin have big brothers too; they all work for the same company, are friends with Umaru's brother Taihei, and they eventually befriend Umaru themselves without any influence from their sisters. The odd one out is Umaru's friend Ebina, whose older brother ran away from home when she was little — but he turns up in one story arc where Taihei has a business trip and they end up working at the same restaurant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine">Love Live! Sunshine!!</a></em>, it turns everyone in Aqours besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">Riko</a> know each other from the past, thanks to the abundance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a>. Justified in this case, as the cast all live in a small beachside town.
</li><li> Many of the new characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> are somehow connected to the old cast(s). Yukizome was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher">Cool Teacher</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2">Super Danganronpa 2</a></em> cast, Kizakura was Jin Kirigiri's best friend, Sakakura was the head of security at Hope's Peak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and inadvertently helped motivate Hinata to become Izuru Kamukura</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Andou, Izayoi and Kimura</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> were expelled thanks to Komaeda's efforts to get the school exams cancelled</span>, and Mitarai was not only a member of Class 77-B, but a close friend of the Imposter and Tsumiki <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as well as Junko Enoshima's unwilling accomplice</span>. Even Hinata, who was the least connected to Class 77-B, gains a few extra connections by having him not only become friends with Natsumi Fuyuhiko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the day before she died</span>, but also with Chiaki <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before <em>she</em> dies in real life as well</span>. And <em>every</em> character, in all the games, has either attended Hope's Peak at some point or is directly related to someone who did.
<ul><li> Even the spinoffs aren't immune: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillerKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillerKiller">Killer Killer</a></em>, Hijirihara and the rest of Division 6 run into former Hope's Peak accolade Juzo during a underground colosseum bust, and both Hijirihara <em>and</em> the main villain got their love of killing from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seeing Mukuro slaughter their school.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, despite Kyon being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">completely, explicitly</a> unconnected to any of the weirdness going on, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> turns out to be the previous <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">holder of an incredible unique power</span> whose next inheritor Kyon would befriend, solely by chance, several years later. Most other examples of the trope are justified in that they result from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haruhi being God and unconsciously warping the universe to be more fantastical</span>, but this example she has absolutely nothing to do with. It's just how the dice fell.
</li><li> Yuuto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonariNoKashiwagiSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonariNoKashiwagiSan">Tonari no Kashiwagi-san</a></em> ended having a connection with the Kashiwagi family even before he becomes friends with Kotone. For one thing, Kotone is secretly his favorite online artist Sayane. For another, Kotone's older sister Kotori is the boss at his new job. Also, Tina's boyfriend turns out to have been the boy that caused Kotone to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek">Closet Geek</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>, Kobayashi's boss is an old friend of Tohru's father, and his son Shouta ends up summoning Tohru's friend Lucoa as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar">Familiar</a>. Taken even further in the anime, when it turns out that Shouta attends the same elementary school as Kanna and Saikawa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls">Comic Girls</a></em> has three recurring adults: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble">Four-Girl Ensemble</a>'s landlady, teacher and editor (as they are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialArtist">Sequential Artists</a>). It turns out they were high school classmates, and joined the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSchoolClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSchoolClub">Japanese School Club</a>. When Miharu finds out that some of students<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dpfw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dpfw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dpfw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kaos, Ruki and Tsubasa are in Miharu's homeroom, while Koyume is in a different class</span>, she's surprised, and a bit annoyed with Ririka for not telling her earlier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, most of the main cast, is closely connected. Yuu shares a class with her two closest friends, Koyomi and Akari. Yuu also works for the student council, with her literature teacher, Riko Hakozaki as the club advisor, and Koyomi helps out by writing a play for them. Some of the characters in both groups hang out at a local café, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the manager of which is in a relationship with Riko</span>. Riko's colleague from her theater troupe comes to help coach the student council, and turns out to have known Touko's older sister while they were in high school. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The theatre troupe also ends up recruiting Touko after the play</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> is a long-running mystery series where backstories are usually key revelations—but most of the time, good and bad guys alike are secretly intimately connected to a ridiculous degree, often by complete coincidence. For example, here are instances of this trope regarding only the odd connections of Kudou Shinichi, the main protagonist: Early in the series, Shinichi finds a rival in Kaitou KID, a thief he'd never heard of prior to encountering him during a "joke" heist, and whose true identity he still does not know. But despite their meeting being completely coincidental, with neither having any knowledge of any personal connections, KID's father was Shinichi's mother's mentor and Shinichi's father's rival and best friend, and in the thief's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito">own series' anime adaptation</a>, Shinichi's surrogate uncle, Agasa, is heavily implied to be the long-time friend of Jii, KID's surrogate grandfather, as well as the unwitting supplier of the gear Jii gives KID to help with his heists. Further, despite Shinichi's encounter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">the Black Organization</a> being pure bad luck, ex-member Haibara's seeking him out for protection being completely unrelated to who Shinichi actually is, and the Black Org having no idea Kudo Shinichi is even still alive to be involved in any of this, the assassin sent after Haibara is the best friend of Shinichi's mother, a friendship she made during her mentorship under Kaito's father. Not only that, but it's the same assassin whose life Shinichi and Ran completely coincidentally encountered and saved while said assassin was undercover as an alleged serial killer, completely ignorant of her real appearance or identity, ties to Shinichi's family, or the Black Org. And after saving that "serial killer," they encounter Akai Shuichi, the FBI agent who would later partner with Shinichi after Shinichi, again entirely by coincidence, gets himself involved with the Black Org. As it turns out, Shinichi randomly met the entire Akai family (sans the father) when he was on a family beach trip as a child before any of this happened, and became Akai Shuichi's little sister's inspiration to be a detective. This just covers a few connections with <em>the main character.</em> The extended cast's connections are just as crazy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> the ninja community, particularly at the higher levels of skill, is pretty small. That, and data gathering and dissemination through "bingo books" so ninja don't get taken unaware by their enemies, means that every high level ninja has likely at least heard of every other one. As for personal connections, there are many. For example, the titular character is mentored by Kakashi Hatake who's father Sakumo killed the parents of Sasori. Sasori would go on to join the terrorist organization Akatsuki, who's numbers include Itachi Uchiha, the brother of one of Kakashi's other students, Sasuke. Sasori's previous partner in Akatsuki was Orochimaru, the former teammate of Jiraya, who mentored both Akatsuki's founders and Minato Namikaze, who would himself mentor Kakashi.
</li><li> It's established very early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> that there was only a single student in Japan to have scored higher than Shirogane on the national mock exams, a boy by the name of Mikado Shijo. It's later revealed that Mikado is the twin brother of Shirogane's classmate (and later friend) Maki, which also means that he's the cousin of Shirogane's crush Kaguya. Whether or not Shirogane is aware of this connection is unknown.

<ul><li> Of course in this case it makes no logical sense whatsoever. For example: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hulk is revealed to have killed Peter Parker's parents even though canonically Spiderman was already a superhero in the UMU when Banner became the Hulk</span>.
<ul><li> Quite frankly, anything and everything Bendis established in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvelTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvelTeamUp">Ultimate Marvel Team-Up</a></em> was either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> away or blatantly ignored almost as soon as the series was published.

Four villains like Doctor Doom and Galactus became Marvel-wide villains, and they were also a major part of Spider-Man's early era, showing up on Issue 1 and then recurring later, with Peter even tussling with Dr. Doom and for the longest time counting Johnny Storm as his best friend in the superhero community.

Her successor, Jenny Quantum, will presumably be the same for the 21st century.

The previous generation pulls double duty when you remember that Hay Lin's grandmother Yan Lin was also one of the previous team (in fact there's the chance Hay Lin did meet Kadma and Halinor), and was keeping tabs on the future Guardians through her fellow former Guardians.

Several members of the cast (Chromedome, Drift, Ratchet, Skids and Whirl) turn out to be in one way or another connected to each other as part of a story involving a faked terrorist plot and a heist. Through the story, there are several other cameos and connections to other major characters, chief among them Orion Pax, Prowl and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shockwave</span>.

Their father, Taringail Damodred, is a relative of Moiraine Damodred (whose cousin, Caraline Damodred, also appears in the series). Galad's mother, Tigraine Mantear, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also the mother of the main character, Rand al'Thor</span>. Meanwhile, the mother of Elayne and Gawyn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had an affair with Thom Merrilin, her court-bard-turned-wandering-gleeman, who likely killed Taringail</span>. Gawyn is now (sort of) romantically involved with Egwene al'Vere, who was Rand's love interest back in the first three books, while Rand is now involved with Elayne.

In this series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllShareMyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllShareMyStory">They All Share The Story</a>. The mariner Bayle Domon, for example, helped Rand and Mat escape monsters in book one, helped Elayne and Nynaeve hunt the Black Ajah in book four, and traveled with Mat in books eight through 12 or so.

Orb's child with Mym (Mars, Incarnation of War), is Orlene (God(dess), Incarnation of Good). Orlene once dated Norton (Chronos, Incarnation of Time), and bore a child (who later died). Niobe's granddaughter, Luna (via Niobe's son from her first marriage), is dating Zane (Thanatos, Incarnation of Death). Kerena (Nox, Incarnation of Night) is a distant ancestor of Orlene's dead husband, and accidentally introduced into her line the curse that would kill Orlene's child. Parry's demon ex-lover, Lilith, is a concubine of Mym. Another Aspect of Fate, Nicolai (Atropos), is a friend of Orb and helped find an adoptive family for Orlene. There's also a very strong hint on the first page of <em>Under a Velvet Cloak</em> that Kerena's sister Katherine is a distant ancestor of Niobe, thus also of Orb, Luna, and Orlene.</span>

</li><li> All the character connections are shown on <a class="urllink" href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Connections">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with <a class="urllink" href="http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/lostpedia/images/6/6c/Lostconnections.gif">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> rather impressive graphic.
</li><li> In Seasons 1-3 such connections only occurred every other few episodes. By the time of Season Six all pretenses are dropped and <em>each</em> episode features cross-character connection at a rate of about once every 15 minutes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashSideways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashSideways">Flash Sideways</a>.
<ul><li> Well, by the end of season 3, they'd <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stopped doing flashbacks at all. They didn't dip back into the past, so it makes sense that the rest of the show would feature the main characters encountering each other. And the Flash Sideways was some sort of mystical alternate dimension engineered specifically to create this sort of thing.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> uses this trope in the first season when showing events in the Enchanted Forest. But then it wholly embraces it in the second season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after we find out that the majority of the main cast are all related in some way</span>. Unsurprising, since it's written by the same team that did "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a>".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, during the last season, The Mother makes her appearance; but as it turns out, Ted is the last one of his group to meet her. She first meets Barney, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and convinces him to go after Robin</span>, then befriends Lily on a train, then Marshall by giving him a ride, then Robin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by stopping her from running away on her wedding day</span>, and lastly, she meets Ted. When he reveals to them he met her, Lily and Marshall even state how great she is and Barney tried to introduce them at the start of the last episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> is a user of this trope as well, though to a lesser extent than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, with even some characters saying, "We're all connected."
<ul><li> Though considering that many of the characters are the children of the founders of The Company or were manipulated by it, this doesn't seem too implausible.
</li><li> And the writers of doing a pretty good job of remembering that not <em>everyone</em> has met <em>everyone</em>. For example, it took two full seasons for Matt and Hiro to meet:
<div class="indent"><em>(Nathan and Matt arrive at Primatech Paper)</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hiro:</strong> <em>(seeing Nathan)</em> Flying man!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Matt:</strong> Who is this kid?
</div><ul><li> The same thing happens with Claire and Hiro, and they have a whole episode centering around it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> of how they never met each other.
</li><li> Technically, they <em>have</em> met. However, how was Hiro supposed to recognize a toddler he probably didn't even look up to see (he was buried in a handheld video game) when he was little?
</li></ul></li><li> Though they sometimes slip up-like how Nathan in early season 2 seemed to have forgotten meeting almost <em>everyone</em>, even people he met before the events of the finale.
</li><li> On a related note, the fact that new Petrellis keep cropping up certainly implies this.
</li><li> Charles Deveaux is never actually seen doing anything while he's alive. He's shown unconscious a couple of times, once in Peter's dream, and then he's dead. He seems to be unimportant; just a plot mechanism to connect Simone and Isaac to the Petrellis. But after his death Charles become increasingly important, until by Volume 4 it's revealed that he was the leading founder of the Company.
<ul><li> Ditto Linderman to an extent. Initially he just seems to be a powerful mobster who has very generic interests. While there are a few hints that there is more to his character while he's alive, we don't really begin to find out about him until after he dies.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest">Manifest</a></em> has a plane taking off in 2013 but when it lands, the passengers are stunned to find it's now 2018. As they handle the changes to the world and their lives, it becomes clear odd connections are happening to link them together.
<ul><li> Saanvi was young doctor who was working on a breakthrough leukemia treatment. She discovers the treatment is now implemented and working great on patients...one of whom is Cal, a young boy who was on the plane and would have died in 2013 but now can be cured.
</li><li> Ben helps fellow passenger Radd when the latter's son is arrested for robbery. Ben is checking out a storage locker of mementos owned by a man who was dating Ben's "widow" Grace. While there, Ben runs into the son of the owner of the store outside a locker filled with the stolen goods. The guy had robbed the place himself and set up Radd's son and was planning to sell the stuff off when Ben found him.
</li><li> Michela listens to a "voice" that tells her to free a lost dog. It turns out that the owner happens to have abducted two young girls.
</li><li> Michela investigates the murder of a passenger who had a necklace stolen. Later, Michela saves the mother of a late friend from being hit by a car. When Michela checks on the driver, she recognizes her as that passenger's maid with the necklace right in plain sight and realizes she's the killer.
</li><li> While working different cases, Michela and Saanvi manage to come together to aid a flight attendant from the plane in finding a lost stowaway.
</li><li> It's openly addressed by the characters that this all goes beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> and instead indicates some sort of design is at work.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> did this in the episode "Heroic Origins" as a parody of this trope's prevalence in works like <em>LOST</em> and <em>Heroes</em>. Turns out and Jeff helped break up Shirley's marriage, Abed got Annie arrested for her pill addiction, Shirley accidentally got Dean Pelton to embrace his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser">Creepy Crossdresser</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> tendencies, etc.
<ul><li> Specifically, Abed is shown to be the one character who had a hand in bringing everyone together. He compares himself to the villain of their superhero origin story. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it turns out Chang, of all people, helped out as well.</span>

</li><li> <em>The Class</em> did this. A group of eight adults who were in the same third grade class spontaneously be re-involved with each other lives, both intimately and in passing.
</li><li> <em>Six Degrees</em> did the same with a more serious tone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> got hit with a boatload of this in the time-travel episode. Every character happened to have been at the same club on the same night, and several of them had brief encounters that they had presumably forgotten about the next time they met. This includes their social worker and his girlfriend, who became his fiancee that night, but he didn't have an engagement ring because Kelly and her boyfriend just so happened to break into their car and steal it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou">Mad About You</a></em> discussed this when Jamie got pregnant - they wanted to tell everybody in Thanksgiving, Paul pointed out it would be leaked and spread before the date because people they know usually know each other, using the Bacon numbers as a reference. And in the end of the episode, one person appears to congratulate on the pregnancy... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinBacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinBacon">Kevin Bacon</a> himself!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chandler's connection to the group started off simply as "Monica's neighbour", but the writers later added that he had also been Ross college roommate, met Monica and Rachel several times and spent regular Thanksgivings with the Geller family. He only became Monica's neighbour because she tipped him off about the available apartment next to hers.
</li><li> Phoebe, who first met the group through being Monica's roommate, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">mugged</a> Ross when they were teenagers.

<div class="indent"><strong>Phoebe</strong>: I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, y'know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I've always felt kinda like an outsider, y'know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back. And now you and I have a great one!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Ross</strong>: It's not the best!
</div></li><li> After Ross sleeps with Chloe the girl from the Xerox place, Chandler and Joey advise him to work out "the Trail" of people who know what he's done and could potentially tell Rachel before he can do it himself. They work out that Chloe works with Isaac whose sister, Jasmine, works with Phoebe. Ross begs Jasmine not to tell Phoebe, only for her to reveal that her roommate is Gunther, the manager of Central Perk, who has an unrequited crush on Rachel. By the time Ross gets to the coffee shop, Gunther has already told Rachel everything.

On <em>Island of the Idols</em>, Dean Kowalski's ex-girl friend whom he dated for six years is one of Kellee Kim's really good friends and classmates at Wharton's business school. In <em>Gabon</em>, Crystal Cox's cousin is one of Marcus Lehman's really close friends. The most noteworthy example, however, is probably in <em>Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers</em> where Ali Elliott and Patrick Bolton were part of the same friend group at Auburn during college. Patrick even helped Ali move her stuff into her apartment, and they happened to get cast on the same tribe together (unintentionally on casting's part).
</li><li> This is a major recurring element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Touch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Touch">Touch</a></em>, which is unsurprising, given that it has the same creator as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. Seemingly unconnected or disparate characters will often turn out to be connected in some way, which fits with the show's themes of fate and divine providence.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernLove">Modern Love</a></em>.

<ul><li> The formation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTravelingWilburys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTravelingWilburys">The Traveling Wilburys</a> musical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">supergroup</a> would likely have been dismissed as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> if it didn't actually happen. The story goes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> and producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Jeff Lynne</a>, who were working on an album together, met up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a> for dinner one night, and when they finished Harrison realised that he'd left his guitar at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty">Tom Petty</a>'s house and went to collect it. While they were there, Petty suggested that they use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s home recording studio to work on the album, since Harrison's own home studio was back in England. Petty tagged along with the others to Dylan's house, and all the assembled musicians decided that since they already were hanging out together, they might as well jam together. The product of that session ended up resulting in their first single, which they decided was so good that it could go on it's own album, and since they had so much fun together...
</li><li> The instrumental rock scene of the 1960s might count. Many of the surf musicians in Southern California knew each other. The Ventures and The Fabulous Wailers both came from the Seattle area and knew each other, even releasing a joint album in 2009. The Ventures had also collaborated with instrumental rock guitarist Duane Eddy. Over in Europe, two of the most popular instrumental rock groups, The Shadows and The Spotnicks, had met and even had a jam session. The Ventures' rhythm guitarist Don Wilson has met The Shadows' Bruce Welch. The late Ventures guitarist Nokie Edwards held a joint concert with Sponticks lead guitarist Bo Winberg. The Ventures also know Yuzo Kayama and Takeshi Terauchi, two of the most popular instrumental rock guitarists of the 1960s, with Yuzo Kayama having several joint concerts with The Ventures, Takeshi Terauchi joining The Ventures tour briefly when rhythm guitarist Don Wilson had a death in his family. Takeshi Terauchi also knows Nobuhiro Mine, who was the lead guitarist in another famous Japanese instrumental rock group of the 1960s, Munetaka Inoue &amp; Sharp Five.

<ul><li> This happens in wrestling by default, as a lot of wrestlers that worked together in the indies often find themselves working together and/or connected to other wrestlers when they move up to a bigger promotion such as the WWE.
</li><li> Today, the feud between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> is one of the personal rivalries in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> for the WWE, and one that dates back all the way to their days in the developmental territory FCW. This trope comes into play when you consider their history together in the indies — or, to be more specific, <em>lack of</em>. Jon Moxley and Tyler Black had wrestled and/or tagged with a lot of the same people. The most obvious connection would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a>, one of Mox's perennial rivals, a feud so brutal that it ended in an "I Quit" match, and Black's best friend/partner in the Age of the Fall up until the relationship soured thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries">Austin Aries</a> (who has also wrestled Mox in one of his last matches before leaving for the WWE). In spite of all that, Mox and Black would never cross paths in any capacity in the indies and wouldn't meet until FCW. The irony in all this is that when they did finally wrestle each other, the chemistry between them was absolutely amazing and led to some of the best matches in the history of FCW.

Ironically, this is one of the few times where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">characters turning out to be related</a> actually leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">happy ending</a>; it not only gives Jack a respectable background, but since he's the son of her beloved sister, Lady Bracknell can't very well object to him.

<ul><li> Start with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">¡Three Amigos!</a>, Sora, Riku, and Kairi, who were raised in Destiny Islands and want to explore other worlds. Sora is accompanied by Donald and Goofy, assistants and friends of King Mickey, who later helps Riku overcome darkness and becomes his friend. Late to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">I</a></em>, it is revealed that Kairi was originally from a place called Hollow Bastion, the homeworld of most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> characters, but also the game's main villain, Ansem, who briefly possesses Riku.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">II</a></em> reveals that the "Ansem" Sora defeated was not really Ansem, but was merely the Heartless of an impostor called Xehanort, who studied under the real Ansem, who is friends with Mickey. Xehanort's Nobody, Xemnas, is the leader of Organization XIII, whose members Sora battles one by one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Chain of Memories</a></em> and <em>II</em>. Six other members of the Organization are also Nobodies of Ansem's apprentices. One of them, Axel, is part of another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">¡Three Amigos!</a> with the Organization's two latest members: Roxas, Sora's Nobody; and Xion, Roxas' replica who looks like Kairi. Another Kairi lookalike is her Nobody, Naminé, who was born in Castle Oblivion, one of the Organization's bases.
</li><li> Roxas himself looks like another person, Ventus, a Keyblade wielder from a decade ago. As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em>, Ventus, a friend of Lea, Axel's human form, is the light counterpart of Vanitas, the source of the Unversed. Ventus' heart healed itself after the disastrous birth of Vanitas by merging with Sora (in the process giving Sora the ability to wield Keyblade) and that's why Vanitas looks like Sora and Roxas like Ventus. Said merging was under the watchful eyes of Master Xehanort, whom Ventus studied under. This Xehanort was not exactly the same as the current one; he was old and only gained his current form by possessing Ventus' friend, Terra. Terra once met Sora and Riku and was the person who granted Riku the ability to wield Keyblade. Terra and Ventus, by the way, are part of a third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">¡Three Amigos!</a>. The third member is Aqua, who created Castle Oblivion, granted Kairi the ability to wield Keyblade and a means to escape Hollow Bastion should it faced danger (hence why she ended up in Destiny Islands) and also met Sora and Riku; in particular, she gave Sora motivation to save his friends, kickstarting his adventurous personality. The amigos trained under Master Eraqus, Xehanort's blood brother. Coming full circle, Xehanort's homeworld is revealed to be Destiny Islands and the tale of his journey to become a Keyblade Master inspired Riku, leading him to suggest Sora and Kairi to leave the islands.
</li><li> Since, the story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX">χ</a></em> takes place hundreds of years before the main series, you'd expect them to have nothing to do with the present, right? Nope! Turns out Ventus came from this distant past and, as a Dandelion, was transported to the present day by the Foretellers so the arts of Keyblade would not be lost after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Keyblade War</a>. The Nobodies of two other Dandelions, Lauriam and Elrena, later became a part of the Organization (as Marluxia and Larxene, respectively). One of the Foretellers, Luxu, possessed a Keyblade that, after generations, eventually ended up in the hands of Master Xehanort.

In addition to this, the main prosecutor of this game, Simon Blackquill, was Metis' student in psychology and the brother of Metis' lab partner, Aura Blackquill. Simon was also falsely accused of Metis' murder.

The lowest? <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSteiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSteiger">Rod Steiger</a>, who can be connected to anyone else in Hollywood by an average of 2.11 degrees.
<ul><li> This, of course, led to games like 6 Degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinBacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinBacon">Kevin Bacon</a> and 6 Degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Hitler</a> (where you pick a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> page and follow page links until you get to Hitler's page.)
</li></ul></li><li> The professional sports version of this is a <a class="urllink" href="http://hfboards.com/showthread.php?t=512065">Sillinger number<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, after journeyman ice hockey player Mike Sillinger. No player in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">National Hockey League</a>'s more than 90-year history is more than six degrees from Sillinger, and at one point in the 2007-08 season, every single player in the then-30-team league had either played with Sillinger or had a teammate who had played with Sillinger. In case you're wondering, you can connect Sillinger to Kevin Bacon in four steps: Bacon was in <em>Sleepers</em> with Ron Eldard, who was in <em>Mystery, Alaska</em> with Tie Domi, who was on the Toronto Maple Leafs with Eric Lindros in 2005-06, and Lindros played with Sillinger on the Philadelphia Flyers from 1997-99.
</li><li> Another possible professional sports version, though it can't be worked out rigorously, was posited by veteran sportscaster Bob Costas in a 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> piece on Vin Scully, who at the time of publication was less than two weeks away from retiring from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> broadcast team... after having called Dodgers games since <em>1950</em>, when the team was still in Brooklyn.
<div class="indent">Six degrees of Kevin Bacon? It's probably two, and no more than three, degrees of Vin Scully — to connect you in some way to everything in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a> history. Everything. He had to have known somebody ... who knew Cy Young.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ec82');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ec82" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ec82');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Young's last game was in 1911, and he lived until 1955.</span> He had to have known somebody who probably met Ty Cobb.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122gnj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note122gnj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122gnj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who last played in 1928.</span> Ty Cobb lived until 1961. If he didn't know Walter Johnson, he sure as hell talked to somebody who batted against Walter Johnson.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13kb24');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13kb24" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13kb24');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Johnson's last game was in 1927; he died in 1946, before Scully started his broadcasting career.</span> ... So there is no significant baseball personage that Vin Scully either didn't know or potentially knew someone who knew them.
</div></li><li> In mathematics, the equivalent to the Bacon number is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdos_number">Erdos number<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Paul Erdős has Erdős number 0. Everyone else has an Erdős number one greater than the minimum Erdős number among the people with whom they've published a paper. So Erdős's coauthors have number 1, their coauthors have number 2, etc.
<ul><li> For those who have both published academic papers and appeared in film (a larger group than you might think), there's the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%C2%96Bacon_number">Erdős-Bacon number<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is exactly what it sounds like. The lowest known value is 3.
</li></ul></li><li> If you are in a career with a small enough population of occupants, especially one where they often get shuffled around to different locations (say, if you are a specialist in a small enough career field in the armed forces), you quickly find that everybody seems to know everybody else. Alternatively, if you have a job where you get to know a wide range of people (like, for example, a church minister, who often also works in multiple places over the years) you often run into people you know, or who know people you know, especially if you often do things that have some connection to your job in your free time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine">Michael Caine</a> claims that everyone he knew as a struggling actor in London during Sixties ended up becoming famous like him:
<div class="indent">I was friends with Stan Getz, and Lionel Bart, who wrote Oliver! The painter Francis Bacon lived next door. He always tried to get me into his studio to paint me, but he was very gay and I thought, Im not going up there. An actor called David Baron said he was going to write a play, and I said Id act in it. He called it The Room and he did it under his real name, Harold Pinter. In the sixties, everyone you knew became famous. My flatmate was Terence Stamp. My barber was Vidal Sassoon. David Hockney did the menu in a restaurant I went to. I didnt know anyone unknown who didnt become famous.
</div></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1285238/Engaged-couple-discover-paths-crossed-Disney-World-toddlers.html">This happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Alex and Donna Voutsinas, which they discovered after they got engaged and she was showing him family pictures.
</li><li> In talking to just about anyone over 40 involved in the boxing/fighting community in New York's Capital Region you might get the impression that everyone knew Mike Tyson before he was famous in one way or another. Ask around any gym in the area and there's a good chance someone trained with, promoted, interviewed, or fought Tyson before he was a household name.
</li><li> In the corporate world, government service or the miltiary, a low ranking employee or soldier may be only a few people away from the CEO, president, prime minister etc.
</li><li> Horst Rippert, the brother of German singer Ivan Rebroff, claimed he shot down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntoineDeSaintExupery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntoineDeSaintExupery">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a>'s plane during Saint-Exupéry's fatal last mission (both were pilots in World War Two: Rippert in the Luftwaffe, Saint-Exupéry in the Free France Air Force); there's no factual element to support this claim, though.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_Monopoly#Fraud">McDonald's Monopoly game scam<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was exposed when the FBI got a tip to look at the relationships between the various top prize winners. The agents soon discovered that most of the big winners were either related to each other or knew other winners. The odds of this happening naturally were astronomical. The masterminds behind the scam usually used people who were related by marriage and thus had different last names. This fooled the corporate executives running the promotion but was quickly exposed by the FBI investigation.
</li><li> This is, essentially, how Jewish Geography works. Since Ashkenazi Jewry started from a very small population base, and traditionally married within the group, it isnt uncommon for two people to suddenly discover (how) theyre related, or had family who lived in the same town.
</li><li> Actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesMarsden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesMarsden">James Marsden</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMarsden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMarsden">Jason Marsden</a> are not related in any way, but their wives are lifelong best friends.
