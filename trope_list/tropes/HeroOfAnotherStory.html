<ul><li> Uryu Ishida is the protagonist of the story of the Quincy Clan's rise and fall and his quest to reclaim his family's heritage. He serves as an important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> for Ichigo so his story runs parallel to, rather than within, the main plotline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the Thousand Year Blood War arc, he even becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">Unexpected Successor</a> to the Quincy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Emperor Yhwach</a>.</span>
</li><li> Toushirou Hitsugaya is a prodigy who rose to captain in record time. He gets an unusually well-developed personality and backstory separate from Ichigo's plotline. He also shares time with a gaggle of less powerful characters during the Soul Society arc, including childhood friend Momo and subordinate Rangiku. This group of characters has a <em>far</em> more personal connection to the bad guys than Ichigo does, and some of their stories play out while Ichigo is otherwise occupied before focus switches back to Ichigo for the final battle. Hitsugaya's history of unusual power at a young age and having to cope with the alienation it causes is even parallel to that of Aizen's: the difference between them being that Hitsugaya came through the other side having found a place, friends and allies, whereas Aizen felt so alienated, he turned his back on everyone and the world instead.
</li><li> Kisuke Urahara, as Ichigo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBacker">Mysterious Backer</a>, alludes to an extensive offscreen history of rivalry with Aizen, with Ichigo's involvement beginning only later. He's also got a decades-long history with Isshin and Ryuuken that is only explored in the Final Arc.
</li><li> Yamamoto was already a warrior of great renown <strong>2000</strong> years before the main story, and built much of the present Soul Society around himself. In particular he established the Shinigami Academy, which has trained the vast majority of Shinigami for the last 2000 years. His body is covered in a road map of old scars, each one of which presumably has a story behind it (we know the scars on his forehead do). Yamamoto's millennium-long struggle with Yhwach, the Quincy Emperor, gives the Thousand Year Blood War arc its name but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">mostly unexplained</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Chiaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates">Bodacious Space Pirates</a></em>. She has her ship that she works on with her dad, and does a lot things which often forces her to suffer from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> (despite appearing prominently in the opening and ending sequences). She also fills in for Marika's pirate role in some episodes while the real one is working on a more covert mission.
</li><li> Touya, the main characters brother, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, has some magical powers of his own that are distinct from his sisters, which allow him to deduce <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Sakura has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper">despite her attempts to keep it secret</a></span> as well as that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yukito and Mirror are not human</span>. He also has backstory with several other magical people, including Kaho and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yukito</span>, long before his sister found the Book of Clow, and towards the end he gets more character development than pretty much anyone except Sakura herself. Fans often joke that if he had been the Cardcaptor instead of Sakura, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">the series would be half its length</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Every time Gunha Sogiita is shown, he's fighting criminals, helping people, etc. Amusingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">he thinks he's the main character</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, and is completely unaware of the main plot.
</li><li> Mikoto Misaka, who is only around for a few episodes, gets her own show in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> had Ryo, a character with a fairly small role in the grand scheme of the Tamers story, but who was literally the hero of another story (a set of video games that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never released in the west</a>)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays">Dog Days</a></em>, most of the plot involves non-fatal sports-like "war" (where literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyCanDie">Nobody Can Die</a>) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> becoming "the Hero" while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a>. Two of the characters in that world, a samurai and ninja partner team (Lady Brioche and her subordinate Yukikaze), are hunters of monsters and demons. While two episodes of the plot deal with a similar entity, even the monster that main characters fight is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">redeemable</span> as opposed to the untold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> dealings they handle. They are polite and make gestures at helping the main characters, but it's clear they normally deal with things on a totally different level, and aren't nearly using their full abilities at the games the rest of the cast are playing.
</li><li> The Universal Survival Tournament in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> involves the champions of several universes taking place in a massive battle royal, where Goku and the gang are just one of the teams are involved. Naturally this means that heroes from the other universes are fighting for their own survival, such as the superheroic Pride Troopers of Universe 11, and the magical girl Kamikaze Fireballs of Universe 2. We're only given fleeting glimpses of their universes in the lead up to the tournament, but it's clear they all have other issues and adversaries to contend with in their own stories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou Emiya</span>, Miyu's older brother and the person who kick-started the plot by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sending her to Illya's world</span>.

Thing is, Hestia Familia isn't unique, and in fact are rookies, and there are plenty of adventurers besides Bell, each up to their own adventure of varying interest and excitement. Loki Familia in particular has their own spin-off series.

<ul><li> Kino meets a male counterpart; an exiled prince with a talking dog. They go their separate ways after one chapter. In the novels that the anime is based on he is one of the main heroes as he appears in stories of his own, all of which are narrated by his dog, Riku. This trope still does apply though, in that every once in awhile he will cross paths with Kino and these stories are never narrated by Riku and are told in third person, just like all the stories that focus on Kino. The same trope also applies to Shishou (or "master"), the woman who taught Kino and used to go on travels of her own. In the anime we only see her as an old woman, once in a flashback during the main 13 episodes and during the movie ~Life Goes On~, which is set during the time Kino is living with her, but the novels include stories about the travels of a much younger Shishou and her unnamed student.

</li><li> Chrono Harlaown starts out as one of the main characters but becomes a stronger and stronger version of this trope as the series goes on, culminating in his apparent leadership of a large portion of the TSAB's Navy but barely being a part of the story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">StrikerS</a></em>.

</li><li> There are also at least 3 other teams that we rarely see in the show, and they're all implied to be out fighting their own battles offscreen.
</li><li> Also Killer Bee, who was hated/feared as a child (due to having the 8-tails inside him) and is now a considered a hero in his village.
</li><li> Or even Kakashi during the 12 years in between Naruto's birth and the start of the story. We know that he went from being an undoubtedly heartbroken, traumatized teenager to a relatively well adjusted adult who is highly respected within the village. How did he become this man after losing everyone he loved? Why did he quit ANBU?
<ul><li> Fortunately for fans, the anime did run an arc detailing the life of Kakashi's missing years.
</li></ul></li><li> Hanabi, Hinata's younger sister, actually got a two episode anime-exclusive arc dealing with how she came to be the heiress to the Hyuga Clan. Parts of the story are actually flashbacks to earlier episodes (such as the Chūnin Exam arc) retold from Hanabi's perspective.

This differs from normal split up arcs because we don't get to see the crew's stories while they are away, it's just implied with sparse glimpses and tellings. However, in the anime, they each get episodes explaining this more in-depth every so often while the story still mainly follows Luffy. This stops at the Return to Shabody Arc.
</li><li> The Eleven Supernovas: they are all the rookie pirates that have started their journey through the Grand Line, but managed to amass serious bounties and by coincidence all happened to be on Shabaody at the same time. In total, they are nine pirate crews, including the protagonists<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ebjg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ebjg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ebjg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two of the Supernovas are subordinates of the others - Zoro to Luffy and Killer to Eustass Kidd</span>. They all had their offscreen journey, their wacky crews, their own dreams. During the arc, they all have their own battles with marine forces. During the time skip, they also continued to have their adventures in the New World and now that the Strawhats are heading there, the others are becoming plot important - Trafalgar Law achieved the title of Warlord of the Sea during the timeskip and now joins forces with Luffy to take down Doflamingo and then one of the Four Emperors. Eustass Kid (with Killer), Scratchman Appo and Basil Hawkins also allied themselves to take down another. Jewelry Bonney had an unfortunate run-in with Blackbeard and Akainu, but managed to escape. The rest haven't appeared as of yet, but are expected to show up at some point as well.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Red-Haired Shanks</a> and his crew, who've been going on adventures since before the beginning of the story and still do so while playing a major part in the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. At this point in the story, Shanks is one of the most powerful pirates in the world.

Every time he has been seen since then, he has had a new rank, safe for the Summit War. Another example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Aokiji</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter">Kuzan</a>, who manipulated first the news after Enies Lobby in favour of the Franky Family, and, after resigning, apparently is investigating the underworld. Finally, there are Coby and Helmeppo, who even have their own cover story arc.
</li><li> The manga often has little mini-arcs contained within each chapter's title page) dedicated to characters the Straw Hats encountered (usually the villains) showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNow">where they are now.</a> Examples include Eneru finally reaching the Moon, taking out a band of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirates</a> and finally ruling over the moon with a group of ancient robots as his subjects, Wapol's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> story after he's flung to another island by Luffy and has to start all over, and Caribou getting caught up in a revolution against Kaido.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Chronicles</em> had an episode do this with a different character in the series, be it Misty, Richie, or Brock.

<ul><li> Pansuto Taro. The only character he has any connection to (or wants any connection with) in the cast is Happōsai. As such whenever he appears his plot is at a right-angle to the rest of the series, and the appearance of any of the regulars seems like it's contractually mandated.
</li><li> Also Ryōga, with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection">terrible sense of direction</a> that's led to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">wandering all over the world</a>, and his humorously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">unrequited crush</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">his rival's</a> fiancée.

And the manga implies she still has some adventures off-screen in which <em>Sailor Moon</em> is her sidekick.
</li><li> Haruka and Michiru are usually living their own adventure while the protagonists are in Tokyo. In the anime they even leave after the third season specifically to do this.
</li></ul></li><li> The Gold Saint Leo Aiolia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> is this in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaEpisodeG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaEpisodeG">Saint Seiya: Episode.G</a></em> and in the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiyaSoulOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiyaSoulOfGold">Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold</a></em> (in the latter this apply to all the Gold Saints).
</li><li> There are many examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>, the biggest one likely being Yamato and Kapuu. Yamato is a boy who found a creature called Kapuu, and alongside his friends, went in many adventures with him, even going to magical worlds and space, and fighting against evil <em>Yokai</em>. Kapuu had a verbal tic, and claimed to be a hero of justice, but was actually quite clumsy and couldn't even swim, in spite of resembling a frog. Yamato also has his own supporting cast of friends. And, yet, he was just a one-shot Keroro character in both the anime and the manga. Fuyuki meets him right after Kapuu had disappeared for unknown reasons, and notes the similarities between their stories. The manga version of the story even ends with a report where Fuyuki writes about how he realized now that the world didn't spin around him, and other stories similar to his own could happen elsewhere, basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> this trope, for readers who hadn't understood the point of the story.
<ul><li> In the anime, Yamato is voiced by Rika Matsumoto, Pokemon's Ash original voice actress, and the episode title used a "De Arinsu" verbal tic, rather than Keroro's "De Arimasu". The narrator even had to make it clear that the viewer still was watching Keroro after a few minutes into the episode, before the recurring Keroro characters appeared in the story.
</li><li> The third movie ends with Dark Keroro traveling to another planet, while followed by his former subordinates, and, while infiltrating the planet to start a new invasion, he's found by a couple of siblings very similar to Fuyuki and Natsumi in a similar way to the events of Keroro's first episode, with the implication that a similar story will happen there.
</li><li> In addition to that, several of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> characters in the show are shown to have their own off screen adventures, like Baio's and Ouka's Street Fighting battles which are acknowledged several times in the anime and manga.

<div class="indent">Another irritation is the way in which we meet apparently major characters [...] who are introduced with fanfares of dialogue and then never developed or given anything to do. The entire movie seems crowded with loose ends, overlooked developments and forgotten characters, and there are little snatches of dialogue where some of these minor characters seem to be soldiering on in their original subplots as if unaware that they've been cut from the movie.

Inverting this trope, The Dude <strong>is</strong> the hero of the story of the bowling league and his team's struggle against "Da Jesus", but we never get to see how that turned out.

In the film proper, Kong is only briefly mentioned and what he was doing during the events of the story are left unknown.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NecessaryRoughness">Necessary Roughness</a></em> comes Charlie Bankshe, the only player on the original Armadillos football team not to be banned from playing football for life. The story of how he not only persisted in the sport despite his obvious athletic shortcomings, but triumphed by making the winning touchdown at the end of the film's climactic football game, would have made a fine movie in and of itself.

</li><li> Several minor characters wrote similar memoirs to Cain (that is similar to his "official" memoirs, not the candid ones that the stories consist of). Most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">Sulla</a> (who's only a Lieutenant/Captain at the time of the books, but is Lady General by the time she wrote them).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Morgan</a>. Come on, we get to hear the stories about how he <em>nuked</em> a shapeshifting demi-god of pure evil, and cut his way through the entire Red Court, fully intent on dueling a being that has <em>Odin</em> matched for metaphysical muscle.

Watch out, though, for the other commanders ever getting character development. If they do, bastardry will ensue at some point during the book.
</li><li> In 2013 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodsOfGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodsOfGuilt">The Gods of Guilt</a></em>, protagonist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelHaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelHaller">Michael Haller</a> has a brief encounter with his brother Harry Bosch in court; Harry says he's working on "a cold case from 'ninety-four." This is a reference to Harry Bosch short story "Switchblade", which was published the following year.
</li><li> Admiral Hamish Alexander, Earl of White Haven, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series. He is already an admiral when the series begins, and thus spends most of his time commanding large fleet actions that are analyzed in exhaustive detail by the main characters after the event. Probably the first notable instance of this is the Third Battle of Yeltsin, a spectacular Manticoran victory that was critical to the opening phases of the war — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">which we never see</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a> (outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>, where he <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>), Wedge Antilles tends to be this. He's rarely in focus, but almost always there. In the X-Wing Series, Luke, Leia, and Han Solo are the Heroes of Another Story.
</li><li> There are so many characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> that would make good protagonists:
<ul><li> Nymphadora Tonks. She's probably just slumming in this series; surely she is off having awesome Auror adventures at other times.
</li><li> Snape is of particular notability, in that he is so deeply involved with the story that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that the books are just as much his story as Harry's. Appropriately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Harry's younger son is named after him</a>.</span>
</li><li> Nicolas Flamel probably would have a pretty interesting story to tell, considering that he lived for more than 650 years.
</li><li> Neville is an interesting case, because it <em>could</em> have been his story had Voldemort made different choices. As it stands, there's an entire alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> in <em>Deathly Hallows</em> (Neville, Luna and Ginny) with enough stories to take up an entire novel.
</li><li> The previous generation characters (Lily, Snape and the Marauders) had <em>more</em> than enough high drama to support their own series. Plus, the epilogue gives us the tantalizing hint of a whole new generation headed for Hogwarts. It's not surprising that novel-length Marauder-era and next-generation fanfics are so common.
</li><li> The Order of the Phoenix, a resistance group that fights Voldemort. Both the past Order (which disbanded before the beginning of the series) and the present incarnation are alluded to having many off-screen adventures that we never hear about. The past Order in particular could easily have its own book series.
</li><li> Albus Dumbledore was apparently the Harry Potter of his day — his most famous feat was his defeat of the previous Dark Lord before Voldemort, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Predecessor Villain</a> Gellert Grindelwald, in what is regarded as the greatest wizard's duel in history. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grindelwald also happened to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend">Evil Former Friend</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">First Love</a>, and (since Dumbledore swore off love after him) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">the love of his life</a></span>. <em>Deathly Hallows</em> briefly touches on his past, and the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> films will cover his conflicts with Grindelwald.
</li><li> Newt Scamander only gets name dropped once or twice as the author of <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, one of Harry's First Year text books. He's described briefly in the prologue when said book was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">published in real life</a>, but otherwise he's barely elaborated as a character. Years later, Newt is given his own story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts">in a series of films named after his book</a>, having all sorts of adventures involving several of the creatures featured in the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> book, some 70 years before the events of the main series. Oh, and it turns out he had several run-ins with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Grindelwald</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> are told entirely from Katniss's point of view, there's a lot of details and stories we miss out on because she is unaware of what's happening.
<ul><li> Thresh and Foxface throughout the first novel are off having adventures completely separate from Katniss. Foxface and Katniss unknowingly cross each others paths a couple of times but Katniss only runs into Thresh once during the games. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thresh is also apparently off having a major battle with Cato for several days while Katniss and Peeta are in the cave</span>.
</li><li> In the first half of the first book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Peeta could be considered this as he has some agenda and his own adventures with the Career Tributes. We find out about some of these actions later after he has revealed his true colors</span>.
</li><li> The Avox Girl, who apparently had an entire adventure before she ever crossed paths with Katniss.
</li><li> Bonnie and Twill. Katniss hears the first half of their story <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but is left wondering what happened to them</span>.
</li><li> We also never find out what the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rebel movement was up to before Katniss came on the scene (it's way too big and organized to just be a reaction to one defiant act), or how Finnick, Johanna, Beatee, etc all joined it and their stories.</span>
</li><li> Nor do we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gale evacuate what remains of District 12 after they are bombed.</span> He is considered by many a literal hero.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos">Hyperion Cantos</a></em>, Rachel Weintraub, who we see travel to the far future at the end of Fall of Hyperion, and then learn that she later returns to a (slightly less distant) the future. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Just read the books.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>, where the protagonists from our world might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOne">The Only One</a> for the brief time they are there, but Narnia exists for thousands of years without them and is said to have many adventures and heroes of its own that we never hear of (as well as many times where nothing exciting at all is happening). The (adult) Pevensie children become this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em> and Shasta is this to them (his being the story we get to see).
</li><li> In two of the early stories from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em> series ("There is a Tide" and "Flatlander"), a Terran cop named Sigmund Ausfaller shows up as a minor recurring character, but its implied that this guy is an even more competent adventurer than Schaeffer is. We'd have to wait for nearly forty years before Niven would co-author a trio of novels featuring Ausfaller as the hero... and it turns out he's absolutely more competent than Schaeffer was.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Second Stage Lensmen</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien">Nadreck of Palain VII</a>. He goes on a solo mission to destroy an enemy base that no one has been able to touch. He does so by inciting the locals into a civil war. However, despite great urging, he absolutely refuses to tell anyone how he did it, because in his eyes the mission was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">unmitigated disaster</a>. His shame comes from the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">he comes from a race of cowards</a>, and he was forced at one point to kill three people directly to complete his mission, rather than causing them to kill each other. To make the point clearer, these people included the highest-ranking enemies at the base, and in a society where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a> is taken to the extreme that means he had to personally fight the <em>hardest</em> targets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em> lives off this literally. It is maintained by dreams and stories and everyone has one. To quote the narrator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">time and again throughout the novel</a>, <em>But that is another story and shall be told another time.</em> Specific examples include:
<ul><li> Pyornrachzark, Blubb, Vooshvazool, and Gluckuk, the heralds that travel to warn of the Nothing early on in the novel. We lose track of them, but presumably they all go on to, at least, make the journey back home.
</li><li> Hynreck, the disgraced hero who left on his own while his comrades followed Bastian, went after a monster who kidnapped his love interest, and won, but we're spared the details and what happens next.
</li><li> Yikka, a mule who served as Bastian's mount for a while, is not exactly an example, but after being granted fertility and a faithful encounter with a pegasus stallion by Bastian, she has a son called Patalplan, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxymoronicBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxymoronicBeing">half-mule, half pegasus hybrid</a> that is himself an example, as he reportedly had many peculiar adventures.
</li><li> And then we have The City of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Old Emperors</a>, where every single inhabitant is this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">was</a>. The City is the final destination of every single human visitor to Fantastica who failed/refused to go back to the real world. They all inevitably attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">replace the Childlike Empress</a>, bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory">chaos and war to Fantastica</a> before eventually wasting away all of their memories of the real world by abusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmuletOfConcentratedAwesome">Auryn</a>. Once they lost all memories, they became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">blank husks of the people they were</a> and ended up in the City.</span>
</li><li> If Hykrion the Strong is to be believed, one of the many visitors to Fantastica from the real world was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> himself</em>.
</li><li> The biggest one is Atreyu, because after Balthasar is told that he can't leave Fantastica until all the stories he set in motion are finished, Atreyu volunteers to finish all those stories in his place so Balthasar can go home.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final stage of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em>, the last survivors of the besieged Burgundians are at last taken out by the retinue of the Gothic king Dietrich of Bern (not Bern in Switzerland, but Verona in Italy). Dietrich, the mythical version of king Theoderic the Great, and his followers Hildebrand <em>et al</em>. literally are the heroes of a whole different cycle of legends and stories, so the decision to bring him in not only was an early example of a "cross-over", but also served to enhance the standing of Gunther and Hagen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool">The Secrets of Drearcliff Grange School</a></em>, there are occasional reminders during the earlier parts of the book that the school has plenty of students and exciting events apart from Amy and her friends and their adventures. (Less so after the main plot kicks in and the school gets taken over as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a>, because then everything happening at the school becomes part of a single story.) There's also the case of Enid ffolliott, who dramatically appears in time to save Amy from a peril after being missing for two years; it's strongly suggested that what she was doing during those two years was adventurous and possibly world-saving, although we don't get many details.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirAproposOfNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirAproposOfNothing">Sir Apropos of Nothing</a></em> seems to be beset with many, many heroes of other stories. Whenever they try to regale him with their adventures, however, he <em>always</em> cuts them off...because he abhors such stories.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> did this several times in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Middle-earth stories</a>. He was creating a mythology, and he knew that mythologies are never perfect records, and there are always gaps which leave tantalizing hints of other stories. Some examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, while he's certainly involved in the main plot, Gandalf spends much of the novel attending to other matters, which turn out to be destroying the Mirkwood stronghold of the Necromancer, otherwise known as Sauron.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, there are hints of adventures that the other members of the Fellowship had before meeting the hobbits at Rivendell, such as Aragorn's capture of Gollum, or Gandalf's escape from the Ringwraiths. At one point, Sam wonders if Gollum thinks he's the hero of his own story.
</li><li> Both stories focus on the exploits of Gandalf, who is only one of five wizards who were sent into the world by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a>, each with missions of great importance to all of Middle-earth. Little is known of what Saruman did before he became evil, and Radagast is only mentioned fleetingly. The other two wizards, Alatar and Pallando, are not even named in the main story but it is mentioned elsewhere that their actions in the East were crucial in weakening Sauron's forces.
</li><li> There's also the battles at Lothlórien and Dale, which are briefly mentioned and correspond closely with the battles at Minas Tirith. The latter one beneath the Lonely Mountain is stated to be the largest one of them all because of its close proximity to Sauron's Easterling forces.
</li><li> Overall, the entire northern arm of the War of the Ring is only briefly described in the books, despite its importance in diverting a very large portion of Sauron's strength from Lórien, Rivendell, and Gondor. The Men of Dale and the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain gave their southern allies the time that they needed to fight off Sauron's primary forces and destroy the One Ring.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> is full to the brim with these. Special mention should go to King Stannis (who survived a siege, later described as "They were down to rats and beets, horses and dogs have been eaten long ago"), Dolorous Edd (just about anything he says, but highlights include finding a dead brother of the Night Watch floating in the barrel of wine and being attacked by a bear!), Maester Aemon (the man was 102 years old when he died and has lived through most of the history known to main characters), Aegon the Fifth (A hero from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg">Tales of Dunk and Egg</a></em>, long dead in main novels), Barristan The Bold, Tormund Giantsbane, Theon's friend Cleftjaw, Mance Rayder and Lord Bloodraven... This list goes on and on.
</li><li> Roran Stronghammer of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> is an example. He's technically a point of view character, but over the course of <em>Brisingr</em> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">slaughters nearly one hundred men from atop an ever-growing mountain of their shattered corpses</a>, is summarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">beaten to within an inch of his life</a> for disobeying orders, immediately goes out and wrestles an Urgal chieftan into submission, and leads his new troops to several important victories over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. And everyone completely forgets about him once Eragon gets back from his vacation, to the point that he <em>isn't even mentioned</em> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>.
<ul><li> Saphira gives a blessing of sorts to an infant girl, later informing Eragon that the girl won't have an ordinary life after receiving it, and that what he just witnessed was the beginning of a whole new legend. And then it turns out that they screwed up and cursed her to suffer other people's problems. After they find out, they try to remove the curse, but only partially remove it, resulting in someone who is aware of other people's problems, but is not inclined to help. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">It's implied that she is now on a path to become a villain</a>.
</li><li> An even more blatant example comes in <em>Brisingr</em>, when Angela asks Eragon to bless a mother and daughter whose fortunes she had just read. She even lampshades this later by refusing to tell Eragon anything about the two, and they only have one more brief appearance in the final battle in <em>Inheritance</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">lampshaded</a> in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">Stephen Maturin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Jagiello</a>, right after Jagiello loses his grip on a ship's mast, narrowly avoids the deck, plunges into the sea, and is pulled out roaring with laughter: in a bit of metafictional humor, Jagiello jokingly says that the hero of the story never dies in such a unspectacular fashion, and that he considers himself to be the hero of his own story.
</li><li> This is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FifthBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FifthBusiness">Fifth Business</a></em>. Dunstan Ramsay isn't even the hero of his <em>own</em> story; instead, he (according to Liesl) is destined to be the vital supporting character to everyone else. Strictly speaking, the hero of the story is the successful, handsome Boy Staunton, but the narration only checks in on him now and again.
</li><li> The eight and ninth Erast Fandorin novels, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SheLoverOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SheLoverOfDeath">She Lover of Death</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeLoverOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeLoverOfDeath">He Lover of Death</a></em>, are two completely separate mysteries being investigated by Fandorin in Moscow at the same time. Each book contains a few passing references to Fandorin's other case.

When Kirk mentions he was present at a particular event, the captain he's talking too responds with a casual "oh yeah, that was you", and it's mentioned that this captain was off having his own adventure at the time.

<ul><li> This trope used to be named after Colonel Makepeace, the leader of SG-3. Makepeace was even briefly put in charge of SG-1 after O'Neill's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> as the highest-ranking officer in SG teams — right before he was exposed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. The new leader of SG-3, Colonel Reynolds, picked up the trope after that, and held it longer than Makepeace ever did. Colonel Makepeace gets a moment when he leads an assault team composed of half a dozen SG teams to rescue SG-1 from Hathor. Of course he fails, the rescuers being rescued in turn by Bra'tac, Teal'c, and General Hammond (in one of his rare off-world trips).
</li><li> You could say this is true for all of the other SG teams who are off on their own assignments, which sometimes include assisting SG-1. In the two-part episode "Heroes", SG-13 is shown off on a mission of their own.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Bra'tac</a>, as a leader in the Jaffa Rebellion, he can also qualify as this, as can other rebel leaders such as Ishtar.

<ul><li> The spinoff also features such a character, Major Lorne. Sheppard, Rodney, Teyla, and Ford (later Ronon) are the "main" Atlantis team that we follow most of the time. Meanwhile, Lorne and his crew are busy with their own missions on other planets that we rarely get to see, only showing up occasionally when he is needed as support for the main characters.
</li><li> The cast of SG-1 is actually sometimes this for SGA. It's understood that they're still doing big important things that we just don't see. (Especially while their show was actually still going on. There'd often be references to the SG-1 plot — nothing too detailed, but... y'know, just in case you forgot that the Ori and Baal are <em>bad.</em>)

<ul><li> Also showed up in this show more than once; in the first episode, we see a number of starships (one of which is being captained by Samantha Carter of SG-1), who then slide out of focus as the main plot kicks into gear. They're alluded to a few times afterwards, and a few episodes in the second season involve characters from the previous two series working to get SGU's cast home.
</li><li> The alternate crew created by a time travel incident, thought to have been killed, actually landed on a planet a thousand years in the past. They were just as much "them" as the crew that remained on the ship (of whom they were unaware), and although they didn't know they'd traveled back in time, Eli theorized it was possible that they had. The "real" crew go to see their alternate lives play out in "episodes" captured by the Kinos. Had the show gone onto a third season, it's likely that their descendants would have weaved in and out of the main story.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> most characters are quite literally heroes from another story as we often encounter various fairytale and mythical figures from widely known tales, even DISNEY films. The show usually has entire flashback episodes showing the story of these characters even if they are not main characters within the show itself or will even appear in more than one episode.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em>, we have Jed Garrity, another NTAC agent who seems to be the only other person in that department.

<ul><li> Another example from Enterprise is Shran. They run into him several times, and he tends to take the focus when he does appear, because he's always got his own problems. He even gets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">swoop in and save the Enterprise</a> in one episode.
<ul><li> The writers were even planning on making Shran a main character if the show got a fifth season. This is probably why they destroyed his ship in the fourth season. That pretty much ended his story and forced him to join the main story.
</li><li> The <em>Enterprise</em> that became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips">generation ship</a> had plenty of adventures after the crew went back in time. No wonder the Xindi accused the main timeline's <em>Enterprise</em> of having sister ships (before any were completed).
</li><li> There's also Daniels, who fights in the Temporal Cold War to protect the Federation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">TOS</a> tended to suggest that the other <em>Constitution</em>-class starships generally did have their own 'only ship in the sector' and 'stumbled upon a dangerous mystery while exploring' incidents off-screen whenever other <em>Constitution</em>-class starships showed up. No specific individual served the Hero of Another Story role well, though.
<ul><li> Spock became the hero of another story on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">TNG</a> when he dedicated his life to leading an underground dissident movement on Romulus to reunite the Vulcan and Romulan people.

It just focuses on a different cast of characters.
</li><li> Admiral Ross is this within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a> itself, in that he is a competent (somewhat) admiral who actually does something useful, so Sisko doesn't have to do all alone. Also we have Martok, who flies attack runs against the Dominion.
</li><li> Also Dukat, during his time as a guerilla on a stolen Klingon bird-of-prey. Until his yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, that is.
</li><li> In the episode <em>Apocolypse Rising</em> the character's attempting to prove that Gowron is a changeling mole, infiltrate a Klingon awards ceremony. Naturally this is a gathering place of heroes from another story.
</li><li> Quark and Rom's mother, Ishka. She is seen challenging the degrading treatment of females on Ferenginar, is a genius businesswoman, secretly becomes the consort of the Grand Nagus and effectively takes over running the entire Ferengi Alliance, but is only seen when she becomes a problem for Quark.
</li><li> Deep Space Nine also introduced Sloan and the agents of Section 31 (though many fans disagree whether they can be considered "heroes").
</li><li> Subverted with a former classmate of Bashir. He assumes she has interesting stories to tell about her deep space assignment, and she says it ended up being a charting expedition. It seems a starship having exciting adventures on a regular basis, like the Enterprise, is the exception. Space is huge and mostly empty.

<ul><li> Detective Profaci on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, who was eventually a casualty in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">Tonight, Someone Dies</a> episode (not killed, but arrested for corruption, and exited stage left just the same).

</li></ul></li><li> The SRU of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> had a total of five teams, but the show only focuses on Team One. Teams Three and Four make a few brief appearances each, while Two and Five are only mentioned, but it's implied their days are much the same as the series cast.
<ul><li> Notable individuals include Rolie, who is Team One in the first episode but is promoted to Sergeant and never seen again, and Donna Sabine, who fills in for Jules after she's shot and transfers to Team Three when Jules returns. Wordy becomes this as well after he resigns from SRU. (The latter two do make occasional appearances after their departures.)
</li></ul></li><li> Though he's usually a part of the main story, Larry Fleindhart of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> takes a trip into space in Season 3 and spends several months living in the desert in Season 6. He never gives more than very fleeting details about those experiences, but they would no doubt be interesting stories in their own right.
<ul><li> Megan Reeves also goes on special assignment for the latter half of season three (a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>, as actress Diane Farr was pregnant).

</li></ul></li><li> Curtis on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, plus several other less notable CTU agents, who lead tactical teams whenever Jack Bauer can't be there for plot reasons.
</li><li> Commander Turner was the most visible of several JAG officers who served this purpose on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em>, whatever assignment the series regulars weren't handling tended to be handed off to Private Sponge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> did this in its first season, alluding to other hunters associated with the Winchesters, most notably Pastor Jim and Caleb, each mentioned in multiple episodes before a demon who was hunting down the boy's contacts killed them. This same storyline introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">Bobby</a>, who they were able to warn in time, and who has become the longest-living recurring character of the show.
<ul><li> Early season six has an episode focusing on Bobby, with the brothers only appearing briefly.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, since the Apocalypse arc came to an end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Castiel</a> is becoming this. A focus on HIS story would be frankly too effects-heavy for the show.
</li><li> Spoofed with Garth, a hunter who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick">teams up</a> with Team Free Will in season 7; as well as having a name drop in season 6.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Bobby: "Yeah, Garth, what do you got? ... Never heard of a vamp doin' that. It doesn't sound like our kind of thing. Better drop a dime to the FBI."

</div><ul><li> Season 8 reveals that during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between seasons 7 and 8, Garth has been rebuilding the hunter network and has assumed the mentor/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> role that Bobby used to have.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> A number of examples on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, notably Captain Maynard and the EAS <em>Cortez</em> notably featured, a huge exploration ship which served the more traditional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> role of exploration. It's indicated that they spend so much time out exploring, that most EarthForce personnel will be fortunate to see one in person <em>once</em>. To hammer the point home, much of Maynard's time spent visiting Babylon 5 had him and Sheridan trading stories about what they'd done over the years since they last met.
</li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> includes a great number of minor characters and guest stars who serve as love interests for the main characters, but only a handful last more than an episode or two. Of all the secondary characters, only Mike (Paul Rudd) convincingly suggests a character whose life does not revolve around the main characters. Although one of the stars, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) also repeatedly implies that she has a very strange life going on off-screen.
<ul><li> Pete Becker, the billionaire thirtysomething software tycoon and Monica's short-term love interest also had a lot going on off-screen, given the small snippets of his real life that we see.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith">The One with...</a> The Ultimate Fighting Champion</em> had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrystal">Billy Crystal</a></em> as "Thomas" and "Tim" who take up space in the usual sofa the titular Friends sit on in Central Perk. They proceed to have a very eccentric discussion about their lives which leads to Joey interrupting causing Tim to realize Thomas had been sleeping with his wife. They then promptly leave and are never mentioned again.
</li><li> In an early episode, Monica and Rachel date a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a> doctors (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney">George Clooney</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahWyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahWyle">Noah Wyle</a>) who are implied to have their own regular sitcom style dating misadventures.
</li></ul></li><li> The chipper and eccentric Special Agent Lundy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em> has had a long and very successful career catching serial killers. That would make a great tv show.
</li><li> After the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> season 6 episode "Justice", Oliver Queen's Justice League was frequently made mention of (usually by Chloe) as they travelled the world dismantling Lex Luthor's secret metahuman labs. Every so often a Leaguer (or combinations thereof) would return for a guest appearance, and during the season 9 finale multiple heroes (including those from the Justice Society) provided cameos via the Watchtower's monitors to establish Zod's threat as a global one.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> touched upon this. Xander gets left behind as the characters take on a world-shaking threat. He himself has to deal with a clearly homicidal school bully. It gets much, much worse. Xander's story only briefly intersects with the 'Let's stop the world from ending' the other cast members are involved with...but if he had failed, the bully would have interfered with the aforementioned world-saving, triggering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">fun times</a>.
<ul><li> Over the course of the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Riley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Oz</a>, and the entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> becomes this.
</li><li> More specifically, in the penultimate episode of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Angel</span> arrives in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment. Unusually, this is a character who used to be one of the heroes of this story, left to be the hero of another story, comes back as both of the above, and then gets sent away explicitly to be the hero of another story if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> fails.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, Stella (Sarah Chalke) guest stars as Ted's love interest for several episodes. Her character has a child from a prior marriage, which initially makes her reluctant to date Ted. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she leaves Ted to reunite with her former husband.</span> Ted's final voice-over narration observes:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ted</strong>: <em>It was the perfect ending to the perfect love story, it just wasn't mine.</em>
</div><ul><li> Later on we get to see (parts of) that story from the other guy's perspective after a movie was made about it, with Ted's character as a flanderized villain. Ted is not happy about this.
</li><li> The 200th episode "How Your Mother Met Me" is centered on the Mother and what kind of life she was living before she met Ted, from 2005 up until the wedding. It also shows just how close she could have crossed paths with Ted but always just missed him, including when Ted was teaching in the wrong classroom, when she mistakenly believed she was in the wrong classroom and was about to head back to the right classroom when Ted rushed past her and again, when the Mother went out for drinks with Louis and walked by Ted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">who was wearing a dress</a> without seeing him.
</li><li> Robin, despite being a protagonist (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ted's future wife</span>) gets this in <em>The Front Porch</em> episode, where she asks the group to stay up and watch her deliver the news. They do so, but Ted and Lily get into a fight just as the show starts, and Robin's actions during it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">which include delivering a baby and saving two lives</a>) are not noticed by them at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy">Meta Guy</a> Abed sees his life as a collection of tropes. In one episode he remarks that "we did lean on that pretty hard last week. I could lie low for an episode." He doesn't have many lines in the rest of the episode but he can be seen in the background of another scene delivering a baby, which gets a call back in the next season when Troy asks if he just always has his own little adventures, which include ticking off a list of the "quintessential list of college experiences," a list of college film tropes. In another episode we learn he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">became the mask</a> during a trip to the set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown">Cougar Town</a> and had several imaginary adventures. Presumably, other characters like Annie's Boobs have active off-camera lives.
</li><li> There's another study group on campus that apparently features Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Starburns.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Troy Barnes</span> becomes this in Season 5 after he leaves Greendale to sail around the world with Levar Burton.
</li><li> Later, in Season 6, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirley Bennett</span> also leaves and moves to LA to solve crimes along with an unnamed detective who's lost both his wife and the use of his legs.
</li><li> Todd is apparently a war hero.
</li><li> Lampshaded, frequently: overheard remarks from classmates include such gems as We almost had a class that wasn't about them and "Do you remember the time they went fishing?"

<ul><li> The standalone features <em>Razor</em> and <em>The Plan</em> tell the other stories: in <em>Razor</em> the protagonist is an officer on the Pegasus, while <em>The Plan</em> retells events from the Cylons' viewpoint.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>'s first season the protagonists meet a group of what at first they think are gangbangers who turn out to be protecting a bunch of senior citizens too fragile to be moved. We never find out what happens to them (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a discarded plotline from the season two premiere reveals they were murdered, implied to be by The Governor</span>). Likewise Morgan and his son until two seasons later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FromTheEarthToTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FromTheEarthToTheMoon">From the Earth to the Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series was produced by director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonHoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonHoward">Ron Howard</a> and lead actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks">Tom Hanks</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13">Apollo 13</a></em>, retelling the story of NASA and the different missions going to the moon. The episode focusing on Apollo 13 was this, as instead of showing the astronauts (as the film had already done that) it instead focused on the media's coverage on the incident.
</li><li> Also, the episode "The Original First Wives Club", about the wives of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo astronauts and what they had to put up with, handle on their own, and do as wives of astronauts, shone a spotlight on women who were, in their own way, just as heroic as their husbands.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx">Lexx</a></em> movie Thodin the Arch-Heretic was almost the hero of the story, but then he and his compatriots all got killed and we ended up with three losers and an undead assassin.

</li><li> A third season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> reveals an alternate timeline where Rhade, Dylan's second in command in the first episode, kills Dylan in their fight in that episode.

<ul><li> The fifth season gives us DEA Agent Alex Miller, essentially an older, more world weary version of protagonist, Raylan Givens. It's very easy to imagine that Miller's past is as exciting as Raylan's present, with recurring villain Hot-Rod Dunham as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Boyd Crowder</a>.
</li><li> The series also has Raylan's fellow US Marshals, Rachel Brooks and Tim Gutterson. If some of the hints they let drop are indicative, Tim, and Rachel are dealing with cases that are every bit as interesting as the ones that end up on Raylan's desk.
</li></ul></li><li> It wasn't apparent at the time, but Saul Goodman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> turns out to have been this, now that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">his own prequel</a>.
</li><li> The Arrowverse has several series, all of whom are "Another Story" with respect to each other.
<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, John Constantine fills this role, implying that his adventures haven't ended just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine">his series</a> was cancelled. When someone asks why Constantine can't help with their latest mystical problem, Oliver explains that currently Constantine is in Hell. Literally. No more details are given on the subject. Another episode mentions Christopher Chance a.k.a. the Human Target is in another country, again no details are given.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em> has Jessie Quick and Jay Garrick, both of whom have their own adventures as speedsters on Earth 2 and 3 respectively. Gypsy also has off-camera adventures as an inter-dimensional bounty hunter.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> Rip Hunter created an entire agency that by all accounts is better at what they do than the main characters. The series also introduced the Justice Society of America and Jonah Hex. Brief glimpses of Mari a.k.a. Vixen are occasionally shown (she also has an online animated series).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a></em>, Supergirl is the defender of National City. Superman is busy defending Metropolis, so he's usually only mentioned, but occasionally shows up to lend Supergirl a hand. A few lines hint Batman is also an active hero. Miss Martian left Earth to lead the resistance against the White Martians.
</li><li> An online spin-off shows the heroes of Earth X, who are fighting against the Nazis.

<ul><li> <em>Agents of SHIELD</em> has now generated a few Heroes of Another Story of its own. Any SHIELD agent who survived the events of the first two seasons but didn't join either HYDRA, Team Coulson, or a neutral third party like Stark Industries or the CIA counts (named examples include Mike Peterson, Agent Weaver and the other surviving members of "The Real SHIELD", who are presumably still off doing SHIELD-y stuff somewhere). The biggest examples, though, are Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, new leads introduced in Season 2 who eventually depart for their own spinoff, <em>Marvel's Most Wanted</em> - though it's been cancelled and re-ordered so many times now it's hard to say whether we'll ever see these adventures on-screen or not.
</li></ul></li><li> Inspector Zenigata of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> series stars in his own live-action dramas where he gets ensnared into several dangerous cases that were made to look like Lupin was the culprit. Zenigata, being the premier Lupin expert, sets out to prove his nemesis was being framed and it shows that when he's not on Lupin's trail, Zenigata really is the most accomplished detective on the force.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em>, "Retribution", "Colonel" Francois Lefanu, a slave leader in the Haitian revolution, parlays with the British, revealing his men killed a group of deserters from the <em>Renown</em>, mistaking them for Spanish, and demanding the British leave the area, asserting it is not their fight.
</li><li> The majority of protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> usually continue having the adventures offscreen after their story ends.

Sento Kiryu/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild">Kamen Rider Build</a> also qualifies, as his story is the first one that takes place outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> concept established by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Decade</a></em> (at least until he engages in multiversal shenanigans in the finale).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JaneTheVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JaneTheVirgin">Jane the Virgin</a></em>, this is done with Jane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">First Love</a> Adam, who has his own Narrator (who is a woman, as opposed to Jane's male narrator) and all.

Rice of the 10th Armored Division, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> in a cameo. Knowing that Bastogne was going to be surrounded, and knowing that the 101st was going to be really short on ammunition, Rice made nine separate trips in a jeep that was towing a trailer back and forth from a nearby supply depot to Bastogne in order to bring what ammo he could to the troops digging in against the German advance. He did this on his own volition. His last trip was technically made after the Germans had surrounded the town, and the only reason he didn't make a tenth trip was because he was specifically ordered by his CO to stand down. Rice was nominated for a Medal of Honor for his actions.

</li><li> Both Felix and Isaac's groups assume this role at different points in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> games. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001">Golden Sun (2001)</a></em>, Felix is on a quest with the antagonists to unleash Alchemy on the world and you hear a few people mention him and his group as you travel. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, you take over Felix's role while occasionally hearing tales about Isaac's group as you travel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Isaac and Felix's parties finally meet at one point and they team up to finish Felix's quest.</span>
<ul><li> There's also Sean and Ouranos, who you ride with on the boat across the Karagol Sea. They have unique sprites and icons, personality quirks (such as Ouranos' fear of water), and have obviously been traveling around for a while to be as strong as they are. Although they get their asses handed to them by the Kraken (Which happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>), they are more than capable of fighting off the other monsters that attack the ship.

<ul><li> An interesting twist occurs in some of the cutscenes, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> YOU are the aforementioned hero, thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Whether you can call them heroes is debatable, but the various protagonists in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> franchise often serve as this to each other, as each focuses game on the exploits and story of a different character, but they'll often (briefly) cross paths with each other.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>. The protaganist, C.J. sees his insane girlfriend run off with a quiet racing competitor. Said quiet man is the main character, Claude, in the (chronologically later, though earlier released) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCityStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCityStories">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</a></em> focuses on Victor Vance, a character that died in the <strong>prologue</strong> of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a></em>.
</li><li> The main story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> centers around Niko Bellic. The two following DLC releases, collectively titled "Episodes from Liberty City", focus on biker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheLostAndDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheLostAndDamned">Johnny Klebitz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony">Luis Fernando Lopez</a>, bodyguard and hitman for club owner Tony Prince. The three occasionally run across one another, but their stories are largely independent. All three are together in a single location only once, during a diamond deal they've all been brought into by various circumstances (which was foreshadowed by the achievement for completing the diamond mission in Niko's story, called "Impossible Trinity").
</li><li> Can happen in normal gameplay in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>. The three protagonists (Michael, Trevor, and Franklin) usually only work together when hanging out as friends or during missions, but there are chances—however slim—that a protagonist might actually cross paths with one or both of the other protagonists doing something else, independent of the player's control. However, there's a lot of land, sea, and air to travel on, so the chances of the protagonists meeting each other by accident are usually <em>very</em> slim. Also, all three protagonists can run into Patrick <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McReary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McReary">Mc Reary</a> (A friend/accomplice of Niko Bellic back in Liberty City) during a failed robbery, extract him out of there, and wind up having him work with them on a heist!
</li></ul></li><li> Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple would have made a good protagonist for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> DLC. The only real difference between him and Silent Protagonist Isaac Clarke is that Isaac's girlfriend was in Medical - Jacob's was in hydroponics. Through the game, you find logs on the same path as Isaac's, with Temple literally doing all the things that Isaac does, only failing. But, hey, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> at least he found his girlfriend alive. Their murder comes off as a genuinely tragic moment, despite the fact that you never interacted with either of them</span>.
<ul><li> Lexine Weller from the DLC <em>Severed</em> does not encounter Isaac Clarke at any point in either of the first two games, despite having her incredibly important storyline due to her immunity to the effects of the Marker and managing to survive both of the Necromorph outbreaks Isaac was present for.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, Samus Aran and Link can be found resting in bed at various points.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> is home to a huge cast of characters. Some you interact with alive, others you find dead on arrival, and others you run into just as their own personal story ends. It's not uncommon to come across the corpse of a person and wonder if they were just unlucky and got killed, or were in the process of their own journey.
<ul><li> The mysterious stranger leaves his footprints all over the irradiated future of America, but you never learn a concrete detail about him, although there are details scattered about such as a man who may be his son in New Vegas, or Nick Valentine from 4 commenting on seeing him "again", implying he's been trying to figure out who he is for some time. Additionally, you never know if he's helping you out or if the two of you coming in contact like this is a repetitive coincidence.
</li><li> Marcus really gives this impression, being among those responsible for taking down the Enclave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> and reappearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> as leader of a Super Mutant refuge.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, you can find an emergency broadcast in an area stating that a child is sick, and the family is holed up waiting for supplies, having escaped some kind of disaster. When you find this little bunker, you realize it's a radio with an emergency message that's been playing on loop for an unknown amount of time. Judging by the skeletons in the room they may have been there since the war, two hundred years ago. You never really learn who the family was or how they got there either, and you never learn if they got the help they needed (although it's likely they didn't given they stayed in the bunker).
</li><li> Before you board the boat to Point Lookout in the <em>Fallout 3</em> DLC of that name, you meet a woman named Catherine, who asks you to find here missing daughter Nadine there. Nadine turns out to be doing fine, having her own adventures and helping the Lone Wanderer with theirs a few times. Before you confront the ferryman late in the main story, you find Nadine has beaten you to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has Vulpes Inculta, a spy who manages to beat the Courier to Nipton, The Strip, and The Fort, no matter how fast the Courier travels. He is involved in many covert operations, and it's implied that when you don't see him, he's wreaking havoc in NCR territory somewhere.
<ul><li> Any of the NCR Rangers. They have spies everywhere, even at all the Legion bases. You even meet a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> drug dealer</span> who turns out to be one. Imagine how many are out there.
</li><li> And finally there's Ulysses, who is gradually revealed to have visited every location explored in the DLC packs and had his own adventures there before his final confrontation with the Courier in <em>Lonesome Road</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> has you run into a group of five people: Preston Garvey, Sturges, Mama Murphy, Jun Long, and Marcy Long. The four appear to have been running for a long time, and had a much larger group than the ragtag group of five left at the end. After helping them escape Concord, Preston can tell you about the minutemen, a huge plot regarding betrayal, the collapse of the minutemen, and so forth. Should you check the southern end of Quincy, you can also come across three gunners known as Tessa, Clint, and Baker. Killing them and reading the various terminals explains even more of the tragic events that led up to the five holing up in the museum you saved them from.
<ul><li> Kellogg's entire backstory shows him as having one heck of a bad train ride called life that ended with you and him confronting one another. The segment of the game where you find out all of this roughly takes up over ten minutes of time just to watch.
</li><li> Paladin Brandis and his team had a huge streak of bad luck that resulted in him being stranded in the Commonwealth for a long time. You only arrive in the Commonwealth after he's become paranoid and nearly given up, and never learn the entirety of his story.
</li><li> You meet Brian Vergil <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after his escape from the Institute</span>, and he never really tells you how that went or any of the details between then and when you meet with him, although there are some clues in his old lab.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> has this in the form of other pilots. Especially in <em>Prophecy</em> Maniac and some other pilots start as aces while the player is a green-horn. In missions they often lead different squads and are only heard over radio fulfilling their part of the plan. The player joins them towards the end of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starlancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starlancer">Starlancer</a></em>, the player actually plays this role. Especially in the beginning, the player's team of misfits is largely unknown while established aces like Klaus Steiner are often mentioned on TV. It is not until much later in the game that the player is treated as an equal.
<ul><li> The news reports certainly help to make the player feel like there's a devastating war on, instead of a series of small engagements. A war that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">last another 100 years</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first of the two video game prequels to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> anime series, Holland (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader">Supporting Leader</a> in the main series) initiates his anti-government movement while main character Sumner Sturgeon is busy dealing with his own issues.

You're just there to watch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Cloud</a> discovers that his choppy memories <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are actually those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Zack</a>, who gets his story told in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em></span>.
</li><li> This happens several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first three dungeons of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> let you talk with several groups of other adventurers who are all looking to clear out the dungeons as well, including a party of four lead by a gladiator and his conjurer fiancée who are preparing to clear the first dungeon, another party of three lead by a Roegadyn who arrive at the second dungeon after you've beaten it, and another group of an older adventurer and his granddaughter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All three groups' stories end on sour notes at best - the first group's tank dies in the first dungeon because his fiancée couldn't keep him healed, the older adventurer nearly dies to an elementary blunder and is forced to retire, and the Roegadyn's group are <em>all</em> killed in the third dungeon as they take on too many enemies at once and get overwhelmed.</span>
</li><li> During <em>Stormblood</em>, Estinien wanders around helping people and aiding the Eorzean Alliance when needed. His story does not intersect with the Warrior of Light's except at the end of the 4.0 story <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where he destroys Nidhogg's eyes once they're completely spent of aether fueling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a></span>, during the level 70 Dragoon quest, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and patch 4.56, where he saves the Warrior of Light from Elidibus.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Shadowbringers</em>, Estinien reprises his role to fill in for the Warrior of Light and the Scions while they are in the First, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> while teaming up with Gaius to curb the production of Black Rose, an alchemical superweapon designed to halt the flow of one's aether.

He does this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAShortcut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAShortcut">without any sort of godly powers or assistance from them</a>, and would have gotten further if he didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">encounter Kratos</a> in a dark room. There's also the people who were once all those corpses you see lying around deep inside each of the major locations, and the Argonauts, Perseus, and Icarus are also on their own adventures on the island.
</li><li> Captain Marcus Walker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> is the commander of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Liberty</a> cruiser LNS <em>Utah</em>.

He even offers to help Trent join the Liberty Navy. After helping to defend the Willard Research Station and a Liberty battleship, Walker disappears for a while, before reappearing to help Trent and the others escape from a Liberty ambush in Zone-21. It's not clear what he did while Trent was out doing his thing, but given his impressive record and his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>, it was probably something awesome. Then there's Casper Orillion, the man in charge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">The Order</a>. Actually, there are plenty of characters, including Ozu, Michael King, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">Lord Hakkera</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Diedrich Von Claussen</a>, who are impressive in their own right.
<ul><li> Even cooler, Walker actually mentions that while they were gone, he and his crew launched guerilla attacks against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Rheinland</a> supply depots in the Border Worlds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Pity you don't get to see it.</a>

</li><li> Everyone else at Wigglytuff's Guild in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers</a></em>. They're on their own adventures daily, and you even hear bits and pieces about them. In <em>Explorers Of The Sky</em>, you get to actually step into their shoes and see some of their adventures first hands.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> games often invoke this trope, particularly the ones focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The different characters you play as, while they never meet each other in-game, help to contribute in their own way in order to defeat the Germans on vastly separated fronts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> has Captain Kirrahe, a Salarian Spectial Task Group commando, who gives a rousing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech">Patrick Stewart Speech</a> to his squad telling them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> and act as the distraction while Shepard and his team infiltrate the base and plant a nuke on Virmire. Throughout the mission we hear both the gunfire of their unseen battle <em>and</em> their radio chatter, reminding Shepard that in comparison, Shepard's mission is the <em>easy</em> one.
<ul><li> Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Garrus</a> rejoins the squad early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, the fact that his activities in between 1 and 2 caused all three major mercenary bands in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Omega</a> to join forces to take him down makes it clear that he's been busy, even before this is confirmed during dialogue. His dossier in the <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> the fact that he's practically Shepard's equal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">but is unlikely to fully come into his own as long as he's working with Shepard.</a>

There are many fans out there who are rather vocal about their desire to see a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> title based on <em>that</em> story.

Anne Cunningham plays this trope the most straight: every time Murphy encounters her she looks more rough than before, as she is also enduring the same sort of nightmares and monsters, and she even has a final boss she has to face: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Murphy himself.</span>

You'll often find them in extremely dangerous areas like Anor Londo and Lost Izalith, meaning they must be pretty badass to fight their way there. Moreover, several of them are direct analogues to the player:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Solaire of Astora</a> is undertaking a parallel journey to your own in his world, having conquered all of the challenges you face before you do, engraved his summon sign near a number of bosses, and even, judging by some of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> dialogue, escaped the Undead Asylum just as you did. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you save him in Lost Izalith and summon him for the final boss battle, he then goes on to defeat Gwyn and link the Fire in his own world, thus finding his own sun at long last</span>.
</li><li> Oscar of Astora, the Elite Knight who frees you from your cell and gives you the tools you need to take on your quest, journeyed to the Undead Asylum in hopes of somehow taking part in the supposed prophecy of the Chosen Undead. As it stands in-game, his failure enables the player's victory; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">in an entire subplot cut from the game, however, his role would have gone much farther</a>. In this scenario, Oscar would have escaped the Asylum along with the player, met up with them multiple times after the latter rings the Bells of Awakening (including an instance where he partners up with you to fight through the Forest Hunters and reach Artorias's grave), and had his own dealings with the two Primordial Serpents and perhaps even Solaire. But as it becomes clear that your accomplishments better fit the prophecy, Oscar's need to take his place in destiny would have consumed him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Out of jealousy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">he would have sided with the Serpent that you</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">didn't</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">side with</a>, and would appear at the end of the game to fight you to the death for the title of Chosen Undead.

<ul><li> The player characters in both games are also this. While they take part in events of the anime/manga, it's largely to make sure things go as they should be.

While it's stated that not a single human died during the war, so he can't have killed anybody, one is left only to imagine what he might have done to help his kind escape, considering he's the <em>only</em> NPC in the entire game to not only not be afraid of you, but actually taunt and trash-talk you.

<ul><li> The pilot for JLU, "Initiation", sets the stage as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>, Supergirl and Captain Atom go on a mission to a fictional North Korean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> country. Green Arrow just wanted to go home but got dragged into the story because all the other heroes were off doing other missions, and he needed a ride.
</li><li> Subsequent episodes would often include J'onn J'onzz or Mister Terrific at the monitor watching and directing various heroes around the globe doing all sorts of heroic stuff that had nothing to do with that episode's plot, especially if said plot was set primarily on the Watchtower itself.

We hardly get to see any of it. Booster's own story however ends up seeing him saving the world from a black hole and getting the girl while the other heroes are too busy fighting. He gets berated by an injured Batman at the end for abandoning his post.
</li><li> "Patriot Act" involves a crazed general giving himself super-powers to battle the League because he sees this group of superhumans, lording over them in a space station, as a potential threat to national security. He calls out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Superman</a> for a fight, but Shining Knight tells him that Superman is fighting to save a planet from an unspecified crisis, and that all the other genuine superhumans are all out doing other stuff. He ends up having to face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> and an assortment of lesser known "normal" heroes, eventually including reserve members the Crimson Avenger (who, basically, just has a gun) and Arrow's ex-sidekick Speedy (who, naturally, is just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of GA himself), the only back-up available.

</li><li> It can be quite disconcerting to look around yourself in a public place and think how everyone else is also seeing themselves as "the person looking around themselves at a bunch of strangers"
<ul><li> Which is perfectly demonstrated by <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/610/">this xkcd comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> This really depends on your point of view. Someone who may be the Hero Of Another Story to one person may be the villain in yours or their own. Likewise, you may consider yourself the villain, and thus the Hero Of Another Story the only hero there is, and only the one story - theirs.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The scientists working on Ultra (the Enigma code breakers during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>) were this for a long time to the scientists working on the Manhattan project (development of the atomic bomb). While the latter were widely recognized for their work, Ultra was kept officially secret until 1974.
</li><li> Happens to actors themselves. The supporting actors in the massive blockbuster movies are often the headliners in smaller budget movies and television.
<ul><li> This tends to happen a lot with comedians. Sometimes they're cast as a supporting character, usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a>, in massive blockbusters or just films that are more dramatic, while playing lead roles in comedy films.
</li><li> Some films cast A-list actors in supporting roles alongside A-list actors given the lead roles to further drive home the idea that the supporting characters are themselves the heroes of other stories happening just off screen; one example being the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">Supergroups</a>" in music. By definition the members all have successful solo careers and other bands, so anyone listening to, for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream">Cream</a> records, can then dig into all the Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker records.
</li><li> The White Star Line's RMS <em>Olympic</em>, older sister and running mate to the ill-fated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">Titanic</a></em>. Nicknamed "Old Reliable", she had a twenty-year career at sea, including surviving an accidental collision with a warship in 1911 and <em>running over and sinking a U-Boat</em> during World War I. She was also one of the ships who rushed to her stricken sister's side in April 1912, but was well over 500 miles away when she received the distress call. When she was 100 miles out her captain offered to offload passengers from the much smaller RMS <em>Carpathia</em>, which had picked up the survivors, but was immediately turned down by Captain Arthur Rostron, who didn't think it such a good idea to ask the survivors of the sinking to board the near-identical twin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip">the ship they had just seen die</a>. And yet, her long and stellar career is only a footnote in the story of her ill-fated sister.
