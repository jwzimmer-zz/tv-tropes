This example is also interesting in that it's the type of team described at the top of the page that's getting smashed.
</li><li> This is one of the most common complaints about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>- that players eventually start outright brawling and even <em>maiming</em> each other on the field (one player ended every game by breaking the arms of <em>every</em> quarterback he faced) and it's regarded as just "part of the game". Which it isn't.
<ul><li> The guy who breaks everyone's arms IS insanely strong, and has managed to pass it off as just being a result of that... Everything else is just unnecessary roughness, including throwing punches and even martial arts moves, not to mention linebackers throwing the small protagonist around the field.
</li><li> One of the worse offender is probably Mr. Don, the American best lineman who made a time out to declare to the audience he will kill a linebacker and then proceed to savagely tackle said linebacker. He also try to sack the quaterback out of commission like the other player in the first play. However more than the liberties about the contact rules Mr.Don is the president's son (not of the league , of the U.S.A) so he might get away with a lot.
</li><li> There is one attempt at a subversion during the Death March arc. Sena accidentally enters a tryout session for an American football club. Once he demonstrates his speed and evasion skills, the opposition get obsessed with crushing him, literally. The examiner has to point out that they would get disqualified if they tried to carry out their threats — not that Sena lets them try.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade">Bamboo Blade</a></em>, during the first practice match between Muroe High and Machido High's kendo teams, Machido fighter Yuri Ando attempts to break Muroe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KendoTeamCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KendoTeamCaptain">team captain</a> Kirino Chiba's concentration by tripping her, even after her coach (who also serves as the referee) warns her before the match to avoid using dirty tricks. Ando winds up losing the match anyway, as Kirino gets a second wind and finds a way to outsmart her.
</li><li> Subverted amusingly in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyGirl">My Girl</a></em> when Masamune decides to run barefoot in the Fathers' Relay Race at his daughter's school athletics carnival.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AskDrRin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AskDrRin">Ask Dr. Rin!</a></em>, one of the episodes had the soccer team competing against one of the other teams who made sure to showcase a lot of this, just in case you weren't convinced by a flashback earlier in the episode that showed them being jerks off the field.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em> the school Kirisaki Daiichi is known for this, except in a way that the refs won't notice.
</li><li> <em>8 Man After</em> features a scene where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> buys a football team and tries to ensure his victory by stocking the roster with cyborgs high on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Psycho Serum</a>.

The first big tackle of the game results in one burly Durovernum player jumping up and down on the head of a skinny Camulodenum player.

The Camulodenum player later takes magic potion and exacts his revenge, by this point the chaos on pitch renders the druid umpire ineffective.

</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlapShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlapShot">Slap Shot</a></em> is largely a subversion of this trope, focusing on a team that is in a huge slump until they recruit three brothers who basically just skate around beating up the other team, allowing the other players to score.

Just 15 yards, and the assistant coach getting dressed down by the head coach. Also, the impetus for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl">star girl football player</a> to come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">cheering her team on</a> to getting back on the field and kicking some butt.

The inmates of a juvenile prison play a game of football against the guards. The guards have made and will continue to make the boys' lives a living hell, including but not limited to the sexual molestation of the four main characters. The boys see this as a chance to turn the tables for one day.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books and movies (especially the latter), the Slytherin Quidditch team has a ruthless and aggressive playing style, but it's all considered part of the game. While the referee Madam Hooch winds up screaming virtually non-stop at the Slytherin team and awarding Gryffindor half a dozen penalty shots, we don't know what kind of offence would result in someone being sent off and not even the Slytherin team ever outright assault an opponent. Quidditch is an exceptionally violent and dangerous game anyway—realistically, the bludgers could quite easily kill someone.
<ul><li> According to the spinoff book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges">Quidditch Through the Ages</a></em>, there are 743 separate fouls in the game... including "Attacking one's opponent with an axe". A recurring gag is that every single foul on the list occurred in the first Quidditch World Cup, as well as several nobody thought to put <em>on</em> that list (such as one team captain sending <em>bats</em> after the opposing team and another team captain teleporting his opposite number into the middle of the Sahara).
<ul><li> There's also "the Transfiguration of a Keeper into a polecat". It's unclear whether this was done to provide an edge in a scrap, or simply render the enemy Keeper unable to use his broom.
</li><li> In fact, the actual list of what constitutes a foul has been kept secret for years for fear of "giving the players ideas."
</li><li> It's also mentioned that about 90% of the fouls can be prevented from ever happening by just not letting anyone use their wands while on the field. While it seems this would infringe one of the Wizarding World's most basic human right, the rule states that wands can't be used to attack other players, the crowd, or the balls in play, and it's perfectly legal to use them if an outside danger or interference comes up, like the time Harry used a Patronus to drive away what (he thought) were some dementors coming after him.

The Big Match at the climax of the book also has an example; <em>most</em> of A-M United realises that playing UU fairly is both good for the game and not actually that difficult, but there's a handful of real psychos seeded in there, and they're careful only to act when the ref isn't looking (linesmen haven't been introduced yet).
<ul><li> The UU team are amateurs so the professional players of A-M United have every advantage.

When Clan Ghost Bear invaded a planet with no armed forces, the local All-Star American football team challenged them instead, thinking that the Clanners wouldn't know how to play. Unfortunately for them, it turned out that the Clan Elementals, eight foot tall genetically engineered super-infantry troops, were <em>enthusiastic</em> football players. The defenders noted that despite it being a one-sided slaughter of a game, it was the cleanest match they'd ever played because the Clanners regarded personal fouls as badges of shame.

<ul><li> Where to begin? Well...closed fists, attacking before the bell, small joint manipulation, scratching, hair pulling, eye poking, facial stretches (fish hooking the mouth, bending the nose, pulling the ears), biting, airway chokes, and contact with a wrestler in contact with, below, or above the ropes, are generally considered illegal. You could watch wrestling matches constantly for 50 years and not see a single instance where any such action resulted in a disqualification. At most, a referee will just get between the two wrestlers and admonish the offending one not to do it again. Greasing your skin, groin strikes, removing your opponent's ring gear, foreign objects and outside interference generally do get the referee to call for a DQ, though. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee">If they see it happen.</a>

<ul><li> The Al Bhed Psyches kidnap Yuna to attempt to blackmail the Besaid Aurochs into throwing their game, and they also beat Wakka up so badly he collapses. Considering how absurdly high the Psyches' blitzball stats are, this comes off as unnecessary, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out that they really kidnapped Yuna to prevent her from completing her pilgrimage</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Tidus</a> can get in on the action if he figures out the Jecht Shot, which consists of bouncing the ball off the blockers' guts and back into Tidus's control, ensuring that it comes down to just Tidus and the goalie when the time comes to actually make the shot.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much the point of most Midway arcade sports games, such as <em>Arch Rivals,</em> <em>High Impact Football,</em> the <em>NFL Blitz</em> series, <em>NBA Jam</em>, etc.
<ul><li> Also the entire gameplay focus of EA's <em>Mutant League Football</em> and hockey. You can win a game by simply <em>killing the entire opposing team.</em> And the refs don't escape from the bloodbaths either.
<ul><li> <em>Mutant League Football</em> also has an inversion of this trope. By bribing the ref, he will start calling bogus penalties against the other team if it will help yours. One of the penalties that can be called is "Unnecessary <em>Kindness</em>."
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's Blood Bowl. This is what happens when you take the over-the-top ridiculous aspects of Warhammer, and replace the GRIMDARK with American Football. Based on the tabletop gaidengame, you can choose between "classic" mode (taking individual turns and rolling a crap-ton of dice like said tabletop) or "arcade" mode (standard real-time football, except instead of "downs" you play from kickoff/snap until you either score, or the enemy gets the ball and HE scores.)

They've turned soccer into something so intense the players all wear body armor. Even Bowser.

Some dirty plays involve guns and chainsaws, and most tackles are made with pro wrestling slams. You can force a forfeit by killing enough opposing players! One of the very few penalties in the game is the equivalent to unnecessary roughness: unnecessary <em>manslaughter</em>. It's rarely even called. According to Brickhead Mulligan, late hits are one of the leading causes of death for mutants over 25.

<h1>American Football</h1>
<ul><li> As noted in the page quote, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>. Unnecessary roughness is a personal foul penalty that covers a large range of actions, such as hitting a ball carrier who is already out of bounds or violent contact with a player who is away from the ball. At the professional and college levels, the foul carries a 15-yard penalty and, if the foul is committed by the defense, an automatic first down. Severe instances (such as striking blows/fisticuffs) result in player ejections.
</li><li> There's an image of Matt Millen sucker punching another player during the post game handshake. Karma eventually paid Millen back, he later became General Manager of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> Detroit Lions when they went <em>winless</em> for an entire NFL season.
<ul><li> Another incident occurred during the 1985 AFC Divisional Playoffs. After the top-seeded (at the time) Los Angeles Raiders lost to wild-card (and eventual AFC representative in Super Bowl XX) New England, Millen got into a scuffle with Patriots general manager Pat Sullivan (son of team founder Billy).
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by football running back Earl Campbell. Though he regularly ran over and through people with enough force to hear the collision over every other sound in the stadium, nothing he did was illegal.
<ul><li> Same with Larry Csonka. Most of the time. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/t232JQi.gif">He did get a 15 yard penalty once for throwing a forearm that was more like a right cross.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li></ul></li><li> There was a game between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons where, after a late hit on Mike Vick, an on field brawl started. Dispite several punches being thrown, some hard enough to knock players helmets off, no penalties were called, and no one was ejected.
</li><li> Dwayne Johnson (yes, The Rock) was recruited by the University of Miami to play football, but injuries kept him out of the starting lineup for most of his college career. His biggest moment in a game was when he became involved in a bench-clearing brawl (Miami vs. San Diego State) and was shown on ESPN chasing the San Diego mascot screaming "I'll kill you!"
</li><li> Former Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum once mused: "I like to think my best hits border on felonious assault."
</li><li> During the 1970 NFL season, the then-defending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> champion Kansas City Chiefs were playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">the Oakland Raiders</a>. Late in that game with the Chiefs leading 17-14, quarterback Len Dawson scrambled for a first-down that would have enabled the Chiefs to run out the clock, gaining additional yardage after a cheap shot from Raider defensive end Ben Davidson. It didn't end there, however, as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Taylor_(American_football)#Ben_Davidson_incident">receiver Otis Taylor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> jumped in and retaliated, resulting in offsetting penalties. Kansas City had to punt, Oakland ultimately knocked a field-goal through to deadlock the game 17-all (no regular-season overtime until 1974). Taylor's antics came back to haunt the Chiefs, as with only four postseason slots in that time, that cost Kansas City a division title and left them as the odd team out in the AFC playoffs.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxkrWKG3W8">Pittsburg Steelers Antonio Brown kicked Cleveland Browns punter in the face trying to leap over him.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Comparisons to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> were swift and immediate.
</li><li> In 2012, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/washington-redskins-offered-bounties-for-big-hits-under-former-assistant-coach-gregg-williams/2012/03/02/gIQAH0RlnR_story.html">an illicit arrangement in which Washington Redskins players were paid bonuses for deliberately injuring opposing players to take them out of the game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was discovered. They appealed the charges and won, resulting in no penalties or suspensions from the ever more vigilant NFL Executive Office. The New Orleans Saints, whose bounty-program supported by the coaching staff meant to encourage defensive players to injure opponent players in exchange for cash bonuses started the whole investigation after a pre-game speech by their defensive coordinator, Gregg Williams, before the 2011 NFC Divisional Game was leaked (in which he calls for taking their rivals' starting RB, Frank Gore, out of the game and make their starting receivers fear catching the ball by hitting them hard at the beginning of the game), ended with money fines, lost draft picks, and coach\player suspensions that at times extended to the entire 2012 season.
</li><li> While American Football as played outside North America has a reputation of being less physical (as evidenced by media commentary on the drafting of a German player without college experience along the lines of "Wait till he gets hit by an NFL tackle") rough play and injuries are a common occurrence in the European leagues as well. The fact that teams that play in "stadiums" no US High school team would be caught dead with have an ambulance on call (and facilities to allow it to drive onto the field) should tell you all you need to know.
</li><li> In November 2019, during a game between the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers, Browns defensive end Myles Garrett ripped the helmet off of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph, then <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/gLF0Xa3jc0I">hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's own helmet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The act caused Garrett to be suspended indefinitely the following day, making him miss the rest of the regular season. At the time, it was the longest suspension in NFL history for a single on-the-field action.

This has since changed dramatically and is now a twice annual fixture that generally consists of nothing <em>but</em> this trope, to the point where it has racked up the most red cards in the Premier League era and has been referred to as "the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League." This comment was made after a match in 2010 when both sides had a player sent off. Both sides are usually expected to collect at least two yellow cards apiece, and it is rare for a season to go by without at least one player being sent off in at least one of the two meetings.
</li><li> The Liverpool-Manchester United derby isn't quite as violent, but it lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> of shared family ties that the Merseyside Derby has and is the footballing equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> on the grounds that United and Liverpool are the two most successful teams in English history and the rivalry between the two cities is older than the clubs, going back most of two hundred years to the Industrial Revolution. Fans usually end up taunting one another with the Munich Air Disaster of 1958 (which essentially destroyed the legendary 'Busby Babes' United side) and the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989 (which over-crowding aggravated by police incompetence killed 96 Liverpool fans and led to the Taylor Report which enforced all seater stadia and banned fencing around fans. The youngest victim, 10 year old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was the cousin of legendary future Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard), while notable on-pitch incidents have included racial abuse by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeamMate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeamMate">Luis Suarez</a> against Patrice Evra, and John Arne-Riise absolutely destroying Alan 'Smudge' Smith's leg in such a way as to sideline him for eight months, breaking it in two places - the original estimate was twelve months, and frankly, Smith was never quite the same afterwards. The latter, unbelievably, was actually <em>by accident</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25mb3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25mb3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25mb3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Riise took a free-kick and had a left foot that regularly did passable impersonations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Mjolnir</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Poor old Smudge</a> was in the way. </span>. It should be noted that both of these happened in the last ten years. It should also be noted that the fans are generally worse than the players.
<ul><li> The Manchester United - Arsenal fixture got this reputation in the 1990's and 2000's, with one game in particular degenerating into a mass fight. It does seem to have calmed down in the second decade of the new century, though.
</li></ul></li><li> The London derby of Chelsea-Tottenham is also particularly violent, with one recent edition also devolving into a mass brawl.
</li><li> Subverted whenever a player dives, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverReaction">going over like they've been shot</a> from the very slightest contact or no contact at all. As a result of this, 'simulation' is now a bookable offence, but it can be very difficult to catch players at it.
<ul><li> However, it should also be noted that players can move at incredible speeds (the fast, Wales and Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale, has been clocked at <em>36.9 kilometres per hour</em>. <em>With</em> the ball) and even the slightest touch on their standing leg can knock them off-balance and send them flying and, well... hitting the ground at speeds that would get you a speeding ticket in most metropolitan cities isn't exactly fun. The rolling around and screaming, however, is usually faked.
</li></ul></li><li> While many soccer defenders are known for being aggressive (See <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52t5ifcmoxM">These guys<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23UQSx85Rdk">these ones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), there's a case from the 1981 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CopaLibertadores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CopaLibertadores">Copa Libertadores</a> that deserves mention: In the second game of the finals, Mario Soto from Chilean side Cobreloa was able to make two Flamengo players leave the game bleeding (the rest of Cobreloa managed to injure two other players). In the third and last game, with four minutes left and victory already guaranteed to Flamengo, the team's coach Cláudio Coutinho decided to avenge the previous game and put benchwarmer Anselmo in the field, with the sole intention of hitting Soto (who <a class="urllink" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xwnFU4zG0QM/TOubLybUKxI/AAAAAAAAB3k/fZuKt5JdUKc/s640/anselmo-soco.jpg">promptly got punched in the head<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, leading to a fight that got both players expelled).
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOtL1m1o_ok">Battle of Santiago<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Chile vs. Italy, 1962) has to be one of the finest examples. Eight years prior, there was also the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCauFkyuU6w">Battle of Bern<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Hungary vs. Brazil, 1954).
<ul><li> There's a REASON why the infamous Portugal vs. Netherlands match in the 2006 Germany World Cup was nicknamed <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nuremberg_%28association_football%29">The Battle of Nuremberg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Although many British soccer teams in the late 1960s and early 1970s had at least one player with a reputation for violent tackling and otherwise dirty playing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDamnedUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDamnedUnited">Leeds United under Don Revie</a> could fill an entire first eleven with such players, so when they met Chelsea, who had a number of similarly savage players in their first eleven, in the replay of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_FA_Cup_Final">1970 FA Cup final<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the inevitable result was one of the most violent matches in the history of the tournament (in 1997, referee David Elleray watched the match and said the two sides should have received a total of twenty yellow cards and <em>six</em> red cards):
<ul><li> Leeds' Terry Cooper and Chelsea's Tommy Baldwin were already kicking each other as the match began, while Leeds' Norman Hunter and Chelsea's Ian Hutchinson (the only player to be booked for either side in the match) spent most of the match trading punches and Leeds' Johnny Giles and Chelsea's Eddie McCreadle made numerous lunging tackles on opposing players.
</li><li> Chelsea's Ron "Chopper" Harris effectively took Leeds' Eddie Gray out of commission soon after kickoff with a savage tackle to the back of the leg, while Leeds' Jack Charlton kneed and headbutted Chelsea striker Peter Osgood.
</li><li> Leeds opened the scoring after Mick Jones viciously bundled Chelsea goalkeeper Peter Bonetti into his own goalmouth and then rounded him seconds later while he was still regaining his bearings to score, while the winner was scored by Peter Osgood after Jack Charlton, who was assigned to mark Osgood, devoted his attention instead to exacting revenge on Ian Hutchinson for a dead leg.
</li></ul></li><li> On a similar note, though Leeds United fans may remember the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_European_Cup_Final">1975 European Cup final<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mostly for some questionable refereeing decisions which denied them possible penalties (indeed, many of the club's hardcore fans refer to the club as European champions to this day), Bayern Munich fans may remember it instead for the savagery of the Leeds players which brought a premature end to the careers of <em>two</em> of their players. Three minutes into the match, a particularly vicious tackle by Terry Yorath on Bjorn Andersson led to the latter having to be substituted and only playing a further handful of matches at senior level. Uli Hoeness, who described the tackle on Andersson as "the most brutal foul I think I have ever seen", was himself taken out of the match after a tackle by Frank Gray resulted in a serious knee injury from which he never fully recovered.
</li><li> In the 1980s, Wimbledon took on this mantle during an era when they were known as "the Crazy Gang". One opponent told the newspapers that he expected every team to have a hard man, but he'd never known a team to entirely consist of hard men.
<ul><li> Wimbledon's reputation was enhanced by the notorious and direct tackle committed by hard nut enforcer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Vinnie Jones</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bhsd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bhsd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bhsd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> who has since found fame as an actor playing hard-man roles</span> when he memorably shut down Newcastle and England striker Paul Gascoigne... <a class="urllink" href="http://cahiersdufootball.net/blogs/teenage-kicks/files/2014/09/paul-gascoigne-and-vinnie-jones-7329679761.jpg">with<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>!
</li></ul></li><li> Still on soccer, we have Brazilian defender <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8x5sRGn3k4">Júnior Baiano<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He reached memetic levels for his violent, reckless tackles. In the early nineties. Before internet was popular.
</li><li> 1982 World Cup semi-final, West Germany v France: Late in the game French player Patrick Battiston was advancing on goal when German keeper Harald Schumacher ran out and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqYEpVjpinI">smashed him in the face with his forearm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Battiston was knocked cold and taken to hospital with broken teeth and a damaged vertebra. Schumacher was not even booked and saved two penalties in the resultant shoot-out. Justice was done in the final as West Germany lost to Italy, and Schumacher later offered to pay Battiston's dental bill.
<ul><li> 32 years later, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERtmPK7ve9c">another German goalkeeper hit an advancing striker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the final with Argentina. And yet that wasn't the biggest moment of violence - mostly committed by the Argentinians, who seemed intent in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyzsw4qt6y8">getting Bastian Schweinsteiger out in a stretcher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2014 World Cup quarter final between Brazil and Colombia, a record 54 fouls happened (with only 4 yellow cards, showing the referee was condescending). The defeated Colombians had both the game's punching bag in James Rodriguez (who even managed to get a penalty kick, which he scored) and the dirtiest player in Juan Zuñiga (<a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/mtesperon/status/485211893561577472">who stomped Hulk's knee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and kneed Neymar's back, breaking his vertebra and sidelining the striker from the remaining games).
</li><li> In the first round of the 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> women's soccer tournament, the US was playing Colombia. Partway through the game, one of the US players, Abby Wambach, collapsed on the field, clutching her face and kicking her legs in apparent agony. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">the penchant for theatrics in the sport</a>, the commentators sounded somewhat skeptical - up until she removed her hands from her face and sat up, revealing that her right eye was rapidly swelling shut. As it turned out, she was running down the field ahead of a Colombian player, Lady Andrade. When Wambach slowed down, Andrade came up next to her and <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCMyvd12i3o">sucker punched her in the eye<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</em> Amazingly, the referee missed it completely - through Andrade did not get away with it. The US requested that FIFA review the footage after the game, and they have since banned Andrade from her next two matches - which amounts to an Olympic ban as Colombia failed to win any of their group games and did not advance to the next stage.
</li><li> A "friendly" match between Portugal and England in May 2016 saw <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxR7MoVHXCg">Bruno Alves jump-kicking Harry Kane in the head<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> One Mexican championship game had <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyWrmbAe75g">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">vasectomy</a> tackle".
</li><li> Former Real Madrid defender Pepe is an infamous example of this. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKt4IBxD5oo">During the 2008-2009 season La Liga home match against Getafe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, after committing a foul by pushing Javi Casquemiro down in the penalty box, he then kicked the already down Getafe striker twice, pushed his head on the grass <em>and</em> stamped on him several times. Then in the following brawl, he punched another Getafe player's face before having to get escorted off the pitch by his team mate as he received a red card. In the aftermath of this match, Pepe received a <em>ten game suspension</em>, which is a record length in the history of La Liga.
<ul><li> Another Real defender, Sergio Ramos, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnF_guJHPeE">also tends to be violent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Most notably, he basically won the 2018 Champions League Final against Liverpool, first by dislocating star Liverpool striker Mohammed Salah's arm in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi7fXtGTwbc">a judo flip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (and not just that - an <em>illegal</em> judo flip. Actual judoka commenting on the match made that very explicit) and then by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhuiH-b0DbM">elbowing goalkeeper Karius in the side of the head<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Karius was later diagnosed with concussion and subsequently went from a confident keeper with the best defensive record in the Champion's League, holding Real at bay to making two of the worst howlers in Champion's League history (he conceded a third goal, but it's generally accepted that <em>no one</em> would have stopped Bale's bicycle kick) in the following minutes. Ramos, meanwhile, got away clean with another winner's medal.
</li><li> To make matters worse, Karius looked so miserable afterwards that no one could bear to blame him: when he went to the Liverpool fans to beg forgiveness, they responded by singing the club anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone' at him.]] While Salah recovered and Liverpool went on to win the Champion's League the next year - in Madrid, no less - Karius was not so lucky. Instead, he went from a promising (if raw) young keeper with a bright future in one of the most exciting young teams on the planet to a shattered wreck who even after the departure of Liverpool's other senior goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, dropped down the pecking order to become Liverpool's third, or even fourth, choice goalkeeper behind the newly acquired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Alisson Becker</a> and Adrian, going out on loan to increasingly obscure clubs in the Turkish League. It's got to the point where even his most staunch critics among the Liverpool fanbase just feel kind of sorry for him.

<ul><li> In the NBA, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edb6bz_C9ms">Bruce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THGJJHln4Co">Bowen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was notorious for being the league's dirtiest player after the rules were cleaned up and more anti-defense following the Jordan Era.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Washington#Infamous_punch">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> details the Rudy Tomjanovich-Kermit Washington incident from December 1977:
<div class="indent"> "Washington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a roundhouse punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8 mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a watermelon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. [...] Reporters heard the sound of the punch all in the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief. [...] besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it" and likened the surgery to Scotch taping together a badly shattered eggshell."
</div><ul><li> Washington's career slowly petered out into early retirement afterwards, while Rudy T went on to coach the Houston Rockets to two NBA Championships in the mid-90s. And Kevin Kunnert, who by most accounts started the brawl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">got off with neither injury nor punishment</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> We seem to have found a replacement for Bowen in the 2009 NBA playoffs: Rajon Rondo. To the extent that for a while, his nickname was Rajon Wound-o.
<ul><li> During the 2009 Bulls-Celtics playoffs during game five, Rajon Rondo fishhooked Brad Miller's face as Miller went for a layup. Rondo's hand was three feet away from the ball, and all Rondo got was a personal foul. He should have drawn a flagrant one at least. Official review upheld the decision. (Because to do otherwise would be like going on national television and saying, "Bulls, we may have cost you guys the game.") Can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6JpEx_CqOc">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> How about game 6 of the same Bulls-Celtics series—namely, Rondo grabbing Kirk Hinrich and <em>throwing him into the scorer's table</em> with the ball nowhere near.
</li></ul></li><li> A few years back, Oklahoma and Baylor were playing a basketball game with Baylor ahead and Blake Griffin threw a Baylor player down to the ground and started to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> on the court. Amazingly enough, a technical wasn't called on Griffin but the other player instead. This terrible call ended up leading to an Oklahoma comeback and no sort of reprimand for Griffin.
</li><li> The Boston Celtics' Kevin McHale once <em>clotheslined</em> Kurt Rambis to keep him from getting a basket, as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7r6vXeOfyQ">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It says a lot about the NBA at the time vs the NBA of today that he didn't even get a foul. Hell, that the commentators say they were expecting something like that to happen sooner or later (it was a playoff game between bitter rival teams), and describe "knocking your guy on his ass" as a legitimate strategy.
</li><li> In college basketball, Duke University's Grayson Allen has become synonymous for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cTs4zpI3CQ">tripping opponents<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul><p></p><h1>Ice hockey</h1>
<ul><li> There's an old joke about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a>'s general level of violence: "I went to a brawl and then a hockey game broke out"
<ul><li> Similar to American football, ice hockey has a catch-all penalty for dirty play, "roughing." This penalty can range from "callous disregard of safety when skating into your opponent" to "intentionally firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag">a solid piece of vulcanized rubber</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47sd1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47sd1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47sd1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That would be the puck</span> at your opponent's face." There's also the similarly intentionally vague "game misconduct" penalty, which is basically the hockey term for being ejected from the game.
</li><li> And of course, the actual fistfights, which happen quite often, and in fact, are considered a major part of the game. The penalty for a fight is five minutes, which applies to both players. It's rather telling that there's a specific penalty called just for "fighting" and the only punishment is that five minute trip to the box. Other sports would charge players openly fighting with violating more generalized personal misconduct rules and almost certainly eject them.
</li><li> One of the various Unofficial roles in a Hockey team is the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Goon</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Enforcer</a>" who's entire job is to stop Unnecessary Roughness by the other team, mostly by the threat of beating anyone who tries into a paste, especially if said roughness was directed at a star player.
</li></ul></li><li> Sportswriter/comedian Sean McIndoe wrote <a class="urllink" href="http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/51459/the-seven-levels-of-dirty-hockey">The Seven Levels of Dirty Hockey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where the lowest is annoying the adversary (i.e. skating close to the goalie to cover him in ice) and the other six deal with fighting - with the top one being an assault that has no reason than "I am going to try to end that guys season". Among them is the following example, "at the risk of permanently losing my Canadian passport"...
</li><li> A very common accusation from the Soviets during the 1972 Summit series, exacerbated by the frou-frou no contact rules of Russian Hockey, as opposed to the genuine physicality of proper North American Hockey, Soviet players, unprepared for any serious checking, were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub">trying heavily to avoid the parts of hockey they couldn't compete in</a> and only playing the way <em>they</em> wanted to play.
<ul><li> Half the series was played in Canada, and the other half in the Soviet Union. Overseas, the Canadian team suffered from a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">Can't Get Away with Nuthin'</a>, while the Soviets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">had the Russian referees on their side</a>, despite an agreement to use neutral Swiss umpires to judge the game. The Canadians may have played a more physical game than the Russians were expecting, but they were called on it on both sides of the Pacific, and especially in the USSR.
</li></ul></li><li> Claude Lemieux was one of the most loathed players in NHL History (no relation to Mario, one of the most loved), and with good reason. Most agree that he single-handedly started the Avalanche/Red Wings rivalry in 1996 for a pretty vicious cheap shot on Kris Draper.
</li><li> The Philadelphia Flyers for some time in the 1970's were known as "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers#1972.E2.80.931978:_The_Broad_Street_Bullies">Broad Street Bullies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" - a team so violent that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> included it among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryOfTheDamned">Jury of the Damned</a> in one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Halloween Episode</a>.
<ul><li> The invincible juggernaut Soviet team almost backed out of playing them on their U.S. tour in 1976 after an especially vicious hit.
</li></ul></li><li> On February 18 2004, Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche checked Vancouver Canucks captain Markus Naslund in the head, giving him a concussion when he hit the ice, and no penalty was called. Two games later, Canucks enforcer Todd Bertuzzi clubbed Moore from behind, knocking him to the ice. The Avalanche jumped on Bertuzzi, breaking three of Moore's cervical vertebrae and giving him a concussion when they all fell on him. Moore has not played since, and would later sue Bertuzzi for damages (which was settled out of court). Bertuzzi pled guilty to assault causing bodily harm and got probation, and was suspended from playing hockey for 17 months.
</li><li> Behold, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIcdbxzrtbI">Vancouver Canucks versus Calgary Flames, January 18, 2014<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The second the puck hits the ice, instead of going for the puck, the Flames <em>tackle</em> the Canucks, who respond in kind with fists. Notably, <em>The Flames were planning this</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Vancouver saw it coming</a> as Calgary started the game with their Fourth line, leading them to respond in kind, expecting dirty play. Similar events happen enough for there to be a term for it, "line brawl".
</li><li> Funnily enough though, the Vancouver/Calgary fight is <em>not</em> a line brawl notable enough to get its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> entry, no, that dubious honor goes to these five fights (in chronological order):
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Massacre">The Good Friday Massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1984 between heated rivals Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques, particularly notable as some players didn't find out they were ejected until after the intermission, prompting them to start more fights to take other players out with them.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-up_in_Piestany">Punch-up in Piestany<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a bench-clearing brawl between the Canadian and Soviet teams in the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships that lasted for <em>20 minutes</em> and had the officials literally turn out the lights on the arena to try and stop the brawl. Both teams ended up disqualified from the championships, which cost Canada a guaranteed bronze and possibly better (which led to speculation that the Soviets, who were already eliminated from contention, and had cleared the bench first, deliberately did so to sabotage Canada's chances).
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche-Detroit_Red_Wings_brawl">1997 Avalanche/Red Wings brawl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, aka the Brawl in Hockeytown, which was the culmination of the rivalry that started with the aforementioned Lemieux/Draper incident. Notable both for drawing a lot of blood on the ice (leading to another nickname, Bloody Wednesday), but also for leading to <em>another</em> fight almost exactly a year later (and combined produced two of the greatest goaltender fights in hockey). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5bouh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5bouh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5bouh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This technically makes the Avs the only team to get multiple entries, as they were previously the Quebec Nordiques</span>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers-Ottawa_Senators_brawl">The 2004 Flyers/Senators brawl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which <em>still</em> holds the record for most penalty minutes awarded for a fight.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins-New_York_Islanders_brawl">The Penguins/Islanders brawl in 2011<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an act of revenge on the Islanders' part after a previous game left one of their players concussed and the Penguin that did it unpunished.
</li></ul></li><li> It takes something especially heinous to have the incident overshadow the fact that a rule was named after them, but Marty McSorley (he of the McSorley rule) managed it when he viciously slashed Donald Brashear from behind, clocking him in the head and knocking his helmet off, causing Brashear to have a seizure on the ice and a Grade III concussion. It resulted in charges for assault with a weapon for McSorley (which ended with a suspended sentence) and ended McSorley's career.
</li></ul><p></p><h1>Other sports</h1>
<ul><li> The 1956 Hungary-Soviet Olympic water polo match is a classic example of this trope. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_In_The_Water_match">The other wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has details, but the simple fact that it's known as the "Blood in the Water match" gives an idea of what happened.
</li><li> In a 2008 Tae-kwon-do Olympic match, one Cuban competitor got so angry at losing that he kicked the umpire's face. You can see the picture <a class="urllink" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3056/2791042840_bd4123a23b.jpg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, and the video <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYg-VqSB9M#t=45s">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RugbyIsSlaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RugbyIsSlaughter">its reputation</a>, it should come as no surprise that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">Rugby Union</a> has its share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples.
<ul><li> Eye-gouging. It's a serious offense that will get you banned from the sport for weeks, months or even <em>years</em> depending on its severity - justifiably so, because players can and <em>have</em> lost their eyesight because of it.
</li><li> Several famous examples happened in tours of the British and Irish Lions:
<ul><li> The 99 call - code for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">everyone, beat the crap out of the nearest opposition player</a>" used in the 1974 tour of South Africa. The matches in that tour was notoriously filled with violence, and the Lions captain Willie McBride came up with the call so that when <em>one</em> Lions player retaliates, <em>all</em> players retaliate. It succeeded, because the referee couldn't identify a single instigator and send him off. (Nowadays, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">video replays</a> would mean these kind of tactics will just result in the whole team getting banned.)
</li><li> NSW Waratahs fullback Duncan McBride <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj-F0NyHt7c">punching<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">Lions flyhalf Ronan O'Gara while he's down</a>, in a match between the Lions and the regional team New South Wales Waratahs during the 2001 tour of Australia. It was so vicious, it spawned a rumour that O'Gara had slept with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McRae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McRae">Mc Rae</a>'s wife. McRae received a red card and a 7-week ban, but he didn't miss any matches since it happened during the off-season.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVhckB3juk">The "clear out"/"spear tackle"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (depending on whom you ask) by New Zealand captain Tana Umaga and hooker Keven Mealamu on Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll, during 2005 tour of New Zealand. O'Driscoll dislocated his shoulder because of it, ending his tour, and commentators observed that it could have killed him. The Lions subsequently lost the series 0-3 while Umaga and Mealamu received no sanctions. Even now, this incident is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">Flame Bait</a> for rugby fans and everyone has different opinions on the degree to which it was intentional, what penalty (if any) it should have incurred and the effect it had on the whole tour.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>, players can be reported for "Rough Conduct" (formerly "Unduly Rough Play"), which covers any incident that isn't a specific offence (such as striking)
<ul><li> A case of this is why AFL now has trial by video, in 1985, then-Hawthorn captain Leigh Matthews broke opposing player Neville Bruns' jaw behind the play, sparking a brawl in which he himself received a broken nose. Because it was behind the play the umpires weren't watching, but it was caught on film, showing the brutality of the hit. The public were outraged and the AFL, responded by bringing in the AFL Match Review Panel. Matthews retired at the end of the season and was criminally prosecuted for assault, being initially convicted but later having it quashed on appeal.
</li></ul></li><li> 1996 Olympics, Brazil-Cuba in the women's volleyball semifinal (ESPN Brazil even <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6APbfY2VkDk">made a documentary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on that game). Seeing the adversary build an advantage, Cuba resorts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a>, spitting, and all sorts of intimidation. Once the Cubans win the hard-fought game in tie-breaker set, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WEj6h_I9oM#t=427s">a brief scrum happens in-court<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (helped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">"tough gal" attitude continuing, making the Brazilians fed up</a>) and reportedly continued on the way to the dressing rooms. Though Cuban star Regla Torres denied punching a Brazilian - Torres declared the game had her so fired up\pissed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">"that if I had punched Ana Paula that day, she would've never played volleyball again!"</a>.
<ul><li> This is also a more serious threat than one might imagine; volleyball is a non-contact sport and has a less-than-tough reputation, but top female volleyball players can spike the ball at about 100 kilometres per hour, and top male players at almost 130. A punch from a volleyball player is no joke.
</li></ul></li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Baseball</a> can get in on this:
<ul><li> Pitchers hitting players with the ball (usually a 100+ MPH fastball) earns the hit batter an automatic advancement to first base. That is, if the batter doesn't then charge the mound, swing a few punches at the pitcher, and incite a bench-clearing brawl among both teams, which isn't as rare as it sounds.
</li><li> There's also the numerous baserunners who have used their cleats as weapons of war. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Ty Cobb</a> was particularly famous for this.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> world champion Michael Schumacher had a pair of these incidents in his early career - first at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, where he attempted to force Damon Hill off the track, breaking Hill's suspension and putting them both out of the race and granting him the championship, and again at the 1997 European Grand Prix where he attempted the same move, ramming his car into Jacques Villeneuve to keep him from finishing the race. The latter move was in fact so blatant that when Villeneuve was able to pull away leaving Schumacher beached in the gravel with broken steering, commentator Martin Brundle remarked simply "That didn't work, Michael; you hit the wrong part of him," and it lead to Schumacher being disqualified from the entire season.
