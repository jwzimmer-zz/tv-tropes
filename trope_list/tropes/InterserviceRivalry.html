</p><p>The world is not perfect.
</p><p>One of the reasons for this not happening is usually Interservice Rivalry, where at least two branches of the government don't work well together, sometimes openly opposing and working against each other. Usually if the leaders of said branches know each other, they can't let go of their past feelings and it intensifies the rivalry. Often in military fiction (and in real life as well), some amount of Interservice Rivalry will be encouraged by the higher-ups, to promote a competitive spirit, but sometimes it can get out of hand. Sometimes it is even used by a dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster-type</a> leader to maintain control. That way, if the army ever rebels against him, he can always call in the navy to fight for him.

For some reason, Section 1 finds the concept of cyborg little girls used as a death squad somehow <em>weird</em>. Because Section 1 consists of adult male human operatives, who are not happy about being upstaged by half-mechanical little girls.
</li><li> Various divisions of the TSAB in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>. In particular, the Ground Forces' commander hates Riot Force 6 (which is a cross-service special forces battalion assigned to a paramilitary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> control division). The fact that the commander and half of RF6's staff are former criminals that one member of the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship">blasted into submission</a> does not help.

<ul><li> Divisions of Mithril. Intelligence and operatives in particular. That was probably the main reason why Sōsuke was reluctant to leave Kaname protected by Wraith (who was from Intelligence).
</li><li> In <em>The Second Raid</em> Melissa Mao tells the story of how she escaped from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> by joining the U.S. Marine Corps, marching into the recruitment office <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayBride">still wearing her wedding dress</a>. The recruiters were reluctant to sign her up until Mao revealed that her father was a Colonel in the Air Force, at which point they welcomed her into the Corps purely to annoy him.
</li></ul></li><li> The Public Security Division and the Kerberos Unit have an intense one going on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JinRohTheWolfBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JinRohTheWolfBrigade">Jin-Roh</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>, as the rivalry is escalating at a worrying rate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, the entire plot was brought about by it; Kei is really a Public Security agent and her romance with Fuse was staged to try and create a fake scandal that would let the PSD shut down the Kerberos Unit. Unfortunately for them, Kerberos know about the scheme and out-manipulate the PVD, killing Kei and several other agents while blackmailing the PVD into standing down.</span>
</li><li> The various geographical units of the Amestris military in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> evidence this. Soldiers from the Northern (Briggs), Central, and East forces (the ones shown so far) never lack for snide things to say about every unit aside from theirs.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>, Isval flashbacks show some animosity towards the State Alchemists when they arrived, as some among the regular soldiers felt they'd been sent to die for nothing when the Fuhrer could have just called in these guys from the beginning and ended the campaign <em>seven years</em> sooner.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>. Their own government and other branches of service are a far greater threat to Section 9 than any external enemy could ever hope to be.
</li><li> <em>All over the place</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaoChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaoChan">Mao-chan</a></em>, where the heads of the three branches of the defense force are all old friends... who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">constantly competing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">often viciously</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, most other branches of law enforcement seem to dislike the Hellsing Organization. At one point the SAS clash with Hellsing over jurisdiction over a case involving Incognito, resulting in an entire SAS squadron being captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.

In the anime, it's between the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of <em>Environment</em>. The Defense Ministry fields <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">normal soldiers</a> equipped with special technology to fight supernaturals, while the Environment Ministry fields operatives recruited from ancient exorcist families. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadStarWalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadStarWalking">The ''real'' main characters are the Environment guys</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Even between said exorcist families there are some serious feuds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">driving Kagura into becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em>, the more normal sort of militaries don't like the eponymous girls (probably something to do with them being underaged aces who fly without their pants on). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There is even a conspiracy within the military to disband the 501st.</span>
<ul><li> Actually, most soldiers and officers are very friendly and supportive towards the Witches because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a>. Only very conservative generals are reluctant to rely on Witches. However, a straight forward interservice rivalry exists among different branches armed forces.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em> is in a branch of an organization designed to capture Witches, using magic-resistant tranq guns. Another branch of the <em>same organization</em> breaks in and steals the gun tech. Meanwhile, a <em>third</em> branch is trying to keep the <em>second</em> branch under control, while trying to assassinate the members of the <em>first</em> branch. This is not helped by the fact that all of the branches use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">same helmets and equipment</a>.
</li><li> Some divisions of the Gotei 13 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a> have this, especially the 4th and 11th divisions; the former views the latter as a gang of violent thugs and the latter views the former as weak and useless in battle. When Ichigo and Ganju take Hanataro of the 4th Division hostage, the 11th Division <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> pursuing them laugh it off.
</li><li> This crops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YomigaeruSoraRescueWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YomigaeruSoraRescueWings">Yomigaeru Sora  Rescue Wings</a></em>; the local Fire Department insists on using their light helicopter to rescue a stranded cable car, even though they're told that the winds are too high for the chopper, purely so that they don't have to call in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">Komatsu Air Rescue Squadron</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a>: Roberta's Blood Trail</em> inflamed a behind-the-scenes rivalry between the NSA and CIA over jurisdictions from South America to the Southeast Pacific. Had Roberta not intervened and become <em>everyone</em>'s problem, Roanapur probably would've come under pressure from the upstart agency. As it was, the CIA, and their interests in Roanapur, were able to maintain the status quo.
</li><li> Between the three army branches (Military Police Brigade, Survey Corps and Garrison) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. The three view each other with suspicion to the point that the (corrupt) Police Brigade thinks the Survey Corps wants <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Rogue Titan aka Eren</span> to seize power from the inner circle from them. It doesn't help that there is a distinction between the highly regarded Police Brigade and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> Survey Corps who do most of the fighting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, this was the problem with Zeon flat out. Everyone was trying to top everyone else, leading to double crosses, delays in important supplies, rivalries between <em>production lines</em> and, ultimately, the loss of good pilots. A microcosm of this happens with Ramba Ral: when he lost his Gouf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mobile suit</a>, he requested the new model Dom as a replacement. Unfortunately, the man in charge of requisitions was M'Quve, who served under a different commander<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0umjn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0umjn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0umjn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ral served under Dozle Zabi, M'Quve under Kycilia</span> and refused Ral's request purely for political reasons. As a result, Ral lead a desperate guerilla attack on White Base that resulted in his death. Had he gotten the Doms, he could have potentially defeated the Gundam — if not alone, then he could have teamed up with the Black Tri-Stars (another group of ace pilots) and won with ease; instead, the Tri-Stars were picked off one by one, as Amuro had become an even better pilot by the time they showed up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em>, the Lusitanian military and the clergymen/Temple Knights don't get along since the military does most of the fighting while the clergymen get to take the spoils of war despite not being on the front lines. The rivalry is fueled by the mutual dislike between their leaders, Lord Guiscarl and Archbishop Bodin.
</li><li> Kazuma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Konosuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Konosuba">Konosuba</a></em> exploits one of these when collections agents come to get back taxes from all the adventurers in town. Reasoning that government and law enforcement agencies never enjoy anyone butting in on their turf, Kazuma gets himself thrown in jail knowing that the town guard will not let the agents near him while he is being processed, allowing him to get away with tax evasion.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> Corps in general has had a number of inter-service rivalries, notably with rival interstellar police agencies the L.E.G.I.O.N. and the Darkstars, and (to varying degrees) with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">various other Lantern Corps</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSiege">The Siege</a></em> uses the trope extensively. For one, FBI Special Agent Hubbard (Washington's character) refuses to share information with CIA agent "Elise Kraft"/Sharon Bridger (Bening's character) without an official directive from his agency. Later, when the CIA kidnaps a suspect (whom the FBI wants for questioning) on U.S. soil, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hubbard's team raids the CIA safehouse where said suspect is kept and actually arrests the agents, including Elise, <em>at gunpoint</em></span>.

And then, during the last third of the movie, there is a severe case of interservice rivalry between the FBI and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Army, after martial law is declared in New York</span>, although it's likely that Hubbard has gone rogue and is acting alone at that point.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsGalacticEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsGalacticEmpire">Galactic Empire</a>, the "mystics"  Dark Side users like Darth Vader, other agents such as the Inquisitors, etc.  and the regular Imperial military don't get along well: the mystics treat the regular military as expendable lackeys, and the regular military isn't happy about this, or about being ordered around in general by Dark Side users outside the regular chain of command. Some of them can get along on an individual basis, though: both Vader and Tarkin respected each other as men who could get results. Despite this, Dark Side Imperials are so feared that the regular military's hands are tied once they show up.
</li><li> There's also a rivalry between the Imperial Navy (space fleets) and Imperial Army (ground forces), but it's much less pronounced. Apparently the Navy considers itself superior to the Army as expendable grunts, i.e. in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> film, when Han gets kicked out of Tie Fighter flight academy for insubordination, he's punished by being transferred into the regular Army, where he ends up fighting in muddy trench warfare.
</li><li> The rivalry between mystics and regular military extends into the Empire's successor state, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsTheFirstOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsTheFirstOrder">The First Order</a>. Starting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, we see the rivalry between the Dark Side wielder Kylo Ren, and General Hux of the regular military: once again, the "mystic" Kylo doesn't even hold a formal rank, but as the right hand of the Supreme Leader, he orders everyone <em>including</em> Hux around. <em>Unlike</em> Vader, however, Hux openly disagrees with Kylo on numerous occasions, and Supreme Leader Snoke treats them like bickering children rather than siding with one or the other. As for why Kylo doesn't just kill Hux, he's actually Snoke's top military commander, more akin to his Tarkin than his Admiral Ozzel, so he can't (their power dynamic is sort of like if Vader and Tarkin <em>didn't</em> get along well).
<ul><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>, there's a clear split between Kylo and his "Knights of Ren" and the regular military, but there aren't nearly as many Force-wielders as there were during the Empire (they're more like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>). But when the Sith Eternal forces of the Final Order on Exegol reveal themselves, this trope comes to the forefront once again. At the First Order high command meeting about joining their forces, Admiral Quinn interjects that he's not sure if they should trust them, as they're a bunch of "cultists and conjurors". Kylo responds by Force-choking him and slamming him into the ceiling (a complicated example though: Kylo is himself a "conjuror" and might have been insulted at that, but at the same time, he privately doesn't trust the Sith Eternal either, but wants to seize power <em>over</em> them to use their resources in securing his hold on the rest of the galaxy).
</li></ul></li><li> In both the Empire and the First Order, there's actually sort of a three-way split between the "mystics", the regular military, and the R&amp;D divisions working on superweapons  such as the Death Star and Starkiller Base. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, Admiral Motti insisted that the Death Star was more powerful than General Tagge's regular military, <em>and</em> scoffed at Vader for his "sorcerer's ways" (and was promptly Force-choked by Vader). Tarkin also loosely fell into the "R&amp;D" camp in the sense that he prioritized the Death Star over the regular military. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Rebels</a></em> cartoon series, we see a clear contrast between Tarkin and Grand Admiral Thrawn  who sees superweapons as gimmicky and inefficient, and would rather put those extensive resources towards improving their regular military units on a strategic level: the resources they blew on the Death Star could have built entire <em>fleets</em> of TIE Defenders, which are basically just a more powerful TIE Fighter capable of engaging X-Wings on equal footing.
<ul><li> In the First Order, we see this three-way split as well: in <em>The Force Awakens</em> Hux sort of straddled the line between regular military and R&amp;D (a bit like Tarkin, as he's in charge of their new superweapon), but by <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, Allegiant General Pryde openly scorns him that the resources spent on Starkiller Base could have been spent on a larger fleet of Star Destroyers, instead of putting all their eggs in one basket. General Pryde is a bit of an odd case though, as he's a regular military commander who dislikes superweapons  but who is deeply loyal to "mystic" Emperor, and disagrees with Admiral Quinn about trusting them (Quinn is more the "straightforward military" guy).

There's also a fair amount of jockeying between X-wing pilots and A-wing pilots. A-wings are very pleased with the speed of their crafts and bring it up every chance they get. The accepted response is to ask, "What killed the Death Stars, again?"
</li><li> Also, between X-wing pilots and Y-wing ones. Y-wings are outdated and rough-edged, and the pilots less expertly trained, but make up a good portion of the Republic fighter force. Probably doesn't help that Horton Salm, the local Y-wing commander, is a strict, mostly by-the-book officer, as compared to Wedge Antilles, who takes a more laid-back approach to leadership.

Cooperation at any level higher than having a few shapers aboard a warship to keep it running is a laborious process overseen by the intendants, who have their own internal politics to consider... and that's not even considering the rivalries between different domains in the same caste. The only reason this isn't more of a disaster is that the usual Vong reaction to a fiasco <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">is to execute both offending domains</a>.

The broke and understaffed Baltimore City police would love nothing more than the FBI taking over a case or two. Unfortunately, the FBI's superiors are only concerned with terrorism investigations, rather than the drugs and crimes that plague Baltimore — although a certain degree of under the table assistance is rendered by sympathetic FBI agents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Air Force characters have made several references to an ongoing rivalry with their Marine coworkers (and, less frequently, their scientist coworkers).
</li><li> There's also a constant rivalry with the N.I.D about who gets what piece of alien technology.
</li><li> For the most part, though, interservice rivalry is implausibly averted. The USAF's technical expertise seems only exceeded by its success in defending its budget. Even though each service would have compelling arguments for an equal or superior share of a joint command, the Army (U.S. Army Special Forces, most missions call for infantry more than anything) and Navy (expertise running large vessels called "ships," the USMC, Navy SEALs) departments evidently are happy to let the Air Force run the show. The fact that the SGC is still not a joint command after 10+ years is one of the greatest triumphs in the history of Pentagon politics.
</li><li> In another implausible aversion, the Air Force operates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a>, for the most part using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">typical Space Navy terminology</a>. Arguably, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Air Force would more likely classify "starships" as aircraft which just <em>happen</em> to be very, very large. Use of Navy terminology simply poses the unwanted question of why the Navy isn't more heavily involved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum">Stargate Continuum</a></em>, Carter and Mitchell both make faces when Landry implies that if their universe gets a Stargate program, it will be run by the Navy.

For example, the plot of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSumOfAllFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSumOfAllFears">The Sum of All Fears</a></em> was altered to have terrorists merely severely damage a U.S. aircraft carrier, as opposed to sinking/destroying it outright. In one SG-1 episode, the Goa'uld destroy an entire U.S. Navy carrier battle group... which the <em>Department of the Air Force</em> technical advisors evidently had no problem with! FWIW, "destroyed by Aliens" may be less a problem for the military in general, than "destroyed by the Russians".

</li><li> Odo, also an officer of the Militia (based on his uniform if nothing else), has his own way of doing things and very much dislikes it when Starfleet tries to insert itself in his work, whether by actively interfering or forcing him to work according to their legal code. He even tries to resign at the beginning of season three when a lieutenant commander from Starfleet Security is assigned to the station, and humiliates Worf for wrecking an undercover operation after the latter was repeatedly told to leave it alone (Worf was chief of security in his last post, but is now part of the station's strategic planning staff).

Almost immediately, when the Army hears air raid sirens and takes cover (not knowing that the air raids never take place on their side of the island), the marines happily raid their supplies for newer rifles, better food, and some luxuries like fancy shoes, cigars, and liquor. Later episodes also feature some Marines/Seabees rivalry, although that has more to do with the Seabees being noncombatants than anything else.

<ul><li> Army vs. Navy in NCAA college football — or <em>anything else</em>:
<ul><li> Neither West Point or the US Naval Academy have been serious contenders in the NCAA for decades, but the rivalry is so notorious that it's one of the most anticipated games of the football season. It is traditionally held the weekend after the conference championship games and serves as both the last game of the regular season and the last game until the bowl games and playoffs begin in late December.
</li><li> The US Navy's official song "Anchors Aweigh" is about the Navy beating the army in the Army vs Navy football game.
</li><li> And with perhaps <em>slightly</em> less intensity whenever Army or Navy plays Air Force; the Air Force simply hasn't been around as long, so the rivalry hasn't truly had a chance to really <em>fester</em>, you know? Even though the Air Force Academy has won <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief%27s_Trophy">the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> more often than either of its opponents, The Army-Navy Game is still the one taken the <em>most</em> seriously. So seriously, in fact, that despite the fact that neither Army nor Navy have been truly relevant to the college football championship scene in years, their game is still considered one of the premier rivalry games in the nation.
</li></ul></li><li> Lower on the rungs of College Sports in Division III, the United States Coast Guard Academy faces the Merchant Marine Academy every year for the Secretaries Cup (formerly known as the "Secretary's Cup", when the two academies were both part of the Department of Transportation. Now that the Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, the name has been pluralized.)
</li><li> Across the pond, teams from the British Army and Royal Navy play a rugby match against each other every year. There are also interservice sports events in other sports as well, such as cricket and association football.
</li><li> It happens between countries too (having sports teams face-off is so much easier than war!), as America's West Point and Canada's Royal Military College have hockey games when their regular-season schedules allow them to.

<ul><li> Delta Green and MJ-12 used to have this in the short period where both officially worked for the US government. The rivalry continued after Delta Green was disbanded, although more hostile and lethal.
</li><li> The new sourcebooks feature <em>two</em> Delta Greens; the Special Access Program, a reactivated, officially sanctioned version, and "the Cowboys", DG Agents who refused to come in from the cold and thus operate as vigilantes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> has eight service groups: Armed Forces, Central Processing Unit (the bureaucracy), HPD&amp;MC (housing and "mind control" - propaganda), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Internal Security</a> (who does policing work too), Production, Logistics and Commissary (food vats, outfitting), Power Services (Power is power!), R&amp;D (Research and Design) and Technical Services. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">They all work for the smooth running of Alpha Complex</a>.

</li><li> Speaking of Commies, the Commie-run Alpha State has eight similar groups, <em>all</em> of which have their own official espionage arms attached (parodying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> situation in the USSR, see that section).
</li><li> Then there's the Troubleshooters, whose members continue to work for their original service group between missions. Many others get jealous, as it's interesting (albeit dangerous) work and can be a fast track to promotion.

<ul><li> The various chapters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Space Marines</a> in occasionally develop rivalries.
<ul><li> The Space Wolves and Dark Angels have an ancestral grudge, going back to a duel fought between their respective founders ten thousand years earlier. This is nowadays <em>mostly</em> calm, and a confrontation between them is more likely to end in a series of ritualized non-lethal duels and other tests of skill than outright warfare.
</li><li> The Space Wolves seem to have a habit of forming rivalries with other chapters more so than any other, particularly if the chapter in question has a high reliance on psykers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">which always gets them riled up</a> (despite their own Rune Priests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">being psykers in all but name</a>). A perfect example would be their relationship with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">Blood Ravens</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is especially ironic if they are indeed descended of the Thousand Sons, the Traitor Legion that is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a></span>.
</li><li> The latest Codex mentions one between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Raven Guard</a> and White Scars that was patched up (somewhat) after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">members of two chapters found themselves going after the same bad guy</a>.
</li><li> The Space Wolves in particular have a major grudge against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Administratum</a> due to the policy of the Administratum to replace the entire of Armaggeddon's workforce to weed out any Chaotic corruption after the First War of Armaggeddon against Angron's World Eaters and associated daemonic hordes. They did this by forcing the entire planet's population into concentration camps to be sterilised and then worked to death via slave labour. Logan Grimnar, leader of the Space Wolves, did not like that, and told the Inquisitor as much, to his face. He could get away with his outspokenness because he had fifteen thousand royally pissed-off and unflinchingly loyal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> at his back, ready to stomp the Inquisitor into the ground. This leads to about as much friction with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Inquisition</a> as you'd expect, culminating in the Months of Shame, a war between the Space Wolves and Inquisition that did more damage to Fenris than during the whole Heresy, ending only when Bjorn teleported onto the Inquisition's flagship and killed the Grand Master of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreyKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreyKnights">Grey Knights</a> before ordering everybody to stand down.
</li></ul></li><li> The Imperial Guard and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic">Imperial Navy</a> have the typical army/navy rivalry. This one is actually deliberate: After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a>, the Imperial Army - as it was known at the time - was split into the Guard and the Navy in order to insure that no man commanded both fleets and armies.
</li><li> The Guard and the Space Marines have tense relationships at best. The Guard maintains that they are the ones who do all the real work, only for the Astartes to swoop in at the last second, deliver the death blow and take all the glory. To hear the Marines tell it; the unenhanced Guard are weak, lazy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">get in the way</a>. Depending on the chapter, an Astartes will treat a Guardsman with anything from disinterest to outright contempt.
</li><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer">Commissariat</a> and the rank-and-file Guard are not exactly friends either. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">Oops, sorry sir! indeed</a>
</li><li> Regular human forces can be roughly thought of, in increasing order of prestige as: Planetary Defence&lt;Imperial Guard&lt;Storm Troopers. Naturally, every echelon hates the echelons above and below them or treats them as incompetent (to the PDF's discredit, this is often the case, especially on worlds that aren't in a constant state of warfare).
</li><li> It's not limited to the Imperials, either. The Word Bearers and Alpha Legion Chaos Space Marines are on less than speaking terms. Exchanging bolter fire is more likely. The Legions devoted to each Chaos god also have appropriate rivalries with those who serve the god who their god particularly hates. For example, Khornate World Eaters and Slaaneshi Emperor's Children do not like each other very much. Same goes for Tzeentch's Thousand Sons and Nurgle's Death Guard. Only rarely will they co-operate in any capacity, and will fall back on killing each other once their alliance falls apart. Only Abaddon the Despoiler has much success with that.
</li><li> It's not even limited to inter-service rivalry. <em>Intra</em>-service rivalries are also common, with Guard regiments from one world going to war with Guard regiments from other worlds for a variety of reasons. The typical Ork Waaagh lasts about as long as the Warboss is able to keep the various tribes in it fighting somebody other than each other. Chaos armies are only as united as their leader is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">able to answer challenges to his authority</a>. and so on and so forth.
</li><li> Nor is it limited to intra-service rivalry — regiments from the same world and even companies within the same regiment can have poisonous rivalries. On some feral worlds, the competition over <em>who gets to enlist in the Guard in the first place</em> results in as many casualties as a small war, and Commissars of feral regiments routinely equate the enemy with their unit's hereditary enemies back home.
</li><li> And all of this doesn't even begin to go into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">tumultuous relationships</a> everyone else has with the Inquisition. Or for that matter, what happens when two Inquisitors (both of whom, in theory, answer to no-one save the Emperor and can demand instant obedience from anyone else) start butting heads. The fact that the three major Ordos have different goals (dealing with aliens, daemons, and heresy, respectively) doesn't help, as one branch may find itself under fire from the other for using alien weaponry on daemons and vice-versa. Not to mention that there are two minor Ordos whose inherent goals are diametrically opposed to each other (One dedicated to investigating and preserving the Imperium's ancient history, and the other to concealing and obscuring it), so they are always opposed to each other pretty much by definition.
</li><li> And the <em>really</em> disturbing thing is that all this interservice rivalry is in the Imperium's best interests. Every time a sizable amount of power gets concentrated in one organization, the leaders of that organization invariably let that power go to their heads, and then things get even <strong>worse</strong> than they usually are until said leaders are overthrown and their organization is broken up into smaller institutions that promptly end up in rivalries with each other and all the pre-existing services.
</li><li> Just about the only army to avert this are the Tau, to better demonstrate how their Greater Good philosophy works (where every individual's actions must benefit all Tau instead of just himself). It's implied the ruling Ethereal caste uses pheromones to mind-control other Tau into service.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>: This is perhaps the best way to describe the relations between the cults of Sigmar and Ulric. The cult of Ulric considers itself to be the "senior service", loves to point out that during his life as a human Sigmar was an Ulric-worshipper, and resents that Sigmar has supplanted Ulric as the god of choice in large swathes of the Empire. Sigmarites, on the other hand, see it as only proper that the Empire's founder is venerated above other gods by the citizens of the Empire, consider the level of devotion required by Ulric's worshippers to be disproportionate to the gifts Ulric gives (they may have a point) and considers the cult of Ulric to be sore losers. The rivalry is compounded by the fact that the Ar-Ulric only has one vote in the Imperial elections and the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar has three (technically the Grand Theogonist and the two Arch-Lectors have one each, but the Arch-Lectors always vote the way the Grand Theogonist, their superior, tells them to). Both cults are dedicated to serving the Empire and its people, but if they get the chance to get one over on the other in the process, they will take it.
</li><li> This is outright stated to be one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Scarlet Empress's</a> rules of government: divide and rule. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Realm</a> has three different types of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a> and eleven <em>families</em> of heirs.

The Bureau of Heaven wants everybody answerable to them and keeps poaching promising gods or important purviews, the Bureau of Humanity catches flak for the general heavenly contempt for mankind and is the most heavily reassigned (the boundary between a human and universal abstract is considered flexible), the Bureau of Seasons hates the interference of the others who distrust it for its importance and its military power (which it is openly willing to use to force contentious matters of policy) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">looks down on it being largely staffed by Elementals</a>, the Bureau of Nature has the largest number of gods who need new assignments (since large sections of Creation and its lifeforms were recently destroyed) and is openly contemptuous of Yu-Shan's corruption (with them in turn sneering at its naivete and inefficiency), and everybody distrusts the Bureau of Destiny (being, as it is, responsible for developing the course of the future, having a lot of sensitive information, and including Exalted in its staff) while being forced to acknowledge how necessary its proper functions are for their continued survival.

In the Machine Zones, some of the human resistance groups have been divided by internal rivalries, as well.
</li><li> In GURPS <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabeltopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabeltopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em>, there's mention of a hard-fought battle in which the US Air Force gained supremacy in space.

</li><li> Among the many company divisions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries">SLA Industries</a></em>, this trope is almost standard operating procedure.

There are two groups known as "Marines" - the Terran Marines, who are frontline combatants, and the Transit Marines, who fight to defend the transit gates and in very few other situations. The Terran Marines <em>really</em> resent that the Transit Marines, who spend most of their time outside of combat, get to call themselves "Marines".
</li><li> This is a large part of what gets in the way of operational unity during the Second Star League's attempt to bring down Clan Smoke Jaguar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. Made up of various House army units who had until then been spending bitter centuries fighting each other, they are then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">compelled to fight alongside age-old enemies in the name of overcoming much more brutal recent ones</a>. As they are all under the aegis of the reconstituted Star League Defense Force, they are technically held under one government. This gets out of hand when hardline Steiner loyalists argue about command roles with traditionally Davion supporters, Liao units distrust members of the St. Ives regiments who seceded from Liao rule, <em>any</em> Marik force argues with <em>itself</em>, and the Draconis Combine logistics arm favors Combine units above all others when they <em>should</em> be supplying gear and consumables to everyone.
<ul><li> In a more general sense, the setting breaks down its armies by their role in combat, with different divisions for Dropship and Jumpship transportation and combat units. This is further split down based on the nature of combat units: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Battlemech</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">ground armor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Aerospace wings</a>, and infantry, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">battle-armored</a> and otherwise. The most notable traditional rivalries and squabbling in most armed forces in the setting so far shown have included: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ship</a> crews and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Jumpship</a> crews, Dropship crews and Aerospace pilots, Mechwarriors and Aerospace pilots, Mechwarriors and Dropship crews, Mechwarriors and tank crews, Mechwarriors and infantry units, and Mechwarriors and other Mechwarriors.

Other highlights are how almost everyone dislikes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Security</a>, Combat's characteristic orneriness (Combat, uniquely among departments, does <em>not</em> have a departmental directive requiring them to help the rest of the Company - because when the Company was set up, Combat was the spearpoint of most missions and everyone else was support), and an aversion in the overt <em>friendship</em> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakAndDagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakAndDagger">Intelligence</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Technology</a>.

Before the Spartans came into the picture, the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers were the elites of the United Nations Space Command Defence Forces, so when the Spartans took over as the elite, the ODSTs weren't happy about it. What was more insulting to them was that, when John-117 killed two ODST troopers in a gym in his earlier ages, he wasn't punished for it (because the ODST troopers started the whole thing and John only defended himself). Ever since then, the ODSTs haven't seen the Spartans as anything more than "freaks", "cyborgs" and as "non-humans", due to the Spartans' special powers and superiority over the "normal" human beings. It ain't getting better considering the Spartans seems to have more respect from the other marines than them, even if the Spartans are actually a part of the Navy (being closer to elite SEALs than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>).

The Elites had been the dominant species of the Covenant's military since it was created. The Brutes had only been in the Covenant for some decades but had already proved themselves as the most loyal followers of the Prophets, and so believed that they would be better bodyguards and military leaders for the Prophets than the Elites. The Elites see the Brutes as nothing more than uncivilized, megalomaniacal savages, which insults them greatly. The Prophet of Truth, the leader of the Covenant, was aware of this rivalry and so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">used it to spark a civil war between them, with hopes that the Brutes would replace the Elites as the leading faction of the Covenant; the reasons being that he considered the Elite's extreme reliance on their code of honor as a hindrance on their loyalty, while the Brutes almost never questioned orders as long as it involved killing something. The other species' loyalty was splintered: the Drones and Jackals generally stayed with the Brutes, while most Hunters and some Grunts allied with the Elites. This manipulation caused the Elites to ally themselves with the Humans, and with their help, killed Truth and finished the Covenant off as a superpower</span>.

<h2> International - Present and Historical</h2>
<ul><li> An international version: The US military and UK military in WWII. Sometimes it was lighthearted ("You Yanks are overpaid, oversexed and over here." "Yeah, well you Limeys are underpaid, undersexed... and under Eisenhower!"), sometimes it was more disruptive (for example, the near-endless arguments of who should be in overall command: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Ike</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernardLawMontgomery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernardLawMontgomery">Monty</a>).
<ul><li> The argument was over who would command the ground forces, since considering the US provided most of the troops and equipment there was never any doubt Eisenhower would have supreme command. The argument was also not strictly across national lines: Eisenhower's British deputy Air Chief Marshal Tedder strongly urged firing Monty more than once.
</li><li> Interservice rivalry was the primary reason Eisenhower was retained in Supreme Command after a rocky start in North Africa: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Roosevelt</a> and US chief of staff George C. Marshall came to believe he was the only candidate with the skills necessary to keep flaming egos like Montgomery and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton">Patton</a> in line and pulling in the same direction. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Churchill</a> (who despised Montgomery) agreed with them.
</li><li> Montgomery did push it too far once, actually <em>lecturing</em> Eisenhower on what he needed to do, prompting a furious Eisenhower to coldly remind Montgomery of who was in charge. Eisenhower was so pissed off that he immediately composed a "he goes or I go" letter to <em>both</em> Churchill and Roosevelt. Montgomery got wind of it and immediately sent a fawning, ass-kissing letter to Eisenhower apologizing for his behavior, which placated Eisenhower enough to keep him from sending the letters. Montgomery spent the rest of the war very much aware of where Eisenhower drew the line and staying well back from it.
</li><li> Still happens today. In the Iraqi wars, American forces referred to the British as "the borrowers" because of the way successive governments looking for defence cuts had left the British army short of just about everything - embarrassingly large gaps in British resources had to made up by asking the US for a handout. Meanwhile the British opinion of the US Army's military abilities summed up as "all the gear but no idea" - ie, pampered amateurs.
</li><li> The U.S. introduced <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_of_the_Army_%28United_States%29#World_War_II_era">the five-star rank<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because of this (a U.S. four-star general would be outranked by a British Field Marshal). This in turn led to an additional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">six-star</a></em> rank being created for George Washington, because no American can outrank him. Ever. (No, really, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_94-479">it's the law.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li></ul></li><li> Happened during the rescue of the Burnham couple from Abu Sayyaf. Philippine Marine Intelligence had been tracking the group for a while after gaining an informant which Abu Sabaya, the group's leader, trusted. Later, their already considerable intelligence effort was boosted by American assistance. However, the Marines were never given the chance to use any of this hard won intelligence. The Philippine Army always insisted on taking over every effort to actually go in and face Abu Sayyaf because they wanted the credit for the rescue. This eventually resulted in a clusterfuck which resulted in hostage death. Philippine Marine Intelligence is still bitter about it all.
</li><li> In war games, Canada and the US.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CIAEvilFBIGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CIAEvilFBIGood">FBI and the CIA</a>.
</li><li> Before that, the FBI vs. the OSS and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService">MI6</a> allies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">The FBI and any State, County, or City police force</a>. Street cops generally don't have a very good opinion of the FBI. This is largely due to the traditional role of the FBI as investigators of police corruption.
</li><li> Tragically, this is part of the reason the 9/11 attacks were not intercepted. The CIA knew that known terrorists were on US soil (to train to fly), and accidentally told the FBI. When the FBI NY station head tried to do something about this, he was told, essentially, that he should never have been told and to delete the e-mail. That said, inter-agency battle was not the defining factor in this reason, at least not as much as federal law was - prior to 9/11, the FBI and CIA were not allowed to share information without it being declassified.
</li><li> The CIA and FBI rivalry has had the NSA enter it to create a triangle where nobody likes each other or feels inclined to share information, thus making an already bad situation worse.
</li><li> Ever since the increased militarization of police, there is a growing rivalry between the military and local law enforcement.
<ul><li> Many professional soldiers, national guardsmen and veterans have publicly criticized militarized police departments, arguing that many police officers lack the military discipline and training of actual soldiers, despite their adoption of body armor, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. Expect the comparison to also come up whenever a shoot-out occurs and the cops demonstrate poor marksmanship or follow lax rules of engagement, even ones much <em>less</em> strict than those enforced in war zones
</li><li> In the other direction, police almost universally condemn the idea of the military being used in a law enforcement capacity. Aside from being <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act">illegal in most cases<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, soldiers are trained generally in how to hurt people and break their stuff, rather than the community engagement, conflict deescalation, and investigation skills necessary for proper law enforcement.
</li></ul></li><li> Everyone in law enforcement from the Border Patrol to local police hates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Ever since its founding in 2003, ICE gained an infamous reputation for its draconian approach to illegal immigration like separating children from their parents, mistakenly deporting US citizens and imprisoning undocumented immigrants in filthy detention camps. Border Patrol view ICE as a competitor for funding while local police departments refuse to work with ICE as the agency's xenophobic image would harm police cooperation with immigrants.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Historical examples of American interbranch rivalry are numerous:
<ul><li> "The Soviets are our adversary. Our enemy is the Navy," said by Curtis LeMay, General in the United States Air Force during the Cold War.
</li><li> The newly formed USAF made an effort shortly after WWII to take control of Navy aircraft but failed. The Navy has neither forgotten nor forgiven. The Army has yet to forgive the Air Force for becoming autonomous in 1947 either.
<ul><li> The Marine Corps jealously holds on to its air wings for the same reason, having never forgotten their Navy air cover abandoning them during the initial landings on Guadalcanal.
</li><li> The A-10 Warthog has been in service for 40 years, even though they stopped building them in 1984. The Air Force doesn't care for them because they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">slow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">low-tech, and not very sexy</a>; the Army loves them because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">they're basically flying tanks</a> and are very good at dealing with anything the Army needs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">blow up</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">put dozens of holes in</a>. Part of the reason why they're still in use by the Air Force is that every time they suggest retiring them, the Army says "If you don't want them, we'll take them". At which point the Air Force refuses to retire the aircraft because they don't want the Army getting fixed-wing aircraft. The Army very much wants to reclaim the fixed-wing CAS (close air support) role from the Air Force, as they think the Air Force is uninterested in actually supporting Army troops on the ground. While the Air Force refuses to relinquish the role because they worry that it would divert funding for air operations out of their budget into the Army's, or even worse start a path to them being merged back into the Army.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46jaw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note46jaw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46jaw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The thinking being that if the Army doesn't trust the Air Force to provide CAS, they also wouldn't trust them to give fighter escorts to Army aircraft and would start demanding their own fighter squadrons for that purpose. And if the Army were to have both fighters and ground attack aircraft of their own, they might start arguing there's no point in even having an Air Force.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The antagonism between the Army (under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur">MacArthur</a>) and the Navy (under Nimitz) grew to endemic proportions during the Pacific campaign. Both had directly competing ideas of how to defeat Japan; fortunately (for the U.S., not so much for the Japanese), the U.S. was powerful enough to execute both of their ideas at the same time.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">Iranian Hostage Crisis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Army, Navy, and Air Force each wanted to take the lead on getting the hostages out of Iran, so that none of them could hog all the glory. So they came up with a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw">compromise plan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The result? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Catastrophic failure.</a> Afterward, the U.S. Special Operations Command (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">SOCOM</a>) was created out of the special operations branches of all three services. The Marine Corps followed suit... <em>eventually</em>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, there were four or <em>five</em> air forces depending on how you counted them: Tactical Air Command (USAF), Strategic Air Command (USAF), Army aviation (US Army), NAVAIR (US Navy including the Marines) and the South Vietnamese Air Force. Needless to say, planning was horrid at times since these combat commands had different chains of command. Congress actually passed a law, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater-Nichols_Act">1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that among other things removed the individual service chiefs from the chain of command and made them solely an advisory body to the President (the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and reorganized the military's entire chain of command through joint Unified Combatant Commands without regards to branches of service. This was in response to cock-ups like the hostage rescue mission and other service rivalry problems in Vietnam. As a result, while interservice rivalry is still a big thing in the US military (see below), it rarely interferes in the actual business of defending US interests.
</li></ul></li><li> Interbranch rivalry is deeply ingrained in the culture of the United States military:
<ul><li> Various branches of the military love to look down their noses at each other, and will frequently brawl should multiple branches arrive at the same bar. The Army and Marine Corps see Air Force personnel as lazy and incompetent. Air Force personnel see the Army as disposable cannon fodder and the Marine Corps as meat-headed thugs. The Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force will almost always make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor">gay sailor jokes</a> whenever the Navy is brought up. The Navy for its part will point out that they already have their own planes,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vl7h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vl7h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vl7h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Naval aviation</span> ground troops,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6s2tt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6s2tt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6s2tt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Marine Corps</span> special forces<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7xohl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7xohl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7xohl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Navy SEALs</span>, <em>and</em> nukes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8m55c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8m55c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8m55c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Submarine-launched balistic missiles</span> and so they can do everybody else's job themselves.
</li><li> Military personnel love to make mocking nicknames and acronyms for the various branches:
<ul><li> <strong>M</strong>y <strong>A</strong>ss <strong>R</strong>ides <strong>I</strong>n <strong>N</strong>avy <strong>E</strong>quipment, <strong>S</strong>ir.
</li><li> <strong>M</strong>y <strong>A</strong>ss <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>avy <strong>E</strong>quipment for a more vitriolic version.

</li><li> <strong>N</strong>eed <strong>A</strong>ny <strong>V</strong>aseline <strong>Y</strong>et is one that the other branches sometimes use against the Navy, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor">the usual homophobic undertones</a>.
</li><li> The Air Force is often called the Chair Force, since any fighting you do while sitting down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">apparently only counts if your vehicle isn't meant to fly under its own power</a>. And also because a relatively larger portion of the Air Force is dedicated to logistics rather than directly fighting, though this is quite applicable to the Navy as well. It's also teased that the Air Force is for wussies as they have less strict fitness requirements and a perception that Air Force bases are more luxurious than their Army counterparts; many USAF Personnel point out that while this may sometimes be true, it just means that Air Force enlistees are simply <em>smarter</em> for choosing this route anyway. Also note that the "Chairforce" nickname has been used within the Air Force itself... to refer to pilots of UAVs, since they fight from an office chair without ever coming within a thousand miles of the enemy, spurring a rivalry with the pilots of manned fighters who sometimes resent UAV pilots even being <em>called</em> "pilots".
</li></ul></li><li> The grudges are taught young, as evidenced by the rivalry between military-oriented youth programs. If a Navy Sea Cadet runs into a Civil Air Patrol cadet, the excrement <em>will</em> hit the fan. Slightly less vitriolic is the relationship between the Army Cadet Corps and the Civil Air Patrol, the fights of which seems to take the form of the Army Cadets saying "ha ha, we get to use guns," and the CAP cadets saying "ha ha, we get to fly airplanes." As for the Young Marines, they are roundly laughed at for wearing orange nametapes and <em>ribbons</em> on battledress.
</li><li> Within the Navy, the different branches have various low opinions of the others:
<ul><li> Submariners are called Bubbleheads and have the reputation of being extremely nerdy since the majority of them are trained in nuclear power. The thought of over a hundred men<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note936lm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note936lm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note936lm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And <em>only</em> men, as women were forbidden from becoming submariners until April 2010, and because of training time did not start joining submarine crews for a year and a half afterwards.</span> trapped in a long, rounded steel tube underwater also takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor">gay sailor</a> jokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li><li> Surface sailors in general do not have any specific negative association, but Surface Warfare Officers in particular are often viewed as overbearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>. Surface <em>ships</em> are often referred to by submariners simply as "targets" (the unspoken implication being that the sailors of those ships are mostly good for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>). "Brown-Shoes" (Navy aviators and their support staff) do, however, refer to surface officers and crew as being in the "transport" or "cargo" business, seeing their only role as getting the all-important planes where they're going.
</li><li> Surface warfare officers usually didnt have much good to say about Hyman G. Rickover, even if he was the Father of the Nuclear Navy. Senior brass often spoke of how they longed to see a destroyer named after Rickover (because destroyers are usually named for deceased Naval officers).
</li><li> The other branches think Aviators are all obsessed with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">extremely high opinions of themselves</a>, and are lazy (being the only branch with mandatory 8 hours of rest per day, while on flight duty). Of course, they would say that everyone else is just jealous.
</li></ul></li><li> Don't forget the rivalry between the Squids (Navy) and Puddle Pirates (Coast Guard). The Navy loves to put down the Coast Guard, calling them things like "toy Navy" or "shallow Navy", to which any Coastie worth his salt will respond with a joke along the lines of, "Why do Navy kids look so good? They have Coastie dads", implying that Coasties tend to sleep with Navy wives while their husbands are out to sea.
<ul><li> Oddly enough, the Marines and Coast Guard tend to get along reasonably well, in large part due to a mutual dislike of the Navy.
</li><li> Strangely enough, the Navy SeaBees <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3e95j');"><sup>definition </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3e95j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3e95j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An in-service nickname for CBs, or Construction Battalions, the Navy ground forces that, in short, build things: Throwing up buildings, running wires, pipes, water, drainage, plowing ground for landing strips, and anything in between.</span> have a little-known rivalry with the Marines dating back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. When the SeaBees were founded, they were mostly drawn from civilians with prior experience in construction, which skewed their ranks to a much higher average age than other draftees, to say nothing of the fact that, as older men with vital skills, the initial SeaBees were mostly volunteers as they'd have been far back in the drafting order. When they first conducted operations with the Marines, the Marines told them that they'd take care of them, to which the SeaBees replied no, <em>they</em> would take care of <em>them</em>. The humor in the idea of a group of sailors being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolves</a> to the <em>USMC</em> should be obvious.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Hospital corpsmen</a> are also well-respected amongst the Marines, despite technically being Navy personnel; the reasoning being that A) they undertake a role the Marines otherwise don't perform, B) they undergo much of the same training as the Marines and, other than medical supplies, carry the same kit, and C) the one people your sore ass really doesn't want to rub are medics who will be patching you up.
</li><li> The Navy even has rivalries between types of ratings (e.g., technicians vs. engineers), or even between different ratings in the same field (e.g., Electronic Technicians (Communication systems) vs. Fire Controlmen (Weapon systems)).

Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Boyd</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">suggested that the Navy might be trying to make a lightweight fighter that Congress could force on them</a>, and golly gee <em>they couldn't have <strong>that</strong></em>. To be fair, the Air Force had already been forced to eat a saltwater plane — the famous F-4. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by Boyd himself after his gambit worked:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"We don't care what the Russians are doing. We only care about what the Navy is doing."
</div><ul><li> This worked out well enough, as the result was the F-16. Ironically, the Navy then went on to adopt an enlarged version of the losing design in the Air Force's lightweight fighter competition as their own F/A-18. In part because the Navy prefers twin-engine designs, but also because no way in hell were they going to use the Air Force's choice.
</li></ul></li><li> It should be noted that much of this bickering between branches is much like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">group of siblings.</a> Sure they give each other a hard time (or in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NavySEALs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NavySEALs">SEALs</a> and Marines, get into brawls), but they would be the first to jump to any service member's defense if an outside party interfered.
</li><li> On the other hand, there are cases when rivalries went downright vicious. No less than Presidents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Truman</a> and Eisenhower, both former Army officers, tried to disband the Marines. The Marines responded by going behind their backs and lobbying members of Congress to defeat the order.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Admirals">Revolt of the Admirals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. After World War II ended, President Truman and his Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson wanted to draw down the size of the military and look for cost-savings and efficiencies. Convinced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeaceThroughSuperiorFirepower">nuclear-armed strategic bombers</a> were sufficient to defend the US against any threat, in 1949 Johnson cancelled the supercarrier USS <em>United States</em> even though construction had already begun, and tried to eliminate the Marine Corps as a seperate service branch. The Navy argued that the Air Force was overstating their capabilities and in any case, not all future conflicts could be won simply by dropping a bunch of nukes. Johnson countered by stating that the Navy was obsolete and that amphibious operations were also a relic of the past. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">Events just a year later</a> showed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantlyProvenWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantlyProvenWrong">the Navy had a valid point</a>.
</li><li> Still in the United States: Reserve and National Guard components of all branches tend to get teased by members of the Regular components since the latter serve full-time while the former are only called up for drill one weekend a month and maintain their civilian careers on the outside world (hence the nickname "Weekend Warriors"). This rivalry turned especially vicious during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> since many people volunteered for the National Guard to avoid being drafted and sent overseas (since National Guard units were almost never deployed overseas at the time, with the exception of a <em>very brief</em> deployment of Air National Guard F-102 Delta Daggers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10149n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10149n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10149n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Being highly specialized interceptors meant to shoot down Soviet heavy bombers, they weren't particularly suited for combat with other fighters and the North Vietnamese Air Force had no bombers for them to hunt.</span>). Ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGulfWar">Operation Desert Storm</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, the animosity has lightened up a bit, since Reserves and National Guard units have served on combat deployments alongside regular component units on a regular basis.
</li><li> Late US Senator (and presidential candidate) John McCain, a decorated Navy pilot, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/331884/mccain-s-last-laugh-robert-costa">was fond of saying,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "When I graduated from the Naval Academy, I tried to get into the Marine Corps, but my parents were married."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11wd11');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11wd11" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11wd11');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The punchline — as he himself notes — is that when McCain's son turned 18, <em>he</em> joined the Marines.</span>
</li><li> On Gemini 12, Buzz Aldrin held up a sign during his spacewalk that said, "Go Army, Beat Navy." His commander (Jim Lovell) was a Navy captain, so he wasn't very happy about this.
</li><li> Lovell was probably more amused when he was flying copilot on Gemini 7, as Wally Schirra on Gemini 6A (in rendezvous with Gemini 7) held up a sign that said, BEAT ARMY. Frank Borman (USAF, but a West Point graduate) on Gemini 7 was quick enough on the draw to radio, Hey, look at that sign, it says BEAT NAVY. Schirra said he had to pull his sign down and recheck to see what it read (Schirras co-pilot Tom Stafford was USAF, but an Annapolis graduate).
</li><li> There's an anecdote known as the "LA Speed Check Story", <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg73GKm7GgI">as told by Maj. Brian Shul, the man who was there<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that has him and his backseat, Walter, as a new crew on the SR-71 Blackbird on a training run across the southern United States back when general aviation had to get their ground speed from Los Angeles Center and listening in as various aircraft radioed in for a speed check and trying to one up each other on how fast they are (the SR-71, of course, has a cruising speed faster than any of them could dream of). The last one was a Navy F-18 Hornet who thought to show them all what real speed is (620 knots). Up to that point, the Blackbird crew would have probably been content to stay out of it, but, "It's the Navy! They must die, they must die now!" So they radio in and get their ground speed, 1992 knots across the ground. They cap it off by radioing back that they show closer to 2000. Point: Air Force.
<div class="indent"><strong>Maj. Shul</strong>: The king of speed lived, the Navy had been flamed and a crew had been forged.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">London Metropolitan police and City of London police</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> case. Rather than share information, each faction tried to obstruct the other—this is sometimes argued to have been a major reason why the killer was never caught.
</li><li> The Royal Air Force took control of British naval aircraft after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WWI</a>, and the Fleet Air Arm did not return to the Navy until the mid-1930s. This is frequently cited as a reason why the Fleet Air Arm's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WWII</a> homegrown aircraft were mostly junk.
<ul><li> Good example: During almost all of WWII, the Fleet Air Arm's primary torpedo bomber was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish">the Fairey Swordfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a biplane known familiarly as "The Stringbag". And despite its obsolescence, the Swordfish was one of the <em>better</em> aircraft that the Fleet Air Arm acquired during its period of RAF control.
</li></ul></li><li> In Britain there are Youth Groups linked to the military. There's the Air Cadets, Army Cadets, and Sea Cadets. The Air Cadets and the Army Cadets hate each other, but they seem to forget about this hatred when confronted with the Sea Cadets, who they join together to hate.
<ul><li> Same thing also happens in the Canadian cadet organizations.
</li><li> Don't even think about what happens when any of them encounter the Police Cadets or the Boys Brigade.
<ul><li> And all of the Cadet Forces in the UK, as well as the Boys Brigade for good measure, utterly <em>detest</em> the Scout Movement as being "for wusses".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment are more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>, at least since the Falklands War. Everybody still makes fun of the RAF, though the Army Air Corps is <em>very</em> popular since they got Apaches, and the Navy looks down its collective nose at the lot of them.
</li><li> And of course, the Scots military units hate the English military units, and they both hate the Welsh ones. But if there are Americans nearby, all bets are off as everyone teams up to beat up the Yanks. And the Scots Guards hate the regular Scots units too, for being too wimpy.
<ul><li> And of course any Highland regiment hates (in order from least to most) any <em>other</em> Highland regiment, any Lowland regiment, any Irish regiment, any Welsh Regiment, and every American unit. Of course, they will team up with less objectionable enemies to beat more hated ones.
</li><li> Despite their long and proud history of this sort of thing, the British Army ended up being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Organisation</a> in the middle of one of these during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>. MI5, MI6, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Special Branch spent so much time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">bickering over who was responsible for what</a> (bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, because domestic counter-insurgency operations were uncharted waters back then) and trying to show one another up that the quality of their work was rather lacking. Eventually, the Army resorted to forming <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_Int">a new company<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> within the Intelligence Corps to run surveillance operations in-house.
</li></ul></li><li> Particularly during the Napoleonic Wars, the British Army vs. the Royal Navy. The Navy was the more glamorous and respectable service, while the Army was the one actually fighting Napoleon in Europe but often considered a poor second by high society. This is referenced in fiction set in this time period such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a></em> and so on.
<ul><li> It has to be remembered here that the Royal Navy basically swept their enemies (French, Dutch, Spanish, Danes) off the sea at a time when the Army generally suffered ignominious defeats on the European continent, i. e. before the Peninsular War, while Army successes elsewhere in that era were depended on the Navy. And the British army simply was too small on its own, even during the Peninsular campaign it was very much dependent on the manpower provided by their Spanish and Portuguese allies as well as the King's German Legion.
</li><li> "The British Army should be a projectile to be fired by the British Navy." — Lord Grey, British Prime Minister.
</li><li> It reflects Britain's historical position as a maritime power, hence giving the Navy the lion's share. The great adversary, France, has the exact same rivalry between Navy and Army but in reverse, as befits France's continental position.
<ul><li> Britain also had a long history of distrust of armies in general, especially among the aristocracy (due to such events as Army leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s execution of the English king and establishing himself as a dictator), whereas the Navy was seen as the only reason an island nation could even survive. There's a reason it's the <em>Royal</em> Navy but the merely the <em>British</em> Army.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The British regimental system led to this since regiments were raised from different parts of the country and had distinct histories and traditions. Sometimes this led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friendship</a>, but more often to rivalry; for example, the Gordon Highlanders (raised partially from Glencoe) hated the Argylls (raised by the Campbell clan which led the Massacre of Glencoe). <br/><br/>This can go back a LONG way. In a battle in the Sikh War in 1845, a Scottish regiment broke and retreated ignominiously — right in front of the waiting Royal Welch Fusiliers, who were as verbally snarky about this as you could expect Welsh soldiers to be. The Scots then showed more fight to the Welsh than they had to the Sikhs, and an English regiment had to be interposed to maintain order. This is still a point raised in interaction between both regiments today and no love has been lost.
</li><li> British journalist and former Navy Commando Lewis Page is known, when writing about military hardware for marines, to litter his articles with the J-word and then issue a not-apology in a footnote.
<div class="indent"><em>Perhaps the fact of the author being an 11-year navy man and holder of the Royal Marines' commando qualification might allow it to be excused, under the heading of banter among fellow allied servicemen. If not, too bad.</em>
</div></li><li> The adoption of machine guns by the British Army could have been done anything up to fifty years earlier if the Infantry and the Royal Artillery had co-operated. The first machine guns used by the British had been imported American Gatling guns, used to deadly effect during the Zulu War in 1879. But as these came on artillery wheeled carriages, the Royal Artillery had insisted these were clearly artillery weapons and part of their inventory. The R.A. also insisted that any subsequent machine guns taken up by the Army be installed on cumbersome wheeled trails - even when countries like France and Germany were issuing their MGs on man-portable lighter carriages and issuing them direct to the infantry units they would support. Machine guns were only taken out of artillery control and issued direct to infantry units in the years immediately preceding WWII.
<ul><li> A similar demarcation dispute scuppered British development of self-propelled guns, vital to the experimental "blitzkrieg" strategy, in the 1920s and 1930s. The self-propelled Birch Gun (capable of keeping pace with a tank attack and providing immediate heavy support fire) was way ahead of its time for the late 1920s, but was shelved when the dispute over whether it was a tank or an artillery piece could not be resolved. Both SPG's and the lightning-war strategy they had been designed for were enthusiastically taken up by Germans who had observed the British manouevres and seen potential...
<ul><li> Germans did not escape this problem: self propelled assault guns, despite being employed like tanks, were part of artillery, not panzer. See below.
</li></ul></li><li> The Royal Artillery had seemingly learnt nothing and even as late as 1942, was still bitterly arguing that vitally needed anti-tank guns belonged to it, and not to the infantry. The British Army wastefully duplicated its anti-tank formations in a confused chain of command — some were directly issued to infantry, others were made into artillery regiments.
</li><li> Similar rivalries ended up denying the American Expeditionary Forces access to the Lewis gun when they entered World War I. While they had access to the weapon at that time, with some Marine units even being issued them before they headed over, the AEF's chief of ordnance instead forced the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">infamously-terrible Chauchat</a> because he didn't like Colonel Lewis.
</li></ul></li><li> A more specific example from British history: during the Victorian Era, the Army was largely divided into two cliques: the "Wolseley Ring" (led by Garnet Wolseley, mostly veterans of African colonial campaigns) and the "Roberts Ring" (after Frederick Lord Roberts, mostly serving in India). These two groups competed for assignments and promotions, leading to serious tension between segments of the military. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> favored Roberts, considering Wolseley a shameless self-promoter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> agreed: his poem "Bobs," a tribute to Roberts, cites as one of his virtues that Roberts "does not advertise," a veiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at Wolseley. The public however preferred Wolseley, who was lauded (and satirized) as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">the very model of a (modern major) general</a>. <br/>The rivalry finally came to a head during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar">The Second Boer War</a>. Wolseley, commander-in-chief of the Army but too old to take the field, handpicked his protégé, Redvers Buller, to command. But Buller proved an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">unmitigated failure, losing battle after battle to the Boers</a>. Buller was succeeded by Lord Roberts himself, who quickly routed the Boers (though the fighting soon devolved into guerrilla warfare). Adding insult to injury, Roberts assumed Wolseley's post at war's end.
</li><li> More WWII: RAF Bomber Command vs, at various points, Fighter Command, Coastal Command, and the US 8th Air Force. The rivalry with Coastal Command has frequently been judged as having seriously set back the war effort by starving Coastal of aircraft.
<ul><li> One of the problems being that Fighter Command got all the glory in 1940 at the expense of the other services to glamourize "The Few" (during the Battle of Britain, Bomber Command actually incurred heavier losses than Fighter Command).
</li></ul></li><li> On November 6, 1940, a Heinkel He 111 suffered a compass failure and wound up ditching off the English coast. A group of British soldiers arrested the crew and got a tow rope around the Heinkel's tail. Before they could pull the plane ashore, a Royal Navy vessel showed up. The captain insisted that salvaging the plane was clearly a Navy matter (since it was in the water). He also outranked the soldiers, so eventually they handed off the two rope. The ship began to tow the plane into deeper water, intending to then lift it on board. Instead the tow rope broke and the Heinkel sank. It was eventually salvaged, and found to contain a top secret and now-water damaged <em>X-Gerat</em> night bombing receiver. It's possible the Coventry raid wouldn't have been quite as bad had the British countermeasures team gotten the <em>X-Gerat</em> sooner.
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Russia and/or USSR - Present and Historical</h2>
<ul><li> Done deliberately by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Stalin</a> to Field Marshalls Kon(i)ev and Zhukov for the push on Berlin (Rokossovksy, despite his comparable if not greater abilities, being relegated to flank-defence along the German coast because he was both part-Polish and 'ideologically unorthodox'). He deliberately erased the boundaries between their army groups for the operation, meaning that both were free to send units into and across each other's forces. This resulted in more friendly-fire incidents than anyone cares to remember, not least because of the use of artillery and airpower. That said, at least a few of those 'incidents' were actually <em>on purpose</em> (albeit largely as payback for previous friendly-fire incidents).
</li><li> In Russia, you have the army and the navy, the army and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">VDV</a> in a not exactly bitter rivalry, and the army and the gendarmerie, the army intelligence (GRU), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">FSB, and SVR</a>, the police and FSB hating each other with a passion. And then everyone hates the Air Force because those flying bastards got it easy, while the Air Force is jealous of the Navy, as they feel that they hog up all the high-tech resources.
</li><li> A surprising aversion in the permanent branches of the armed forces of the Soviet Union (though it may no longer be true in contemporary Russia or the other CIS countries that inherited the Soviet military): the postwar organization of the Soviet armed forces was done along dual lines (unlike NATO), with the "peacetime" structure (by far more common) cutting across traditional NATO-style groupings. Entire divisions and other large groupings of specialized troops were created subordinate to a "different" force by design—for example, Soviet helicopters belonging to the army were flown by Soviet Air Force officers. While this could certainly mean for a difficult transition between peace and wartime standing, it has the consequence of avoiding the traditional friction such an arrangement is assumed to cause in a NATO army. Thanks to World War II, the supremacy of what was the "Red Army" is paramount, and ground forces generals were present in every level of academy instruction across all the armed forces. Elite units might be rivals among themselves, but interservice rivalry did not exist as you'd see famously in NATO. A closer examination of this unusual arrangement can be found from <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Banner.html?id=G3TfAAAAMAAJ">Chris Donnelly's ''Red Banner'' in chapter 8, "Running the Soviet Military Machine."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsars</a>: they had competing <em>civilian bureaucracies</em>, named Interior and Finance. "Interior" in Russia is the traditional name for the police ministry (it persists to this day), and what the Finance does is obvious. Noble families would pick a side and serve as bureaucrats for a particular ministry for generations. <br/><br/>The Tsars would sometimes favor whichever ministry was more effective, but more often would favor the underdog to keep either one from gaining too much power. Alternatively, they would set up their own bureaucracy, which would languish after their death, but never be officially disbanded. The terrible inefficiency of all this is one of the many reasons the Tsars fell.
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Germany - Present and Historical</h2>
<ul><li> Deliberately invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who kept a whole host of government and party organisations at one another's throats because he believed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> approach to bureaucracy, figuring that competition would result in more radical and effective policy-making. National Security issues, for instance, fell to the Luftwaffe, Army, Navy, SS, Order Police, and Foreign Office. It <em>did</em> produce radicalization because the threat of being sidelined led all the government agencies to radicalize themselves, and it also led to a lot of talented (and amoral) young men like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ReinhardHeydrich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ReinhardHeydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> joining the various security agencies (2/3 of their senior leaders were under 36 and the same proportion had degrees). However, the price of this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">redundancy and inefficiency.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> was when in October 1942 the Luftwaffe was authorised to create 20 infantry divisions (250,000 combat troops) for front-line use even though they had no experience with ground combat and most Army divisions were at just 2/3 strength (total strength being just 2 million combat troops of a theoretical 3 million). Hitler <em>also</em> saw it as a way to make sure nobody would be in a position to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">replace him as Fuhrer</a>; with so many bitter rivalries that he deliberately engendered, nobody other than Hitler himself could possibly have a broad enough power base to even try.
<ul><li> In the early days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>, there existed a rivalry between the SS and the SA. The SA had been very active previously, serving as the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing/street thugs, while the SS started out as Hitler's elite personal bodyguard unit. Both groups were vying for power and influence, as well as Hitler's favor, in the newly formed Third Reich. Hitler was actually somewhat afraid of the SA due to the organization's number and strength, and its tendency towards left-leaning policies more than once caused friction, not only with Hitler's own political views, which were firmly right-wing but also with the influential conservative industrialists that Hitler was trying to court in order to consolidate his power, and it certainly did not help when the SA leadership demanded for the SA to replace the regular army.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1260pc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1260pc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1260pc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was not as strange a demand as it might first seem. The regular army at the time had only 100,000 men. The SA numbered over 2 million. The SA thus saw them as just an insignificant remnant of the army that had failed Germany in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, and thought it would make perfect sense to disband the <em>Reichswehr</em> and replace it with the much larger SA.</span> And most troubling to the SS, SA's leader, Ernst Röhm, was the only leading Nazi who was on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with Hitler. This conflict came to a bloody end on June 30, 1934, when the SS falsely accused the SA of plotting to overthrow Hitler and proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">eliminate the SA leadership (and other potentially problematic persons for the Nazi regime)</a> in the Night of the Long Knives. The SA became pretty much powerless and irrelevant after that while the SS increased in prominence and authority.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">The downsides of the approach were pretty famous</a> - there were numerous instances of the various agencies slighting one another. The Navy never finished their carrier(s) because Goering was jealous, feeling that any German aircraft should come under his control, and the Navy sensibly felt that they should be in charge of their own planes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13v82j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13v82j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13v82j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It also didn't help that the Navy based their construction plans on not going to war until <em>1946</em>, but Hitler got impatient.</span> In revenge, they spiked Luftwaffe supplies and had them directed to U-Boat manufacture. Goering forced the Army to stop its advance on the BEF so that he could try to destroy the British with aircraft (the fact that the RAF might have something to say never occurred to him), and in revenge the Army never fully trusted the Air Force again, giving fuel and supplies for them relatively low priority in the supply chain.
</li></ul></li><li> Meanwhile in Germany, when General Guderian was made Inspector-General of Armour in 1943, with the remit of rationalising all aspects of AFV production and delivery to the armed forces, inter-service rivalry rewrote his terms of operation to exclude all StuG self-propelled guns — then numerically more important than conventional tanks. Thus a good two-thirds of Germany's heavy armour ended up outside his control. His task was scuppered before it began, and German AFV production remained a long way behind that of the Allies.
<ul><li> To make it full circle, he was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a> (in a way) - during prewar development of the German army, assault guns were assigned to artillery, as their main operational mission was to be direct fire support of the infantry, which was deemed too "beneath" the Panzerwaffe, which adhered to Guderian's theories how the armour ought to be massed in independent formations and conduct its own independent operations.
</li></ul></li><li> Ever since the end of World War II, there is a strong rivalry between German law enforcement and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht">Bundeswehr</a>. Whereas the police are respected by the public and politicians, the military is very unpopular and treated as a joke by the mainstream media. Further inflaming the rivalry are public relations involving their respective anti-terror units, the Federal Police's GSG-9 and the Bundeswehr's KSK. The GSG-9 is widely praised and glamorized for its accomplishments, most notably freeing all 86 hostages from a hijacked Lufthansa plane in Somalia without any losses. In contrast, the KSK garnered much notoriety for its members holding Neo-Nazi views and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_X_plot">conspiring to assassinate left-leaning politicians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Incidentally it was the Federal Police who uncovered the KSK's terror plot, which lead to its partial disbandment.
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Italia - Present and Historical</h2>
<ul><li> Italian <em>Regia Marina</em> (the Navy) versus <em>Regia Aeronautica</em> (the Air Force) during World War II. The Navy complained that the Air Force was the reason they had no carriers, that they were <em>never</em> on the battlefield in time, and that while they were very good at sinking ships, they weren't very good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe">recognizing which ships were British</a>. The Air Force complained that the Navy hoarded all the funds and technically-capable recruits, yet couldn't defeat the Royal Navy. In a magnificent example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">Fascist, but Inefficient</a>, they were <em>both</em> right due the inefficiency of the Fascist government.
<ul><li> Part of the issue was that, ironically, some of these issues arose from the higher-ups trying to <em>stop</em> the rivalry. Between the wars the government, trying to quell the rivalry between the Navy and Air Force, enforced various procedures, including a rather complex one for air support: whenever a Navy unit or squadron needed support they would have to ask for it to Supermarina (the Navy supreme command) in Rome, that would have to ask for it to Superaereo (the Air Force supreme command), that would then select the closest airport and send the planes. The planes invariably arrived late, and often attacked Italian ships because they weren't where they were supposed to be anymore and thus mistook them for enemy ships. Needless to say, the rivalry grew worse.
</li><li> Perhaps they should both blame the collective Italian military establishment for saying, essentially: "This radar fad? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It'll never catch on."</a> Cue instances of Italian cruisers being jumped by British battleships and an entire fleet being crippled in its home port by British aircraft.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Italian army there is a long-standing rivalry between the Bersaglieri and the Alpini, as the latter replaced the former as mountain troops.
<ul><li> The Carabinieri (military police and gendarmerie) are despised by the rest of the armed forces, with a contempt second only to the one reserved for the military cooks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">Cordon Bleugh Chefs</a> by Italian standards).
</li></ul></li><li> Between Italian police forces, the one between the <em>Carabinieri</em> (military police and part of the Italian Army until 2000, when they became their own branch) and the State Police and their predecessors (civilian police and never part of the Army, even if one of the corps that were amalgamated in the modern State Police was considered part of the military from 1943 to the creation of the State Police in 1981). While the officers tend to leave each other alone, the higher-ups have fought enormous ministerial-level battles for jurisdiction outside of the main cities (and the funds coming with it), with the <em>Carabinieri</em> ultimately winning.
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Other Countries - Present and Historical</h2>
<ul><li> This is surprisingly averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanucksWithChinooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanucksWithChinooks">Canada's military</a>: The Army, Navy, and Air Force are simply different elements of the same service, and thus it is rare to see a unit that doesn't contain a mix of at least two of them. Then there are what are known as "purple trades": occupations like engineer, doctor, clerk, etc that don't directly identify with an element: the difference between an Army and an Air Force engineer literally boils down to what color of beret the member likes better.
</li><li> Often develops as a result of the segregation between the various branches of a military or bureaucracy. While specializing can help these branches with their particular tasks, it also has a nasty tendency to make one branch view the other(s) as a separate entity rather than as part of the greater whole, as they have no experience or training from working with them. This tribalism can occur in large groups and small, and can have serious consequences: many times in history, units have worked or fought in the <em>presence</em> of other "friendly" units, rather than with them.
</li><li> Saddam Hussein's Iraq, after his rise to power, had the typical triangular operation — the military, the Baath Party, and the people. If one branch got too uppity, he would instigate the other two against that one.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport">People's Republic of China</a>, there is much resentment between the main army, and the navy and air force, the latter two technically under the army.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14fw1n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14fw1n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14fw1n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Somewhat unusually compared to other nations, the entire Chinese armed forces are the "People's Liberation Army". What Western nations would call the Army is the People's Liberation Army Ground Force, while the other branches are the People's Liberation Army Navy, People's Liberation Army Air Force, People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (operating the land-based ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear</a> and conventional) and People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (the youngest branch, a merger of what was formerly the other 4 services' support branches that handles electronic warfare, cyber warfare, and space launches).</span> Also, the missile and artillery forces are somewhat independent. Also, each army by military district can have intense problems with each other. So much so, the government brought in units from the countryside during the Tiananmen Square massacre, as those in the Beijing military district were considered too untrustworthy and might turn the conflict into a full-blown civil war.
</li><li> With regards to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AussiesWithArtillery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AussiesWithArtillery">Australian Defence Forces</a>, one (army) recruiter once joked that "The Army sleeps under the stars, the Navy navigate by the stars and the Air Force choose their hotels by the stars." This was met by silence as 90% of the audience was looking to join the Air Force.
<ul><li> A similar joke exists among the Royal Navy Reserve: When the Army is ordered to secure a building they blow it up. When the Marines are ordered to secure a building they storm in, kill everyone, <em>then</em> blow it up. When the Navy is ordered to secure a building they lock all the doors and windows. When the Air Force is ordered to secure a building they take out a six-month lease.
</li></ul></li><li> In pre-revolutionary Iran, as usual, the Imperial Army, Navy, and Air Force had rivalries with each other, and all disliked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">SAVAK</a>. After the Revolution, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps</a> showed up. The regular military has somewhat put aside its differences to hate on the IRGC, as although it started as a revolutionary militia, it now has its own land, naval, and air forces, as well as complete control of the Iranian long-range missile force (and thus Iran's nuclear weapons if/when it gets them), and commands the <em>Basij</em> — the regime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice">morality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">political police</a> force — as well .
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Imperial Japanese army and navy</a> experienced a destructive version of this trope. From the Meiji Restoration until the Russo-Japanese war the Army was generally considered the senior service. However, the navy won the decisive victories of the war while the army got bogged down in a meat grinder in Manchuria. So, the navy gained in prestige. After World War I and during the run-up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the intense rivalry between the was only made worse by the fact that both forces were heavily involved in politics. The military ended Japan's brief experiment with electoral democracy thanks to the way the Meiji constitution worked. The senior officers of the army and navy were actual members of the cabinet and there was no civilian cabinet member to oversee them. That meant that if a service didn't get what it wanted their officer would resign from the cabinet and bring down the government. With nobody in the government to check them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15lyfu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15lyfu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15lyfu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At first it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Emperor Meiji</a> himself who checked them. But his son Yoshihito (Emperor Taisho) and grandson Hirohito (Emperor Showa) both lacked Meiji's strong will and immense charisma, and became little more than figureheads, with Showa possibly also approving of the military takeover.</span> it got to the point that the main political factions in the Japanese government weren't political parties at all, but "Army" and "Navy". Before the war, it wasn't uncommon for army and navy officers to assassinate each other. Once the war got underway, both services established dedicated amphibious warfare branches (the army fielding its own troopships and landing craft, and the navy organizing its own infantry units), the army had their own fleet of light carriers to support army aircraft, and prioritization of steel and development money for navy ships and planes meant that the army's tanks were under-armored and completely outnumbered and outgunned by the Allies. The army, on the other hand, had complete control over infantry weapon production, so the navy (intent on maintaining those infantry divisions of its own) imported rifles from Germany and Italy as well as helping themselves (without permission) to weapons the army had captured in China.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndonesiansWithInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndonesiansWithInfantry">Indonesia</a> is no stranger to this trope, either. During the 32-year authoritarian rule of Suharto (Suharto being an army general), the army become so dominant not only in the society, but in the armed forces institution itself, and the other branches very often became sidelined. Fortunately, this got better after Suharto fell out of power.
<ul><li> Due to low discipline, some cases of inter-service rivalry even escalated to military/police units shooting at each other- police vs. military being the most frequent case. Some examples are:
<ul><li> In 1964, fully armed Army Special Forces personnel (RPKAD, now Kopassus) stormed an Indonesian Marine Corps base in Senen, Jakarta. Dozens of personnel from both sides got badly injured before the brawl could finally be suppressed by their superiors. The cause: exchanges of taunting from both sides got heated.
</li><li> In 2002, hundreds of soldiers from the 100th Airborne Troops Battalion in Binjai, North Sumatera, left their base fully armed and attacked a local police station. The police, overwhelmed, called a nearby police mobile brigade (Brigade Mobil, or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriMob">Bri Mob</a>) for help and battle ensued throughout the night. The cause: one of the soldiers from the battalion had a friend that was arrested by the police. When the soldier, with some other soldiers, tried to free his friend from the police, melee ensued. Although no one got killed, the news quickly spread to other soldiers in the base, agitating them. An attempt to calm them from their superiors came to no avail.
</li><li> In 2013, at least 90 soldiers from the 15th armed battalion in Ogan Komering Ulu district, South Sumatera, attacked and burned police officers and stations after one of their comrades got shot dead by the police.
</li><li> In 2014, the 134th infantry battalion and the Riau Island police's mobile brigade in the city of Batam exchanged fire. At least one soldier died and one civilian was injured. Some analysts concluded this accident roots from police and military rivalry in supporting/protecting illegal business in the island; the final trigger itself was taunting each other, again.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Much like Canada, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles">Israel Defense Forces</a> constitute one organization with a single Chief of Staff and various highly coordinated branches. However, in contrast to most modern countries, the Navy is if anything seen as slightly <em>less</em> prestigious than the Army, due in part to its historic origins as part of the right-wing Irgun self-defense movement (whereas the Army, grew out of the much larger, more popular Haganah) as well as a general disinterest for sea power by the military brass and government. This has resulted in a self-fulfilling prophecy, with Israel having an unusually small Navy (10,000 personnel and only three rated warships, all Corvettes) relative to its land and air power. Though <em>individually</em> each of the Navy's 3 corvettes and many of its missile boats are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">exceptionally well-armed</a> relative to their small size.
</li><li> Historically, members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades">French</a> army's 11th Parachute Brigade and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls">French Foreign Legion</a> did not get along. Those stereotypical interservice bar brawls were a very common occurrence back when they trained near each other and took weekend leave in the same town. The Legion's elite parachute regiment is technically part of the 11th Paras. One wonders if this makes the rivalry more or less intense for them. Then again, the Foreign Legion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">does think it's above everyone...</a>

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a> soon led to the Russian Civil War between moderates, socialists, anarchists and everyone who didn't want to get stomped in the process. Western powers encouraged this and armed counter-revolutionary forces. Even after the Reds won, different political factions <em>in</em> their movement and commanders from different armies immediately locked horns for dominance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">the importance of their contribution</a>.
</li><li> And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> quietly grabbed the real power, his followers and the First Horse Cavalry Army raising in his wake. And he encouraged further interservice rivalry — so that his most dangerous underlings kept each other in check. The whole Soviet system: the Communist Party (and the Supreme Soviets, the country's parliamentary bodies), the NKVD (Commissariat for Internal Affairs), and the military (including military intelligence) were all at odds with each other. The military had the big guns, the NKVD knew where all the bodies were buried (sometimes literally), and the Party determined ideological purity in the military and NKVD and thus could institute a purge if either got too uppity. If any one of the three seemed to gain too much of an upper hand, the other two could, and did, cooperate to cut it down.
</li><li> Continuing in the Cold War — with the KGB (nominally civilian intelligence and one of the committees that emerged from the breaking apart of the NKVD) and GRU (military intelligence which had its origins before the Second World War) opposing each other.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Sometimes also happens between factions of a political party.
<ul><li> One joke has a newly-elected politician taking his seat in parliament for the first time, looking across at the other party. "There they are," he says to his older colleague, "The enemy." His older colleague replies, "No, that's the opposition. The enemy are seated all around you."
<ul><li> This is related to the joke about politicians and bureaucrats popularized by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em>:

In the United States, this is called "checks and balances," and is deliberately created so that the three branches will struggle against each other for power and hopefully create a stasis.
</li><li> In the Roman Catholic Church, there are similar rivalries between religious orders. The Dominicans and the Franciscans don't get along and are united in their mutual dislike of the Jesuits. Monks may team up on generic priesthood. Unofficial coteries and official departments in the Vatican may support (or be made of) one or another faction. The failure of Catholic missionaries in Ming China has been attributed to the infighting, as the Jesuits' opponents managed to get the Pope to speak out against Jesuit attempts to accommodate Chinese customs.

</li><li> The entire field of health care (at least in the United States) can often come across like a pack of siblings who are perpetually infighting. To wit:
<ul><li> According to many nurses, most doctors are over educated, overpaid, elitist egomaniacs who often lack any kind of common sense or interpersonal skills, who don't appreciate the hard and dirty work nurses do, whose first priority is feeding their own superiority complex, and often get in the way of nurses trying to take care of patients.
</li><li> Conversely, a lot of doctors will never stop griping about nurses who think they know best despite having a fraction of the skills and knowledge that doctors do, (or at least that doctors believe they do) while missing the forest for the trees and sometimes being barely trained or competent.
</li><li> Technicians of all stripes (whether we're talking about radiologic techs who take x-rays and other images, phlebotomists who draw blood and prepare other specimens like urine and stool for testing or laboratory techs who test those samples to see what is causing a patient's symptoms) will complain about both doctors and nurses and how they either screw up trying to do functions a technician should be doing, (for example, ask any phlebotomist about the lack of skill doctors and nurses have in drawing blood and you are guaranteed to get all kinds of horror stories about the needless pain and suffering caused by doctors and nurses who never mastered the art of handling needles and drawing blood) or otherwise make a technician's job harder. Additionally, techs may often brag that doctors and nurses know nothing without the tests that the techs run and the information it provides them. Needless to say, those doctors and nurses take a <em>very</em> dim view of this attitude.
<ul><li> Just to add onto the above three categories, there are additional divisions based on field and specialties of particular healthcare workers.
</li></ul></li><li> Support staff of all kinds, (receptionists, coders, billing specialists, etc.) get blamed for all kinds of screw ups from all of the above groups, and dish out plenty of acidic comments about them as well, with the main one being that every doctor, nurse, and tech often fall into being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a>.
</li><li> One of the few things that all of them will ever agree on is that the various corporations running health care and the high ranking people like hospital board members, or people with fancy titles like Chief of Medicine are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a> who make the job harder and get in the way of proper treatment due to greed and just generally being what the military would call a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=REMF">REMF<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In large companies, conflict between the Engineering and Marketing departments is a common enough phenomenon that there have been studies dedicated to figuring out what's going on and how to keep the departments from sabotaging each other. The problem is that the two departments see the process from completely different ends; engineers ask "what can we build?" while marketers ask "what can we sell to the customers?" Accordingly, it's not uncommon for each department to try to meddle with the other, usually to the detriment of the company. You don't want engineering decisions driven by marketers who have no idea how the product will actually be built or work, but by the same token, you don't want your marketers forced to sell a technically-brilliant product that no one wants.
</li><li> In any company with multiple shifts that generally don't interact with one another professionally, it's not uncommon for them to blame each other when something doesn't work right. Examples include:
<ul><li> At Amazon's robotic-storage facilities, it's not uncommon for one shift to spot a problem, and not know how it happened. This is especially true with the amnesty crew. Problems found by a night shift AA may have been a result of something done by someone on day shift... or so the blame will likely be placed.
</li><li> Night shift nurses may blame day shift nurses for anything that happens to patients, and vice-versa. "The patient was fine when we handed them off to you, what happened?" This may apply to anything, even when it's non-life-threatening.
</li><li> Ramp workers at airports may have this now and then, due to the wild schedules some companies operate on, it's possible for two shifts to cover the same plane (one covering arrival, one covering departure), with additional shift changes possible in the baggage area between the two. If you've ever wondered how it's possible your luggage could've gotten lost... wonder no more...
</li></ul></li><li> This is a significant part of what led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> dropping out of the video game console race. Sega of Japan and Sega of America were constantly headbutting due to the fact that SoJ couldn't market the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis/Mega Drive</a> as well as SoA. This led to a number of problems, including a purposely-botched Sega CD launch, the snubbing of Sony by SoJ that led to the creation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> solely because Sony talked to SoA first, and part of the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Saturn</a> failed. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">Right Hand vs. Left Hand</a> for more of this.
</li><li> When a street gang becomes a loosely connected network of individual "sets", this is bound to happen, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers">the Crips</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips#Crip_on_Crip_rivalries">can testify<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
