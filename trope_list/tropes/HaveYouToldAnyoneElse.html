You did some poking around, and you discovered a clue that just doesn't match up with what you know about the situation at large. It's almost as if your team has stumbled upon some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>. So you decide to run this information past your trusted ally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Nialliv</a>. He listens, perhaps admits that this does indeed sound suspicious, and then casually asks: "Have you told anyone else?"
</p><p>Always answer yes, <em>especially</em> if it isn't true, and <em>especially especially</em> if your place of employment has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">High Employee Turnover Rate</a>.
</p><p>What's that phrase mean? Well, several things:
</p><ol><li> The information you've discovered is enough to at least screw up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plans if not bring him down entirely.
</li><li> Unfortunately, the first (and now, likely, the <em>only</em>) person you revealed this information to is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor">Treacherous Advisor</a> or some other variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, and possibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> himself.
</li><li> As soon as you innocently tell him that, no, he's the first person you've mentioned this to, he's likely going to make sure that information <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">dies with you</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Check your shirt color.</a> (If he's got easy access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> technology or powers, he might just mind-wipe you, though this is little better.)
</li><li> Occasionally, there is another step: Why yes, there was <em>one</em> person you told: Mr. Dead-Meat. By amazing coincidence, Mr. Dead-Meat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">accidentally shoots himself in the back of the head twice</a> the next day. You are still alive because you're too dumb to connect the dots and there's probably some part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">you need to fulfill</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">But chances are, you'll be dead anyway.</a>
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There's also the question "Does anybody know you're here?" or similar. Answering "no" means automatic death. It's rare to find someone lie and say something like, "Why yes, I told Bob, Joe, and Susan where I'd be going, who I was meeting, and what I'd be saying. And hell yeah, you can have this disc  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMadeCopies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMadeCopies">I Made Copies</a>." If they do say they told someone else, it's obvious that they just <em>now</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">realized</a> their error and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">badly lying</a> about it  Nialliv can see right through this.
</p><p>No, they proudly(!) admit that they told Nialliv first, sometimes even adding, "I'm not stupid." For the one who noticed the hole in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, they aren't too bright, are they? Reasons for telling only Nialliv tend to be something positive, like shaky proof, or information that might cause a panic/riots/mob violence targeting innocent people  maybe even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousDemotivator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousDemotivator">misplaced</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues">loyalty</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>. If only Nialliv weren't on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This moment is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> for the audience that Nialliv is playing for the other team.
</p><p>It also sometimes happens that the informant is savvy enough to take their discovery straight to the legal authorities — only to find out too late that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuysAreCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuysAreCops">the cops are in league with the bad guys</a>. If you suspect foul play, the best bet is usually to send the information to as many outlets as you can think of  even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantStopTheSignal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantStopTheSignal">if you are killed, the information will still get out</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes phrased as "Does anyone else know about this?" or "Have you discussed this with anyone else?" The key words are always "anyone else." Occasionally one gets "Have you told [specific other person] yet?", where the other person is someone with the power to do something about it — the boss, the king, the Slayer, whatever. Of course, anyone else they told could tell the specific other person, but it may be phrased this way as an opening for the doomed conversationalist to dutifully respond, "No, I haven't told anybody"

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys">20th Century Boys</a></em> detective Chou has made a startling discovery about the the leader of an enigmatic cult named 'Friend'. Turns out the leader is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a childhood classmate of our peppy main character Kenji.</span> Unfortunately he decided to discuss the matter with his assistant Yama first. Needless to say Yama turns out to be a member of said cult and "purified him." Making it even more tragic is the fact that Chou was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">just one week away from retirement</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naomi Misora</span> <em>almost</em> averts this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, but almost doesn't cut it when your opponent is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> who can kill you by writing your name on a scrap of paper. Her failure to avert the trope results from Light reminding her of L, which not so subtly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> that the two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in episode 36. The villain, after being confronted by Conan alone, asks Conan if he told anyone about this, to which Conan responds that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">didn't—and also volunteers the information that nobody knows where Conan is, either. She doesn't kill him and Conan later speculates she wanted to be caught by a child; it's not explained what Conan would have done if that guess was wrong.</span>
</li><li> Used straight a couple episodes later, in a really stupid move on Conan's part (since it almost gets him killed).
</li><li> An interesting reversal appears in movie 13, <em>The Raven Chaser</em>, where Conan asks this of Irish, the newly introduced member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Black Organization</a> who figured out Conan is actually Shinichi Kudo.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <em>Greenback Jane</em> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, Eda is holding a minor antagonist at gunpoint, apparently planning to let him go - until he suddenly blurts out, "Hey, I recognize you! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You're that woman I saw dining with a senator in Washington DC!" Eda denies this, saying she's just a nun, but "I'll tell you one thing: I'm not really from Alabama. I'm from Langley, Virginia." "You're CI—" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence">He doesn't get to finish the sentence, much less tell anyone</a>.)</span>
</li><li> In the first of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidSaga">Mermaid Saga</a></em> stories (<em>A Mermaid Never Smiles</em>) several old women ask Yuta if there's anyone in town who will miss him if he's gone. He says no, and they kill him. This is <em>somewhat</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">less dumb than is normal</a> for this trope, since it happens at the very start of the story when nothing suspicious has yet happened. Plus, who expects to get killed by little old ladies? And there's the fact that Yuta is immortal, so that might affect his "this could hurt" outlook.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast">Eden of the East</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mononobe</a> plans to lure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Takizawa Akira</a> to his side, and explains his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> to him. In a moment of extreme cunning, Takizawa had called his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> just before meeting up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and leaves his phone on so she can listen in. Mononobe thinks Takizawa can't do anything to avert his plan, and lets him go when he can't convert him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Yeah, that ends about as you'd expect</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>, Albert Maverick, the secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, asks Barnaby if anyone else was there when Barnaby learned of Jake Martinez's alibi for his parents' murder. In this case, the answer really <em>is</em> yes - Barnaby's partner Kotetsu was also present - but since Maverick <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has the ability to alter people's memories</span>, he's not really all that worried. It <em>does</em> help Barnaby in the long run, though, as Kotetsu proves to be much more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> than Maverick anticipated.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, the Prime Minster asks Chief Aramaki who else knows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the General Secretary was behind a massive blackmail case</span>, and is told that only Section Nine does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Section Nine is subsequently attacked, but only so they can go into hiding without the conspiracy knowing.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the resurrected Itachi shocked to learn of Sasuke's plans to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village after he's been told by Madara of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> behind his actions</span>, so he asks the titular character if everyone in the village knows about this. His response is that Kakashi and Yamato were there beside him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but because there is no proof of what Madara said, they will have to keep the truth quiet</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi</span> then instructed him not to tell anyone else about it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for the sake of the Uchiha clan's reputation</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: Had this happen to Roy when he tried to tell one of the top military brass about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> with the Homunculi.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindergartenCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindergartenCop">Kindergarten Cop</a></em>, the bad guy offers a reward for info on the whereabouts of his ex (who divorced him, took off with their son, and changed her name). The dupe who meets him in a back corridor of a mall tells him (of course) that no, he did not tell anyone where he was. This backfires on the villain, though, because the other man's girlfriend was actually present but hiding out of sight.

He innocently mentions it to Fat Charlie's boss and suggests that it might be rather inefficient (his life up until this point has done little to prepare him for the idea that other people might be in any way deceitful). Said boss does not ask who else knows; he merely thanks Spider, who he thinks is actually Fat Charlie, and quietly rearranges things to make it appear that it was Fat Charlie who was running the money-laundering scheme. Unfortunately, his policy of not keeping on employees for much longer than a year (the better to hide his crime) bites him in the ass; Fat Charlie has been employed there longer than anyone, but a client attempting to collect on an account knows full well that the boss has been doing this for far longer than Fat Charlie's two years.

Unfortunately for her, the detectives can honestly say that two other people involved in the investigation do know what they know, and they also quickly realize why she asked them and make it clear that trying to cover up the matter (whether by killing them or not) will have very bad consequences for her.

A couple pages later newspaper headlines reveal Qin Shang's competitor was killed in a mysterious hit and run, while Yin Tsang died of mysterious heart failure.

</li><li> Averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisEDec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisEDec">Francis E. Dec</a>. He was convinced that Gangster Government is after him because he found out the truth, so he started to send the truth out to thousands of random people, figuring that Gangster Computer God can't kill them all.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>: After spending the entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show</a></em> trying to get to his brother following a rather badly done scam, Eddy finally arrives and this bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> occurs.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vt7y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vt7y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vt7y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While at first this seems something any big brother may ask, it becomes <em>very</em> creepy a few seconds later when we find out just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">what Eddy's Brother is really like.</a> </span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Eddy's brother:</strong> Do Mom and Dad know you're here? <br/><strong>Eddy:</strong> As if. <br/><strong>Eddy's brother:</strong> Does <em>anyone</em> know you're here? <br/><strong>Eddy:</strong> Only these chumps who chased us here.
</div></li><li> Played with in the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad">Exo Squad</a></em>, Phaeton's Finance Minister asks for a secret meeting at a factory to inform him that the Martian treasury has been looted. Phaeton cheerfully admits to having diverted the funds himself in order to secretly build weapons. The Finance Minister plays along and later hacks Phaeton's files so he can expose the full extent of Phaeton's crimes. The line is only used after this attempt fails.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a>, Roddy MacStew tells the board of his company that the Pinnacle Chip is flawed and will create the Freakazoid if a certain combination of keys is pressed, followed by delete. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> running the company asks him if anyone else knows about the flaw, before throwing Roddy out the (very high off the ground) window. Lucky for Roddy, he lands in a deep snowbank and survives.
</li><li> Suprisingly subverted in the animated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn">Spawn</a></em>, where Jason Wynn delivers that line to Terry... but let him leave even though he didn't tell anyone for two reasons: Terry is loyal enough to him to actually not tell anyone for now, and because Wynn isn't 100% certain that Terry has uncovered <em>all</em> the evidence in question. May as well get it all in one place through a trusted stooge...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS5E20TheWrongJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS5E20TheWrongJedi">"The Wrong Jedi"</a>, in a rare "hero asking this question of the villain" example, Anakin Skywalker asks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barriss Offee</span>, what she said to Ahsoka the day before the latter was arrested, and if she told anyone else. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barriss</span> responds that she hasn't, Anakin replies that he believes Ahsoka is innocent, but only knows one way to find out, then ignites his lightsaber. Cue Jedi asskicking.
</li><li> In the third season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Shockwave/Longarm Prime</a> asked this of Blurr after he managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">"run" his way from Saturn to Cybertron</a>. Blurr answers yes. Needless to say, he's dead in under a minute. He puts up a better fight than most who fall to this trope, though: when Shockwave starts shooting at Blurr, Blurr uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> to avoid and escape... but he doesn't realize the corridors have been booby-trapped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashingHallwayTrapsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashingHallwayTrapsOfDoom">Smashing Hallway Traps of Doom</a> until it's too late to avoid being crushed into a small cube. <em>Still</em> worried that TFA is going to be too kiddy?
<ul><li> The real kicker? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said that Blurr was supposed to have been animated with his spark still glowing because he was still alive. A ray of hope...until Cliffjumper follows orders and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">throws him down the incinerator</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising">TRON: Uprising</a></em>. Dyson has just informed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Clu</a> that legendary hero Tron is alive and well. Clu asks, "Who else knows about this?" Dyson pauses, then kills the unfortunate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> standing next to him, and says, "Just us." This apparently satisfies Clu.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> has Red Tornado do this. He and Aqualad discuss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">a mole</a> and he utters this line. The exchange is actually understandable, but he edges Aqualad away from telling others. The same episode his visual siblings attack and nearly kill the team, and he leaves the episode by suffocating them all and fleeing with the reds. The real kick is that he ISN'T the mole, this was a red herring.
