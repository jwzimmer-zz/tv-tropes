<ul><li> Generation I:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Named</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> Magikarp, which has horrible (but not the worst) overall stats and can only learn five moves outside of events<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qpu5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1qpu5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qpu5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Splash, Tackle, Flail, Bounce, Hydro Pump  with Flail being introduced in Generation II, Bounce first becoming available to Magikarp beginning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Platinum</a></em>, and Magikarp only gaining Hydro Pump in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> via TR as a reference to an old event</span> (which was actually a paltry <em>two</em> moves at the time of its original debut appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em>), one of which does absolutely nothing, and it cannot learn anything else other than these moves. It eventually evolves into the dreaded Gyarados, which is one of the most powerful and versatile creatures in the game. Interestingly, Magikarp can evolve at level 20, which is actually much earlier than most final evolutions with comparable stats, but doing so is still a pain because the damn thing is so weak. And if you want to get a Gyarados that knows the move Flail, then you have to prevent Magikarp from evolving until level 30, or else breed a Magikarp from two members of the line who know Flail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em>, Magikarp is the weakest Pokémon in terms of potential CP and requires the most candies to evolve (400, four times the nearest competitor<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note264m5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note264m5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note264m5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">until Meltan was introduced for <em>Pokémon Let's Go</em></span>), but upon evolving into Gyarados, it becomes 15 times stronger. No other Pokémon in the game gets such a massive power boost.
</li><li> Dratini is the first start of the "pseudo-legendary" trend via the fact that it's a non-legendary with an evolutionary line that ends up giving it roughly the same stat total as any one of them (600, which is equal to the Legendaries which have 100 in every stat like Mew). It starts as a pretty unimpressive Pokémon with low overall power and a shallow level-up movepool. Compounded with an atrociously slow level-up speed and having one of the highest evolution levels of the franchise (like many "pseudo-legendary" evolution lines), it will take a lot of effort to train. Once it finally evolves into a Dragonite, it proves itself to be an impressive powerhouse with a diverse movepool.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation II:
<ul><li> Togepi starts out as a typical baby Pokémon: bad stats (aside from surprisingly good defenses) and a less-than-inspiring movepool. If you get its happiness high enough, it evolves into Togetic, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> that happens to be pretty lackluster in the early generations. But, starting in Gen IV, if you use a rare Shiny Stone on Togetic, it evolves into Togekiss, which gets a <em>major</em> boost to its stats and can learn a wide variety of moves. It gains even more utility after Gen VI with the introduction of the Fairy-Type, retyping Togekiss to Fairy/Flying.
</li><li> Zubat becomes this in Generation II. It starts out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">extremely annoying</a> to face in the wild, which makes trainers not want to bother with using one on their team. In the event you choose to do so, you start out with a rather underwhelming Pokémon that becomes slightly better at level 22, when it evolves into Golbat. Raise its Friendship stat high enough and it evolves into Crobat, who has absurdly high Speed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wprd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3wprd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wprd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">How fast? As fast as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Mewtwo</a></em>, only beaten in speed by Electrode</span> and and access to strong moves like Cross Poison and Air Slash.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4v7xp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4v7xp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4v7xp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These moves weren't around until the 4th Gen. Before that, Crobat's main use was its speed.</span>
</li><li> Larvitar is a teensy greenish mon found at level 20 in Mt. Silver, the final area of <em>Gold and Silver</em>. It's sluggish, relatively weak, and has a very mixed bag Rock/Ground type, though it learns a small handful of semi-decent moves. Its evolution, Pupitar, is somewhat better. But that's nothing when it evolves into the Godzilla-esque Tyranitar, it gets massively boosted stats via being the second pseudo-legendary (meaning its stat total is roughly around 600), trades its Ground-type off for Dark-type, and a better movepool.
</li><li> The move Return is this. It starts out rather weak, but since its power is tied to your Pokémon's Happiness stat, which increases with leveling up, winning, and even walking around, you can hit its max power of 102 eventually.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation III:
<ul><li> Shroomish, a silly-looking walking mushroom that starts with poor stats in everything but its defenses and HP. It evolves pretty early into a Breloom at Level 22, it gains a <em>gigantic</em> boost for its Attack stats, from 40 as a Shroomish to 130 as a Breloom. In addition, it becomes a Grass/Fighting-type, gaining STAB from Fighting-type moves as well as a few type resistances, and plenty of good moves. Bonus points if it delays its evolution, Shroomish will learn a move its evolution cannot have by other means: Spore, which is a move that causes the opponent to fall asleep with 100% accuracy.
</li><li> Slakoth has poor stats and its ability is Truant, which doesn't allow it to act on every second turn, but at Level 18, it evolves into a Vigoroth, which no longer has Truant and has decent overall stats... which is nothing compared to when Vigoroth evolves into Slaking, at which point it regains its Truant ability, but Slaking has one of the highest Attack stats in the game. Slaking's stat total actually matches those of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">legendary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan">Groudon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatFlood">Kyogre</a>; and unlike the other pseudo-legendaries mentioned, its stat total is instead a <em>whopping 670</em>, which is the highest of any non-legendary Pokémon in the game.
</li><li> Ralts is a Pokémon that can only use Growl, a measly early-game Attack-reducing move, and it has stats that are <em>even worse than Magikarp's.</em> It is a headache to train until it learns Confusion at level 6... but Ralts will be knocked out in one or two hits by anything that survives or out-speeds it. It evolves into Kirlia at Level 20, which isn't much better, packing stats that would be mediocre at best on an unevolved Pokémon. Though it doesn't take too long before Kirlia evolves into a Gardevoir at level 30, a major improvement over Kirlia. Gardevoir's Special Defense is incredible, and access to recovery moves and Calm Mind makes it nearly impossible to kill without physical damage. Calm Mind also boosts its Special Attack, meaning that it will win most fights with one attack after a couple of boosts. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Spear Counterpart</a>, Gallade, is no slouch either, but with more of an emphasis on his Attack and a sufficient movepool of his own.
</li><li> Magikarp's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">third generation</a> equivalent, Feebas, is a similar (if not <em>quite</em> as useless) case; it evolves into the defensive-based and beautiful Milotic. Thats it, if you know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">how to find it and evolve it in the Generation III and IV games</a>. Though starting in Generation V, an item named the Prism Scale is introduced, which bypasses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> and allows Feebas to evolve on a trade if it's holding one.
</li><li> Beldum can attest to Level 20's awesomeness as yet another pseudo-legendary, as it goes from a ridiculously hard-to-catch floating leg that can only learn Take Down, a move that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">deals recoil damage</a>, to Metang, which becomes the defensive and powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Metagross</a> at level 45.
</li><li> Trapinch has lousy stats all around except for a beastly 100 attack (almost half of its total stat points) and doesn't evolve until Level 35, where it becomes the mediocre Vibrava (which has <em>less Attack</em> than Trapinch, albeit with improvements to the other stats, especially Speed). Stick with it until level 45 and it becomes the awesome Flygon, with good all-around stats (regaining Trapinch's Attack and further improving on Vibrava's Speed, along with being decent at everything else), which has a good movepool and an (at the time) unique typing in Ground/Dragon.
</li><li> The second pseudo-legendary line of Pokémon within the generation is Bagon's line, who has a slightly decent movepool but still some lackluster stats. Shelgon is its next form at level 30, then Salamence at Level 50. Even its Pokédex entries state that via Bagon's long-lasting desire of wanting to fly, it expresses massive joy upon finally evolving into a Salamence; it seems hard work pays off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation IV:
<ul><li> The Gible line is the resident pseudo-legend of the generation, and fits a similar mold to its predecessors. Gible is a weak Pokémon that can only be found in a well-hidden, out-of-the-way cave filled with boulder-pushing puzzles and Bike-reliant obstacle gauntlets. At level 24, it evolves into Gabite, which is an improvement, but still nothing special. Then it evolves again at level 48 and becomes Garchomp, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with a dramatically expanded movepool.
</li><li> Combee might not bring much to the table, being a Bug/Flying-Type with utterly pathetic stats and only three moves to its name, Gust, Sweet Scent, and Bug Bite. Gen V does give it Bug Buzz, but Gen VIII swaps it out for Struggle Bug. However, if you're lucky enough to catch a female Combee<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5xfor');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5xfor" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5xfor');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> There's a 7:1 gender ratio skewed towards males</span>, then you have yourself Vespiquen, a Pokémon with the best defensive stats among Bug/Flying-Types. Not only that, but its movepool gains a <em>massive</em> boost, including a move that can make its already impressive defensive stats even more impressive.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation V:
<ul><li> Tynamo is a cute Electric-type eel with no type weakness thanks to its Levitate ability, and thats it. Its stats are unimpressive and it can only learn four moves until it evolves at Level 39. Additionally, it takes more experience per level-up than most Pokémon at the same level as it, making it a great pain to raise to level 39. But as soon as it evolves into an Eelektrik, the player can use a Thunder Stone on it to evolve into Eelektross, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with a wide variety of moves to choose from on top of the aforementioned lack of typing weaknesses.
</li><li> Litwick, a Ghost/Fire-type from Generation V, has terrible stats and doesn't evolve until level 41. However, as soon as it does, it can be evolved again into Chandelure, which has the second-highest Special Attack of any non-Mega, non-legendary, <em>less than 10 points shy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Mewtwo</a></em>.
</li><li> Larvesta begins with average or poor stats in everything except Attack, which goes to waste when you see that its evolution, Volcarona, has massive Special Attack instead. It doesn't even evolve until Level <strong>59</strong>, but if you do, it gets a mountain of Special stats, Speed, and Quiver Dance, which boosts all three of those stats.
</li><li> Out of the pseudo-legendaries, Deino is particularly notable because it evolves much later than the rest  it evolves at 50 (you can get Salamence, Metagross, and Garchomp, other pseudo-legendaries, by this level, while Dragonite and Tyranitar are Level 55 instead) and then <em>level 64</em>, the highest evolution level of anything in the <em>entire series</em>. What's more, Deino and its evolved form Zweilous have an ability that <em>lowers accuracy</em>, making them pretty unreliable to use. Once it evolves into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Hydreigon</a>, it trades its Hustle ability for a far more reliable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFloats">Levitate</a>, and it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> capable of learning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">tons of moves</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation VI:
<ul><li> Gen VI's pseudo-legendary Goomys stats are underwhelming at this point of the game, and its movepool is rather shallow. Even the Pokédex says it's the weakest Dragon-type ever<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6dfnn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6dfnn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6dfnn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though Noibat is actually weaker</span>. If you stick with it, however, it eventually evolves into Goodra, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> that has a staggering Special Defense stat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">is the most adorable dragon ever</a>.
</li><li> Noibat is pretty much a special-attacking version of Zubat, while its evolution, Noivern, is a slightly slower, slightly harder-hitting special version of Crobat. However, Noibat won't evolve until level <em>48</em>, and its natural movepool is nothing to write home about. However, once it evolves, it becomes the fastest Dragon-type in the game, with their typical movepool.
</li><li> Skrelp's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Poison</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Water</a> typing is relatively underwhelming, it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">balanced but mediocre stats</a>, a shallow movepool, and it evolves at level <em>48</em>. But when it does, it becomes the fearsome Dragalge and ditches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Water type</a> for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragon type</a> (it keeps the Poison type, meaning that it takes neutral damage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Fairy attacks</a>, unlike other Dragons), and it gains much-needed bulk and attack power.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation VII:
<ul><li> Wishiwashi is a Water-type that gains vast improvements at Level 20 just like Magikarp, though through an Ability rather than evolution: At Level 20 or above, this sad-looking fish schools together into one conglomerate, which vastly improves its stats (except for Speed, which is slightly lowered). It is a more extreme jump than Magikarp, with its Solo Form being weaker than Magikarp (stats-wise, it has the lowest overall stats) and its School Form being stronger than some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. However, it gets the drawback in which if its HP falls to 1/4 or below, it will revert back to its Solo Form. It can return back to School Form if its HP rises back above that point, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Wimpod</a> has extremely low stats other than its speed, a shallow movepool, and an ability named Wimp Out, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowerPower">makes it switch out when below half health</a>. Raise it up to level 30, and it evolves into Golisopod, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with a wide movepool. While Golisopod has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Emergency Exit</a>, which functions exactly like Wimp Out, it can take advantage of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a>, First Impression: a powerful move that has priority, but can only be used on the first turn its switched in.
</li><li> Bounsweet starts out as a pitiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> whose Pokédex entry states that she is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwallowedWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwallowedWhole">Swallowed Whole</a> by other Pokémon. She evolves into Steenee at level 18, and while Steenee is an improvement over Bounsweet, her overall stats are still terrible. And after learning the move Stomp at level 29, she can evolve into Tsareena, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with a high Attack stat and nice bulk.
</li><li> From the defensive side of things, there's the Mareanie line. As a Mareanie, its overall stats are pretty underwhelming, especially for a Pokémon that can only be encountered if a rare Corsola tries to call for help. But once it evolves into Toxapex, it receives a huge boost in both its Defense and Special Defense stats (which become a beastly 152 and 142, respectively), turning it into a formidable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> with the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">heal itself</a>.
</li><li> Salandit is a somewhat weak Pokémon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> with more glass than cannon (it can easily be one-shot by neutral effective moves), and only females can evolve and females are somewhat rare (7:1 ratio). Stick with it through its rather rough training period with its low defense, and it evolves into a Salazzle. While her bulk is still terrible, her Special Attack is amazing and shes dangerously fast.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cosmog</span> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">case to end all cases</a>. Statistically, it's a Psychic-type Magikarp with even lower speed, and can only learn Splash and Teleport, neither of which damage the enemy or even have any practical use whatsoever. Once you get it to level 43, it evolves into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cosmoem</span>... which, while it has improved defenses, is still weak, and still knows no damaging moves. Until it evolves a second time, pretty much the only way it can win a battle without help from another Pokémon is to make it run out of PP so it can use Struggle. You have to baby it up for 10 more levels, but once it reaches level 53, it evolves into either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Solgaleo</span> or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lunala</span>, depending on the version. For a stat-wise comparison, it starts off as Magikarp without any attacking capabilities whatsoever, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes something akin to Beedrill (but still not able to attack) upon evolving into Cosmoem, and then finally evolves into <em>Mewtwo</em></span>.
</li><li> Meltan, Gen 7's very last Mythical Pokémon, is very weak stat-wise, but is unique because it can evolve... However, it can only evolve in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO">Pokémon GO</a></em>, and surprise, it needs <em>400</em> Meltan candies to evolve. What makes it worse is that they only appear when you've activated a box <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummoningArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummoningArtifact">summons them for you to catch</a>, and it only works for 30 minutes until it closes and can't be opened again for <em>a whole week</em>. This makes the process of obtaining enough candies to be very arduous. Once you do, you'll be awarded with a pure Steel-type Melmetal who has stats on par with Mew.
</li></ul></li><li> Generation VIII:
<ul><li> Toxel is a baby lizard that you receive at level 1 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, and it has low stats and a very limited moveset (its strongest move is Belch, which it can only use after eating a held berry during battle, and otherwise it's stuck with the likes of Nuzzle and Acid). Raising it to level 30 lets it evolve into Toxtricity, a much stronger Pokémon with more moves to take advantage of its Electric/Poison typing and eventually the super-powerful Boomburst (further boosted by its Punk Rock ability), and it comes in either the Amped or Low-Key forms depending on its nature. The Wild Area can spawn Toxels that are much closer to level 30, making it easier to evolve them.
</li><li> Blipbug is an early-game bug with hideously bad stats (its base stat total is exactly the same as Sunkern's, who held the record for lowest BST until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>) and a whopping one move. It evolves fairly quickly into its second form Dottler, which has tolerable defenses and three more moves, but still suffers from the typical pupal Bug Pokémon's problem of not learning any more until it evolves again (although the moves it does get are at least better than the usual combination of Harden and String Shot) and still does basically no damage. Lug it around for 20 more levels, and it becomes the considerably more powerful Orbeetle, which can immediately re-learn Bug Buzz and finally start smacking things around and also boasts a fairly expansive support movepool.
</li><li> Applin is just as strong as you'd expect a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">wyrm living inside of an apple</a> to be, and it doesn't evolve by level, leaving it as a dead weight in the party for a while. It gets stronger when evolved using one of two rare version-exclusive apples: <em>Sword</em>'s Tart Apple turns it into the fast Flapple, and <em>Shield</em>'s Sweet Apple turns it into the bulky Appletun.
</li><li> Snom is a small jewel caterpillar with extremely weak stats overall (third-weakest in the game) and has a very limited moveset, learning only Powder Snow and Struggle Bug naturally. It only evolves with maxed friendship at night, becoming the special-attacking Frosmoth which has far better stats, and can take a good few attacks on the special side if it has the line's unique ability Ice Scales.
</li><li> Dreepy is a 2% hidden encounter in foggy weather, has pathetic stats, with none of its defenses going above 45, and only learns Quick Attack, Bite, Infestation and Astonish. Stick with it until level 60, however, and you get Dragapult, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> who has a diverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">mixed attacker moveset</a> with the Speed to use it.
</li><li> Galarian Farfetch'd is pretty much just that: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">a Farfetch'd.</a> However, land 3 crits in one battle, and it evolves into the slow and bulky Sirfetch'd, who has a much better movepool and gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> of its very own in Meteor Assault. That said, Farfetch'd is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> - while the normal Farfetch'd is incredibly weak for a fully-evolved Pokémon, as a not full-evolved Pokémon Farfetch'd has rather decent stats and movepool - considerably better than the other Pokémon listed here, at least.
</li><li> Milcery's stats are pretty much the same across the board, and what you'd probably expect from a sentient blob of cream: pretty freakin' bad, with only her Special Defense being any form of notable, and she only learns <em>TWO</em> offensive moves whatsoever by level-up, with only a few more by Technical Record. However, if you're lucky enough to get a Sweet from the Battle Café, or if you caught her in a Max Raid Battle, give her the Sweet and a spin and she evolves into Alcremie, a slow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember">Support Party Member</a> who can use Acid Armor and Recover to increase her survivability, has a commendable special TR movepool, and can power up her allies using Decorate. Oh, and if you caught her in a Max Raid Battle at a certain point, she can now <em>Gigantimax</em>.
</li><li> Rookidee, being an early-game bird, has the sort of piddling stats you'd expect from one. Not only that, but it can only learn three damaging moves naturally before evolving, Peck, Fury Attack, and Pluck, one of which it can't gain STAB from since it's just Flying-Type and not Normal/Flying like the other early-game birds. When it does evolve, it becomes Corvisquire, which does have better stats than Rookidee, but it's still rather limited in terms of which moves it can learn, both by level-up and by TM/TR. When it evolves into Corviknight, however, it becomes a Flying/Steel-Type airborn tank with better and more balanced stats than Skarmory and a more commendable TM/TR movepool. It can even learn Steel Wing and Iron Defense to further boost its already impressive physical Defense.

In both the game and the series, the unit is technically a flawed and defective piece of junk, despite having a stupid powerful beam cannon that would make Wing Gundam cry. However, after some minor upgrades and using the unit for a little while, the player can upgrade it into its true form: the L-Gaim Mk. II, the most ridiculously powerful unit that the good guys get in the L-Gaim series, and a very good power unit in ACE 2.
</li><li> It's easy to mistake the Luna Lens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> as exclusively being for flipping switches, as it has unlimited ammo but doesn't damage or stun enemies. Thing is, if you manage to get the lens up to Level 3 by killing enemies via stage hazards, it gains the ability to stun. Given the game's emphasis on stunning and sneaking by, it suddenly becomes the single most useful lens in your arsenal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django</a></em> has the bare-handed punch which, in all likelihood you will use for the 14 second span between losing your gun and finding the Gradius sword and never use again. What a lot of people don't realise is that there is <em>no</em> recovery time for the attack; you can damage enemies as quickly as you can mash the B button. If you devote the time to level it up to 99 <em>and</em> raise Django's attack stat sufficiently, it becomes the <em>single most devastating attack in your arsenal</em> despite its low range and non-elemental damage.

<ul><li> The game starts you off with a gimped version of the legendary Vampire Killer whip, and it is the weakest whip in the game. However, if you defeat its "memory" (AKA <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Richter Belmont</span>) in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> battle, you unlock its true power and turn it into the most powerful whip in the game.
</li><li> The game also features two gag sub-weapons: the pie and paper airplane. They're functionally useless until you level them up to max level, when they suddenly become some of the most powerful subweapons in the game. Interestingly, these are particularly useful in unlocking the full potential of the Vampire Killer, since they're two of the very few weapons Jonathan can use that deal dark damage, which the whip's memory is weak to.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuramasaAndMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuramasaAndMasamune">Muramasa</a>. A middling two-handed weapon whose obvious benefit is that it provides an automatic heal whenever an enemy bleeds on Alucard. Less obviously, the sword actually grows in power over time as it absorbs blood... the only limit to its power is the calculation algorithm of the game. However, in the time of actual gameplay, it's far easier to acquire a number of other game breaking weapons before leveling Muramasa to the point of it being of any real value. Players who do manage to power up Muramasa tend to just take advantage of a turbo controller in a specific location while leaving the game running over night.
</li><li> The Sword Familiar. At first his method of attack is to slowly lock onto an enemy, slowly fly to whatever spot they were at (even if they moved), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">wait</a>, and lazily spin in a circle that does weak contact damage. However level him up to 50 and he becomes an equippable weapon identical to the Alucard Sword but with an attack equal to his current level, and level him up to 70 and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">glows blue</a> and starts swiftly flying all over the place slashing hoards of enemies that only get faster and stronger as his level climbs. Get him to level 99 and you can pick between the strongest nominal sword in the game or a ridiculously powerful ally.
</li><li> The Ghost Familiar attacks by clinging to an enemy and repeatedly delivering weak damage, and he'll get slightly more aggressive with each level. This isn't too useful until he reaches level 70 and suddenly each hit restores 8 HP to Alucard. At level 99 this adds up to about 8 free HP <em>per second</em> during boss fights and when battling strong enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>:
<ul><li> Refuse to trade away your wimpy initial weapon until the near-end of the game, and you'll be able to upgrade it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">the almighty Spur</a>. This is partially a reward for honesty, since said wimpy initial weapon technically doesn't belong to you, and you get the upgrade by returning it to its rightful owner.
</li><li> The Bubbline/Bubbler is another example. At level 1, it's similar to the above-mentioned wimpy initial weapon, but slightly <em>less</em> useful. At Level 2, it makes a decent substitute for the Machine Gun — a weapon you can't get if you're going for the Spur. At level 3, it fires a cloud of bubbles as long as you hold down the fire button, which start popping rapidly and firing lightning bolts once you've built up enough... and once you release the fire button, they all pop and fire their lightning bolts at once. This is roughly as potent and deadly as it sounds.
</li><li> The Nemesis is actually an inversion; it starts off as possibly the strongest weapon in the game, but as it levels up, it gets progressively weaker to the point that at the maximum level, it shoots <em>rubber ducks</em>. Did we mention this thing levels up <em>insanely fast</em>?

Once you throw $450,000 at the right black market merchant to upgrade it to the level 3 "Street Sweeper", it goes up to ten rounds a clip and 100 rounds to spare with an automatic action, compared to the Magnum's level 3 "Python" with 8-80 and semiauto. Unless you are feeling the need to be stylish or are somehow running low, the shotgun is now the way to go.

It can be dropped by an early-game enemy, but its attack power is much lower than the other weapons you can get for her at that point. Level it up enough and it gains Attack +100, Normal Attacks +40% (basic physical combos get a major boost to attack power), and Generate Attack Wave (which shoots energy waves with every attack made with the weapon, thus increasing its range). Jubei will then be able to shred through nearly everything you come across and continues to be useful even in the second disc.

</li><li> Several cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalCardGame">Eternal Card Game</a></em> start out weak, but power up through various means.

For example, the Questing Adventurer gains 1 attack and 1 HP every time the player plays a card, while the Frothing Berserker gains 1 attack when any minion takes any damage. With a good deck and good luck, they can win the match on the next turn - if they manage to survive past their first turn.

Susanoo starts each round with seven of his eight special moves <em>locked and completely unusable</em>, and the player must unlock them with his Drive attacks. Additionally, some of his specials can be powered up even further if you "unlock" them when they're already unlocked.
</li><li> The bow and arrow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers">Castle Crashers</a></em>. Initially, the weapon fires arrows at an angle and at a very slow speed. Increase your character's Agility stat, however, and the angle lessens until it fires straight ahead and arrow speed shoots up considerably. With a high enough Agility, you can even juggle enemies with the bow!
</li><li> In the arcade game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsShadowOverMystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsShadowOverMystara">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara</a></em>:
<ul><li> A player may find the Cursed Sword. As the name suggests, it's cursed; every time the player tries to swing it, it damages the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>. However, if the sword is swung often enough, it becomes the most powerful weapon in the game, outmatched only by weapons that are specifically designed to kill certain types of enemies.
<ul><li> There's also the <em>other</em> Cursed Sword, which randomly can't be swung and isn't very powerful. Pick it up 8 times with a cleric, and it becomes the Holy Avenger, the second most powerful weapon in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> If you time it correctly, you can interrupt the "knock-back" animation (and the damage!) from the curse by either jumping and swinging right before landing, or having someone else cast a targeted spell (like Cure Light Wounds, or Striking) on the Sword swinger. Cursed Sword 2 is much easier; have the Cleric (try to) pick it up enough times.
</li></ul></li><li> Pucci's moveset in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle</a></em> is based entirely on this. He first starts the match with his stand Whitesnake, which is rather versatile but underpowered. By speaking all 14 of Dio's secret words to Green Baby, his stand permanently transforms into C-Moon and gives him several new moves, including his GHA which allows him to further evolve his stand into Made in Heaven, which causes the enemy's speed to be to be lessened <em>for the rest of the match</em>. Johnny also fits to a lesser extent, since he gains more moves the further Tusk evolves throughout the match.

He starts with poor mobility, weak normal attacks, and a lack of moves in general. Collect evidence and put him in Trial Mode, however, and he gains access to a variety of projectile attacks and much better moves. And if you can get him in Turnabout Mode, he becomes one of the strongest characters in the game, doing immense damage with all of his attacks, having invincibility with some of his moves, and gaining access to one of the best level 3 Hyper Combos in the game - which is <em>the</em> single strongest attack in the game, no less. In other words, you start the match with a huge disadvantage and have to slowly gather evidence while playing keep-away until you can trigger a turnabout.

In each battle, he'll copy a random move from each participant, but he still needs Skill Points to equip them — and at the beginning of the game, you'll have <em>very</em> few, forcing you to make such decisions as "do I want Emerl to be able to walk or do I want to give him the second hit in his combo?"

<ul><li> In the sixth game, the bow moveset shared by Sun Shangxiang and Yue Ying initially seemed dismaying - "They took two of the coolest women in the game and gave them a useless weapon!" However, once you level up that bow and arrow, it's a <em>monster</em> because you can spray tons of arrows into the crowd at once. It's also a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in that you can snipe from a faraway enough distance that the computer AI generals don't realize they should block your attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline">Dynasty Warriors Online</a></em>, it's actually part of the mechanics. No weapon ever starts out at full power in the first place. You have to temper weapons so they have better stats. This trope comes in, however, in that tempering only has a limited effect on the stats based on the weapon. If you grind a weapon, you have to use it so many times, you can change the stat spread on a weapon. On some weapons this is needless. On others, like the tonfa, this turns what is otherwise a horribly stated weapon into a competent one, with good combos as well.
</li><li> Speaking of Dynasty Warriors, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors">Fire Emblem Warriors</a></em> has special character-specific weapons that are pure garbage at first. They have abysmal attack power barely breaking 80 and most averaging 30 which is good until about halfway through the campaign on <em>normal</em>, but the latest updates the game released created "opus" materials which specifically power up certain weapons for certain characters, and change that worthless 30 damage stick into a 700+ damage god-killer. Even the hero weapons rarely boast such power. Coupled with the fact that you'll usually be breaking levels over one hundred at this point, you can practically ignore the weapon triangle and just beat everything to death in seconds.

Initially they start with low attack power (usually 9 or 10), but at max proficiency they gain a plus 54 attack increase, making them the most powerful weapons in the game, except for a select few 4-star weapons reserved for extremely badass characters.

He starts out incredibly weak, with a short-ranged attack that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a> and not a lot of health. Thing is, instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a>, he gets upgrades each time he beats a stage. This includes a far more damaging sword attack that cancels projectiles, increased range on all his attacks, godlike air mobility (including a double-jump, a flying uppercut, an airdash, a ground-pound, <em>and</em> a Rush-style hoverboard), a big speed boost, an attack that generates seeking projectiles that damage enemies, pick up items, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenialOfDiagonalAttack">can move in any direction</a> every time he dashes, and the ability to deflect shots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">just by standing still.</a> And remember: unlike Mega Man, he gets all these abilities at the same time. By the Wily Castle stages, he's turned the game's notoriously steep difficulty curve into a pretzel.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> series since the introduction of upgrades, many of the weapons will be crap to start with, but after an upgrade or two, will become massively awesome. Notable examples:
<ul><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em>, the Shield Charger. It surrounds you with shield that negates all damage and slightly damages enemies that touch it, but it has kinda low ammunition that cannot be found in crates and does not stay on that long. Upgrade it - which is very hard to do - and it becomes Tesla Barrier, that shocks nearby enemies with surprisingly powerful shocks, takes much more punishment, and gets more ammo.
</li><li> Plasma Coil from the same game is basically a plasmatic rocket-launcher that damages a single enemy and zaps everyone nearby. Cool, but not as powerful as you would expect from a weapon that costs 150000 bolts (more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Bouncer</a> that is available two planets prior). 15 shots only don't help at all. Upgrade it and it becomes Plasma Storm that shoots a ball of plasma that shocks all enemies it travels by, possibly multiple times, and can clean a room by itself.
</li><li> Also from second installment, we have Gravity Bomb/Mini-Nuke. It is your starting weapon and upgrade makes nice mushroom cloud, but that's it, and will probably fall by the wayside for the rest of the game. Until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, that's it, where its upgrade to mega version costs as much as Zodiac and more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">R.Y.N.O II</a>, but its ammunition goes from 8 to 20 (and 30 for Ultra version), while the damage becomes on par with said weapons and is ramped further when upgraded to Ultra.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em>, the Holo-Shield Glove. V1: blocks a few projectiles before it shorts out, and serves no secondary purpose. In a word: useless. V2: blocks more damage, and sucks the very lifeforce from your enemies to heal you. In a word: awesome. It then begins to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter-Attack</a> enemies, and shields become bigger.
</li><li> From the same game, the Infector. It's a complete bitch to upgrade, the hardest in the game and only ever has 15 ammo, 20 or so max. V1, shoots out a ball of goo that does small damage, V2 makes the infection last a bit longer by a few seconds, V3 has splash damage, V4 has slightly better splash damage and homing, and V5? Launches out a massive Infecto-Bomb, hence its name, that infects the blast radius and anything the resultant 6-8 globs of goo seek out and find, with phenominally better performance.
</li><li> The same game has also Disc Blade Gun, which is pathetically weak by the time and for the price tag you get it. V2 does not help it much with saws reflecting from walls, but not enemies and slightly higher damage. <em>Then</em> at V3 its damage more than doubles, and discs starts to bounce of enemies as well, allowing it to hit many enemies with a single disc (especially with their latent homing abilities). The final upgrade causes disc to split each time they hit an enemy up to 16 discs, making it an effective crowd-controller.

Even in <em>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</em>, collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds <em>still</em> doesn't grant Tails any cool new powers, unlike Sonic or Knuckles... however, by playing through seven more Special Stages, the Chaos Emeralds can be upgraded into the more powerful Super Emeralds, which grant a fancy new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> to anyone who collects them, <em>including</em> Tails. And unlike the other transformations in the game, Super Tails comes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">four birds</a> that home in on enemies and deal damage to them — all Tails has to do is just stand and burn rings for energy while the birds fight for him. The game also largely averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a>: the birds can damage almost any boss in the game, with the only exceptions resulting from the unusual strategies those bosses require.

</li><li> Sonic in <em>Sonic 3</em> without Lock-On. His special abilities aren't nearly as useful as Tails' flying, but unlike Tails, he can transform into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> after you collect all Chaos Emeralds, which makes him invulnerable and faster and improves his jumping height.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>, the Mystic Melody power-up. On your first playthrough it will seem useless, and no characters can get it unless they backtrack to find it (for some it's easy, for others you can't get it until the <em>last level</em>). Then, when you finally HAVE Mystic Melody, you can use the power with small temples which are just barely hidden in the game's stages. The Melody can do everything from open portals to cause rings to magically appear, which you can use as shortcuts to later parts of a stage or pathways to other powerups... basically, it's practically an in-game cheat item, and is also required for certain special missions.

</li><li> The <em>Afterbirth+</em> expansion for <em>Rebirth</em> includes a new active item called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">"The Void"</a>. While it initially doesn't do much on its own, it can "consume" any pedestal item(s) in a room and either provide a random stat boost if it's a passive item or permanently gain its effect if it's an active item (with some exceptions such as single use active items), as a result, the Void gets continually more powerful the more active items it consumes while the user gets more powerful the more passive items it consumes. Depending on what items it absorbs, the Void can easily become the single most powerful active item in the game.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">The Magikarp Power of the Void</a> is demonstrated nicely through the <em>Afterbirth+</em> unlockable character Apollyon: a subpar (stat wise) clone of Isaac who starts the game with the Void, before breaking it with good charge management and some luck.

<ul><li> Wrestler dwarves. In general, a raw recruit tends to last a bit longer if they have a weapon to parry the occasional attack. Once they can consistently dodge or block attacks, and have adequate armor, they can easily cripple most enemies with their bare hands. Depending on the version, they can either render the enemy helpless against better-armed comrades, or do all the work themselves tearing enemies to bits.

And most other swimming creatures with any decent natural attacks. This came about by accident due to the game's skill- and stat-raising mechanic: skill levels increased by the act of performing the skill, and increasing a skill readily affected the relevant stats. Creatures like carp gained extremely high stats due to constantly training the Swimming skill, which translated into their becoming infamously lethal.

<ul><li> The Carnelian (Crystal Type B) suffers from this. You start out with no weapons, no drones, a three-Crystal crew, and a four-man teleport. Getting through the first sector or two requires more than a little bit of luck, since you have no way of destroying Rebel drones unless you sacrifice a crewmember, which is a spectacularly dumb thing to do. However, if you can keep it flying long enough to get some more crew and some backup weapons to shore up your offense, then it's far and away one of the most powerful ships in the game.
</li><li> The Basilisk (Mantis Type B) also suffers from this, but not as badly as the Carnelian. You start out with two Mantises, two layers of shields, and a Defense Drone and Boarding Drone. While you're better equipped to shrug off enemy attacks, you have to leave your ship on autopilot while you send your Mantises over to fight. Also, Mantises naturally have horribly slow repairing speeds, meaning it's nigh-impossible to get a system running again in the thick of combat. Again, though, if you can get some additional crewmembers (preferably Engi to shore up your repair capacities) and some backup weapons, then you've got a powerhouse.

Useless during the early game when the player is still learning the ropes and doesn't know what each new level contains, but a skilled player basing their entire run around it can end up with 20-30%+ bonus damage by the end of a run and it comboes nicely with skills that grant additional damage when at high health.
</li><li> The Lambent Plume is based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun">speedrunning</a>, granting bonus movement and dodge chance every time a room is cleared under a certain time threshold. Like the Pierced Butterfly, picking the Lambent Plume will define an entire run but will pay off immensely by the end if you can pass 20 or 25 rooms in low time.
</li><li> Poseidon has a pair of Duo Boons that do absolutely nothing on their own, save buffing the power of Boons or Poms of Power you gain afterwards. They require an awkward combination of Gods' Boons that ordinarily do not overlap too well (Poseidon and Dionysus or Aphrodite), but if acquired early on will immensely power up Zagreus.
</li><li> Exagryph, the Adamant Rail, is a weapon based around the power of upgrades you pick up for it from Daedalus Hammers. On its own, it is one of the weakest weapons with a short-ranged and inaccurate main attack and a powerful but slow and finicky special attack. Its upgrades, such as Triple Bomb, Cluster Bomb, Explosive Shot and Triple Shot, are however extremely powerful and drastically boost either the main or special attack.

They also have the greatest selection of weapon skills of any class, and can become proficient in every weapon but clubs (which aren't a good choice for a weapon anyway).
</li><li> Less extreme but still eligible is the Wizard class. It starts with a quarterstaff for a weapon and a piddly little Force Bolt for offense (and one random other spell). By endgame, Wizard is by far the most powerful class in the game. Area effect magic, infinite death spells, instantly mapping dungeon levels, instantly identifying unknown items, teleporting at will... all with nigh-infinite MP because of their quest artifact. Oh, and their first sacrifice gift allows for unlimited, instant, semi-permanent Elbereth. And zaps enemies with status ailments. And blocks curses. And is powerful enough to let Wizards play melee, if they so choose. They also get bonuses to Magic Marker use, hungerless casting, self-healing, no-items-needed levitation, Very Fast speed... you get the picture.

If you manage to get one to level 9 somehow, though, they suddenly turn into unstoppable killing machines. To put this in perspective: a level 9 Healer has 95 HP, 85 Attack and 80 Defense. By comparison, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> has 98 HP, 97 Attack and <strong>12</strong> Defense.

Her sole use seems to be getting past the occasional obstacle, and most players will only pull her out for those, ignoring her otherwise. And then comes a level where you have to play as her, and only her. If you then decide to level Xiao up a bit by taking her through some of the earlier stages, you will learn that (a) Xiao isn't actually that much weaker than Toan was at the same level; (b), her weapon is really fast; and (c), having a ranged attack is useful when facing monsters and (d), you can get her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">a slingshot that can steal items upon successful hit</a>. There are also enemies that you <em>do not</em> want to get anywhere near melee range, and enemies that cause your weapons to degrade faster. Xiao is immune to all of these, given her weapon is ranged. Even her randomly-spawning weapons in the first dungeon are ridiculously powerful, sometimes even more powerful than Toan's if the RNG is on your side, becoming Disk One Nukes for an already Disk One Nuke.

<ul><li> The two most useless weapons in the first game are the Straight Sword Hilt (yes, a <em>hilt</em> — blade not included) and the Broken Straight Sword. However, if you somehow manage to smoke the right combination of drugs to think upgrading either of them all the way to +10 is a good idea, you can then infuse your Useless Piece of Crap +10 with the Soul of Sif to get the Greatsword of Artorias, which has the best Holy modifier in the game (allowing you to destroy otherwise endlessly reforming skeletons) and gets very good scaling from four different stats. Infusing the Soul of Sif with any other +10 sword results in a cursed version of the same blade which has narrower stat scaling (giving it a lower damage ceiling) but does pure physical damage, making it better at getting past most enemies' resistances (also, it can hit ghosts, which is situational but handy).
</li><li> Many weapons such as a simple Scimitar or wooden Club are unimpressive to start out but have high scaling with either Strength or Dexterity that only gets higher as the weapon is upgraded, meaning their damage jumps significantly with each point you invest in that stat.
</li><li> Deciding to go into a Faith build can end up like this. Faith primarily affects Miracles, a branch of magic that mostly consists of healing and utility spells, somewhat useful, but doesn't help in dealing damage at all. Only in the late game are offensive Miracles available... but they are a doozy, mostly consisting of chucking lightning bolts at your enemies, which does some hefty damage in addition to looking amazing. Faith builds also get access to Lightning Weapon, allowing them to temporarily buff their weapon with lightning damage, and Vow of Silence, which <em>completely disables all magic</em> for a short time. Equip a Holy/Blessed weapon (which scales with Faith rather than Strength or Dexterity), and a high-level cleric is a force to be reckoned with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> Heralds start out with a Talisman that provides an <em>okay</em> buff to your spells as you work on it. However, of all the talismans in the game, the basic Talisman has the highest benefits at very high Faith investment (50-60).
</li><li> Also from <em>III</em>, Anri's Straight Sword starts out as a quirky but underwhelming weapon that shows up in the midgame, provides incidental healing, and scales off Luck, a stat you probably didn't invest much into. If you take a side trip to Rosaria's bedchamber to reinvest your stats into Luck, however, you'll find that Anri's Straight Sword gets A-rank scaling from it, meaning that it hits like a greatsword and can do massive damage.

</li><li> Super-Robot Thursday, being a robot, cannot reincarnate and gain all the juicy stat bonuses it imparts; he makes up for this with 150% aptitude in most statistics and ability to steal stats, so give him some time and he can be a very powerful character.

One of the first monsters the player is likely to recruit is the basic, run-of-the-mill Slime, with a whooping 8 hit points and next to no attack power. By the time the Slime reaches level 20, it has more hit points than a similarly leveled main character, and is outclassed in attack by only the main character himself when properly equipped. Combined with learning an absolutely devastating spell at level 50, the slime is easily one of the best monsters in the game.

They're the classic DQ monster, you see a billion of them in every game, and they're pretty mediocre... but if you level them up high enough, they learn the MegaMagic spell. What does MegaMagic do, you ask? Why, it's one of the most powerful moves in the game, dumping every last one of your remaining magic points into a super-powerful magical explosion that absolutely nothing in the entire game, including those damned Metal Slimes and their upgraded versions, is immune to.

Jeff does indeed get better in the spirit of this trope, but not through stat growths.

His item selection starts out limited at first, mainly reliant on the above-average-strength bottle rockets, but eventually he can get the ability to immobilize opponents, neutralize any PSI buffs on the field, remove shields, fire powerful bazookas, and especially fire Multi-Bottle Rockets that can one-shot even bosses.

<ul><li> Claves is, when first encountered, extremely weak, with slow attacks that don't do much damage, and unimpressive specials, Presumably this is so you don't waste any time leveling her up, because she dies almost as soon as you meet her. If you go through the game's Bonus Dungeon, she can be re-recruited and leveled up properly, eventually becoming one of the game's strongest characters, placing first or second in every stat, and having some seriously powerful moves. But since she rejoins at the same level as she first left, and thus probably 30 or so levels behind, most people never find that out. The drawback to this is that said bonus dungeon can only be accessed once you defeat the second to last boss, and open a portal that would literally take you right to the final battle.
</li><li> There's also Frederic, who is noticeably weaker than many of the other characters owing to a high magic stat but a poor attack stat. Furthermore, most of his special moves are weak, up until roughly level 60, when he unlocks Phantom Pain, the best damage-dealing skill in the game, capable of inflicting upwards of 400,000 damage with the proper equipment.
</li><li> Jazz in the 360 version. He is at every point in the game inferior to all other characters available. At the end, however, he gets a next to final weapon with an ability called Burst. Burst doubles the power of attacks in exchange for defense. He's the only one with a REALLY strong burst weapon, and the lack of a third burst item means he is the only one who can use burst without one in your three man team. He already did massive damage but other characters had him outsped by far and thus got in more damage than him. In the PS3 version there is now a third burst item and a new character that's a borderline gamebreaker. The existence of a third burst item greatly decrease his value in favor of everyone else.

However, she's the only Servant in the game to have her abilities and growths linked to story progression rather than grinding, and she becomes exponentially stronger with each new unlock, even jumping up from three-star to four-star. This includes her rather mundane party defense buff turning into a defense buff <em>and</em> a damage cut, meaning it makes the group near-invincible to their next hit, her gaining the ability to force enemies to target her and increase the charge on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Noble Phantasm</a>, which synergizes perfectly when she can also make anyone in the party invincible and increase their charge, and said Noble Phantasm getting an attack buff stacked on top. A fully-maxed Mash is considered one of the strongest four-stars in the game.
</li><li> Plenty of Servants to be released early in the game's lifespan were originally designed with two skills, and then had a third added in later on. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>, this third skill is almost invariably their best one, but most can only be reached by pulling them up to Ascension 4 (everyone else gets their third skill at Ascension 3) and doing a sidequest. An excellent example is Arash: he has terrible stats, starts off with two pretty useless skills, and if you take the time to charge up Stella, it's a suicide attack. But if you pull him up to level 50 or higher, then he gains Arrow Construction, which gives an extra 30% charge when maxed. Figure out a way to add the extra 70%<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9ff70');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9ff70" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9ff70');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a non-Limit Broken Kaleidoscope provides 80% at base</span>, and suddenly, Arash can fire off Stella on the first turn. Stella has very high damage that gets boosted even higher in an interlude to make up for it killing Arash, and Arash is super common, so it'll usually be level 5, meaning it'll usually wipe out the first wave. On top of that, by nature of the game's mechanics, losing a weak Servant who's already fired off their attacks is a good thing: it lets you swap in somebody fresh, and since Arash is a one-star, it means his replacement can be very strong.

Slapping this on one of them will instantly make their rather unorthodox build a much better option. Unfortunately, most people will favor Hinako to Daichi, as she maxes her agility out much sooner and will hit harder.

If the Princess produces enough hearts, the egg transforms into the potent Lamb's Lure, an item which can instantly kill any one non-boss character in the battle by turning it into a sheep.

<ul><li> Colette is initially weak, slow, and all around bad. However, once a certain boss is defeated, and if you chose the right side of the T/S gauge (namely S), she becomes the single strongest melee attacker in the game. Her main problem is also that the AI doesn't play her that well either; usually not taking advantage of her pow-hammer techniques or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">stupidly trying to use her magic with long-casting times on enemies that'll interrupt her.</a>

After killing a large number of enemies (and defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>), though, they are easily the strongest weapons the characters can equip, to the point where they'll be doing 10,000 damage per hit. The concept has been replicated in the Tales games developed by Team Symphonia. They were called Catalyst Weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> and the Fell Arms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>.

<ul><li> Jaguna is considered to be the worst character in the game, due to her terrible stat distribution and mediocre skills. For one, she has very low Attack and high Magic, whereas her only magic skill is a weak healing spell and the rest are physical. However, a later patch allows you to Recode her into Jaguna Lambda, with much better skills, and one of the highest total stats in the game.
<ul><li> Interestingly, Jaguna Lambda herself is this. Her stat growth is pretty low, until she reaches level 70, where her stat growth increases a lot. A majority of her stats are gained during level 70 to 90.
</li></ul></li><li> Bonna is valued for her ability to increase EXP gained, but being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Remedy-type</a> character, her other skills are too situational to be useful. Bonna Lambda, on the other hand, is considered one of the best units in the game. She gets a major boost in Attack and gets powerful Bow attacks which cover a lot of area, all of which can activate outside the pincer. Oh, and she retains her EXP increase ability along with her ailment skills, making her a very versatile unit who can still deal tons of damage.
</li><li> Gatz has the same fate as Bonna. His original form is used for his ability to increase item drop rate, but he's mostly a situational utility character with mediocre damage. Gatz Lambda gained an array of powerful Sword attacks, along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game-breaking</a> Augment skills. And just like other Recoded units, he retained his old skills.
</li><li> The two possible starter characters, Bahl and Grace starts out as somewhat strong Sword and Bow units respectively, but tend to fall out in mid-game when you have better characters. However, their usefulness suddely increases when they learn some of their final skills.
<ul><li> Bahl gets the skill Physical Damage x 1.5, a buff which stacks with every activation. With good positioning, she can activate the buff many times in one turn, and deal obscene amount of damage. She's considered the third best physical fighter in terms of pure damage, only surpassed by S'naip and Ma'curi, who also learn the same skill.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Grace gets "Defense -20%, Dragon", which reduces the defense of all Dragon type enemies. Proper usage of this skill allows her to reduce any Dragon type enemies' defense to <em>one</em>, basically making the next attack a one hit kill. Now, consider that this skill works on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Bahamut and Leviathan... This skill was so broken that later patches gave a cap to debuffs, reducing her usefulness.

</li><li> Az'uar's breath ability is initially very cumbersome to use, since it requires Az'uar and Xandra to spend a turn inhaling a rune and casting Catch Breath respectively. The starting breath skills all deal AOE damage and are inefficient for singular bosses. Once Az'uar evolves twice, he can use triple element rune combos, which have high enough damage multipliers to justify their cost. And this is before accounting for lategame skills and equipment that can make the process of inhaling runes faster and safer.

However, he eventually gets the ability to levitate, in which mode he's much, much better at damage-dealing (including splash damage), hits with each button press and with enough hits on the same enemy before the finisher, hits every enemy for increased damage. Also, his most powerful special attack <em>drops the moon</em> on your foes and does at least 3 times as much damage as the strongest special attacks of the other 2 characters.

<ul><li> Several of the archetypes have this feature. Some types of Controllers, for instance, are fairly hapless at low levels when soloing but on reaching high enough levels (and with a selection of complementary powers) become unstoppable engines of destruction that can outdamage the dedicated damage-dealers.
</li><li> Dominators are a very good example. Often considered underdogs, perceived as one of the two weakest archetypes in the game... at least until somebody discovered that, with some careful (and prohibitively expensive) build planning, one could stay in their "Mr. Hyde" mode without having to recharge it between uses. A "permadom" Dominator is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.

Starting out, not only is their health and damage disappointing, unlike Intelligence heroes or higher-tier Agility heroes they don't have good spells for burst damage, making life difficult. By avoiding the enemy's assassination attempts and building gold and levels, though, they eventually become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One Man Armies</a> who eat mooks and their former oppressors like so much popcorn.

At their peak in the hands of a skilled player, Mesmers are hell on earth for enemies, due to the fact that the class's showcase style is turning an enemy's power against himself and making enemies die in a matter of seconds for no immediately obvious reason. However, in any campaign, it takes time for mesmers to find all the specialized skills they need to perform at peak efficiency, and even more time to get over the huge learning curve of the class-early mesmers, and unskilled players, are mildly annoying at best, and have minimal impact on anything.
<ul><li> Necromancers would fall under this category as well. Initially, they seem like one of the weakest classes in the game, only able to deal weak hits and <em>very slowly</em> drain an enemy's health bar, while the Necromancer himself <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">takes damage like a newborn baby</a></em>. However, once you hunt down some of their more useful skills and start capturing elites, they become extremely versatile and devastating in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PvE</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">the sequel</a>, Mesmers again fall victim to this trope. Initially they are very off-putting. Most of the other classes have unique and useful class-exclusive mechanics, while the mesmer's only real power is to create very weak clones of himself, in addition to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>. Later on, with the proper skill setup and trait point distribution, they become absolute monsters capable of piling on damage in many different ways, <em>often all at once</em>, while creating mass confusion by pumping out identical copies of themselves capable of tanking and creating distractions, or exploding for massive damage.

But once you reach max level, you get access to the Couronne Mastercraft Galleon, which is arguably the strongest single ship in the game. It possesses equal or greater firepower than the best warships that Naval Officers can sail, and its armor is much thicker and tougher. It also has the bonus of eight bow and stern cannons, making it quite deadly when approached from any angle, whereas almost all other ships in the game have only two bow and stern cannons.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Terran Republic</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a> 2</em> starts off with some of the worst weapons and vehicles - a carbine that cannot hit anything past 5 meters, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksForNothing">clumsy tank that loses every fight</a>, anti-armor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MAX</a> grenade launchers that cannot kill <em>anything</em>, a weak LMG, etc. However, Terran players can unlock some of the most powerful weapons in the game - said carbine can be replaced by a gun with laser-like accuracy, their SABR-13 assault rifle can out-snipe snipers, those crappy MAX grenade launchers are replaced by dual rotary rocket launchers that can kill enemies from a mile away, etc. The biggest change comes in their Prowler tank, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">which becomes faster, more armored</a>, and can unlock the Lockdown ability, anchoring it in place while increasing its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">fire rate, projectile speed, and reload speed by 50%</a>, which when matched with an armor-piercing main weapon, allows it to kill anything within a mile - air, infantry, and <em>especially</em> vehicles.

</li><li> Likewise, leveling a specific build for a professor is painfully slow and probably requires a lot of leeching exp, but once they reach very high levels, they have very high survivability in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a> situations, especially for a mage class, and they also have a vast array of overpowered support skills for large scale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a>.

It's basically a sickle on a chain attached to a stick, and starts out about as powerful as farming implement on a stick would be. But, if you kill enough vampyres, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">take their corpses to a sacred site and cremate their bodies to release their souls</a>, your skills with the flail magically improve and becomes an extremely powerful weapon (But only when used against vampyres).

<ul><li> The Sealed Sword, which is a 3-star sword that can be purchased following several battles against the Royal Jelly boss. While it is capable of causing random status effects, it only deals normal damage and has the same attack speed and damage as the Kamarin and Grintovec, sans their abilities to stun and freeze enemies respectively, and a far less useful charge attack than the two of them. If you can lug it around until it gets to level 5 (preferably with an extra weapon slot so you don't sacrifice carrying one of your actually useful special damage swords) it can be upgraded into the elemental-dealing Avenger and the shadow-dealing Faust, which can in turn respectively be upgraded into the Divine Avenger and Gran Faust, both of which are incredibly common among 5-star players for a reason.
</li><li> In comparison its handgun counterpart the Antigua, which can be upgraded into the Silversix and Argent Peacemaker or the Blackhawk and Sentenza, is a bit more useful because it deals piercing damage and it can fire off six shots before reloading.
</li><li> The Brandish is a 2-star sword that's basically a reskin of the Calibur with a unique charge attack. It can be upgraded into three elemental variations of it that can set fire to, freeze, or shock enemies, the Nightblade which is one of the only two shadow-dealing swords in the game (the other being the Faust), or the Cautery Sword, which is borderline useless due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>; it's intended for destroying slimes, which shadow weapons already can do with ease.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em>: When first purchased, many tanks have weak engines and even weaker guns, forcing them to crawl across the battlefield to attack enemies they have little hope of damaging. Hanging in there and getting the experience required to unlock some upgrades, however, can make them into powerhouses. Perhaps the ultimate example was the Tier-5 KV Heavy, prior to the tech tree split in Patch 0.7.3. Incredibly slow and initially sporting a barely adequate 76mm gun, it could upgrade to some of the most powerful weapons available in its tier, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">152mm</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">derpgun</a>" which can one-shot many smaller tanks and a 107mm gun capable of penetrating heavy tanks two or three tiers up for significant damage.
<ul><li> One of the biggest offenders is the Tier-6 KV-1S Heavy. The stock configuration results in a slow tank with unreliable armor usually using an outdated howitzer, and it stays this way until the user grinds out every single upgrade. The top configuration that requires over 40-thousand experience? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Medium-like mobility, armed with an extremely painful 122mm cannon</a>, and one of the most whined about tanks in the game.
</li><li> Also a benefactor of this trope is the Tier-4 JagdPanzer 38(t) "Hetzer" tank destroyer (prior to the introduction of the Waffentrager TD line in Patch 0.8.9). If to be accessed via the Tier-3 Marder II, absolutely nothing from the previous TD will be carried on to the Hetzer; while accessing it from the Tier-4 Pz 38(t) n.A light tank will only unlock the <em>second</em> out of the 4 compatible engines. Still, once fully upgraded and in the hands of a skilled player, the Hetzer becomes absolutely murderous on the battlefield, giving positive light to the infamous "<em>Hetzers gonna Hetz</em>" meme.
</li></ul></li><li> Digimon Masters Online: Oddly enough, one of the most popular Digimon in the entire Digimon franchise, Renamon, most definitely falls under this. It's even more prominent in that she gets the 'power' part of this trope upon digivolving to her final form. In this game, Renamon's skills are incredibly lackluster compared to the skills of many other Rookie Digimon. They have long startup with low damage, which doesn't do justice to her original incarnation as being one of the most powerful Rookie Digimon to exist (but, to be fair, her normal attacking capabilities are very good). Evolve it into Kyuubimon, and her second skill's damage also isn't worth its cooldown and mana consumption. Evolve it into Taomon, and you'll quickly get turned off by the enormous startup of her second skill, which deals a little less damage than the typical second skills of Ultimate Digimon. Evolve it into Sakuyamon, and she gets even more pathetic! She sports one of the the longest startup and one of the weakest first skills in the game. And then she has one of the weakest final skills of all the obtainable Mega Digimon, sporting the weakest final skill damage with an above-average length of cooldown. Endure all that however (or find an alternative way to level her up), and you're rewarded with Kuzuhamon. Treated as a Burst Mode in this game and thus given the stats of a Burst Mode instead of a Side Mega, Kuzuhamon is considered the strongest non-Jogress Data Type Digimon in the entire game, capable of dishing out her first and second skills alternatively. While her skills are just slightly better than the average Burst Mode skills in the game, what makes it appealing is the fact that her normal attack stats are hard hitting but slow, in which the 'slow' part could be completely eliminated by using a skill, in which she can quickly rinse and repeat a cycle of dealing lethal blows and throwing out a good skill. She deals an incredible amount of damage in that she can actually KO Digimon in the hardest levels of the Digimon Labyrinth before they get a chance to hit her back. You get all of this by leveling your Renamon all the way up to 65, and leveling starting from level 41 is a very slow and painful process for all Digimon.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Ecaflip</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> are built on this. In the earlier levels, they are lackluster, mid-range close-range fighters with a useless teleport, some very limited healing ability and chance-based attacks that do more harm than good. As they level up, however, they quickly turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> who can heal if the party lacks an Enripsa, whose chance-based skills become a lot more useful. For example, one of their special abilities, which in earlier levels could accidentally heal the enemy, does 1/2 the damage of the Ecaflip's previous attack with no cost when it is fully upgraded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Paladin class. Leveling up a Paladin was absurdly boring. A Retribution Paladin (the damage spec) didn't even get a damage strike until level 40, meaning that they basically threw up a seal and auto-attacked for 40 levels, tossing in a Judgement every 10 seconds (it was so bad that a lot of Paladins leveled in their tank spec, because your damage was hardly any different, but you had extra health and armor, as well as multi-hit abilities). But at level 80 (in <em>Wrath</em>, Retribution was basically non-existent till then), they were one of the strongest DPS specs in the game, if not the strongest. They got toned down a bit, but thankfully in <em>Cataclysm</em>, leveling was reworked so they get Crusader Strike from level 1 baseline and at level 10, either Holy Shock, Avenger's Shield, or Templar's Verdict depending on spec (any of those make leveling much easier than it used to be).
</li><li> Shadow Priests and Shaman. Even with the 4.0 talent changes that get them the fun abilities earlier, they both start out slowly and tediously, only to turn into one of the highest DPS in the endgame if played well.
</li><li> The "Luffa" boss gave the whole raid a particularly nasty debuff which was uncurable and did stack over time. The intent was to just heal through. However there was this level 40 quest reward item... You get the point...
</li><li> On release, Windwalker Monks started out with middling offensive capability, with them primarily relying on Blackout Kick and Tiger Palm to bypass enemy armor, then right before level 60 they learned Rising Sun Kick, which caused all enemies within 8 yards to take an additional 20% damage, and Tigereye Brew, which at 10 stacks from spending a total of 40 Chi on other attacks would grant a 60% damage increase. And when Tiger Palm, Rising Sun Kick, and Tigereye Brew were used together...
<ul><li> Adding to Tigereye Brew's power, Windwalker's pre-<em>Legion</em> Mastery gave you a chance to get an additional charge with a base chance of 20%. If you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">invested primarily in Mastery</a>, you could get 2 charges every other time you spent 4 Chi; the ability held a maximum of 20 charges and you could use 10 charges at once, so you could pop it as soon as you has 10 stacks or wait until you had 20 so you could activate both halves in succession. The results were quite bloody.
</li></ul></li><li> The Elekk Plushie in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> is a nearly-useless battle pet, due to all of its "abilities" being cosmetic in nature. While it can gain XP and reach the same max level as other pets, its only apparent use is soaking attacks. However, if the player defeats <em>every</em> battle pet master with the Plushie on their team, they receive a special achievement and the plushie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy">comes to life as a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy">real</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy">elekk</a>. Needless to say, this is no easy task as some of the masters are difficult to beat with all three pets, let alone only two that are usable.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII">Age of Empires II</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The Turks have late game bonuses such as increased gold mining does little use early in the game, since the civilizations have no pikeman or elite skirmisher upgrades, lousy and their mangonels have no upgrades. Along with them missing a few important technologies in the earlier ages. However, if Turk players manage to age up to late Castle Age and Imperial is where they get their power. For example, their unique unit, the Janissary is the one of the two Castle Age gunpowder units available (The other being the Spanish Conquistador). Their gunpowder units are cheaper, have higher hp, and can be created faster. The Janissary is basically a stronger hand cannoneer with higher damage, better accuracy, and increased range. They also get free light cavalry upgrades, with expert Turk players advancing with hordes of Hussars, Bombard Cannons, and Jannissaries. Finally their unique technology "Artillery" increases the range of their Bombard Cannons, Cannon Galleons, and Bombard Towers.
</li><li> Do <em>not</em> let a Goth player take a heavy lead. Because if the Goth player does, the player will spam a shitton of <em>cheap</em> infantry units and swarm into your base (especially Huskarls where they can even shrug off arrows from castles and towers).
</li><li> Due to lacking long-term economic bonuses they are very difficult to start with, but once they reach Imperial Age the Saracens can kill anything at sight with their strong camels and various advanced ranged units. This is obvious in the second Saladin scenario, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">where the player starts in Feudal Age with little resources, restricted to the Castle Age and many soon-to-be Imperial Age foes trying to kill the player.</a>
</li><li> The Koreans do not have any significant early game economic bonus, and their stone gathering bonus isn't that significant in the early stages of the game until the Castle Age. However, once they start building Bombard Towers, Keeps, and Castles and mass up War Wagons, they are incredibly hard to deal with lategame.
</li><li> The Magyars are considered to be one of <em>the</em> best lategame civilizations. The Magyars not only have access to cheaper Hussar units, but their unique unit costs no gold at all. In addition, they have a very versatile tech tree with mostly full archer upgrades (minus the Hand Cannoneer), full infantry upgrades, and full cavalry upgrades. Their only weakness is their mediocre siege weaponry and somewhat weak defense, and they don't have any significant early game economic bonuses across from the free Blacksmith upgrades for melee units. This is also highlighted in Honfoglalás scenario. The player starts out with a few villages where the Pechenegs come and attack the said villages. The Magyars then settled near the Khazars as a refuge from the Pechenegs, but the Pechenegs still continue to swarm the Magyars which forces them to retreat again. The Magyars then settled forward west with a few Pecheneg attacks, but the attacks were stalled when the Byzantine empire request help from the Magyars to defeat the Bulgarians. The Magyars defeated the Bulgarians which earns them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> label from the Bulgarians. Then the Magyars are forced to retreat <em>again</em> from the Pechenegs. The scenario ends with the Magyars conquering Moravia, abandoned their nomadic ways, settled in, and adopted a lot of European customs (including Christianity).
</li><li> The Portuguese are incredibly weak early game since their gold discount bonus doesn't play into the later stages of the game and don't have any significant early game economic bonuses until they get the Feitoria building.
</li><li> The Vietnamese are very comparable to the Portuguese in retrospect. Both are team dependent civilizations that don't have any strong economic bonuses early game and many of their civilization bonuses only have a bigger impact in later stages of the game. This means the Vietnamese in 1v1 situations will get destroyed by early game civilizations such as the Malay, Vikings, and the Huns (not to mention, the Paper Money tech, where each Vietnamese ally get 500 gold, will be incredibly useless in 1v1 games). That being said, should the Vietnamese snowball the game, they are a very feared lategame powerhouse with not only tanky archers and Battle Elephants, but also having one of the best trash units with Imperial Skirmishers, meaning they can easily hold off in trash wars.
</li></ul></li><li> The British civilization in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII">Age of Empires III</a></em> is incredibly slow to start off with, but in the 4th and 5th ages their epic Musketeers and rocket artillery form some of the strongest armies in the game.
<ul><li> The Dutch and the Portuguese as well with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>. The former has a slow start since their settlers cost Coin instead of food but can build banks to balance it out. Later on, they get excellent ranged cavalry with only 1 population instead of the usual 2, enough coin to afford <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">expensive mercenaries,</a> unlocking the best halberdiers the game has to offer, and one of the best naval city card bonuses including the powerful fluyt unit. The latter has the lack of settler card bonuses, thus leading a slow economic build up but if players can memorize the map using the Portuguese explorer's ability to use the spyglass, and get a Covered Wagon with every advanced age. Meaning, experience Portuguese players in the late game can spread their base around for resources while having the best naval bonuses, excellent dragoons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">light infantry,</a> and their musketeers that rival the British.
</li></ul></li><li> The Panzer Elite Grenadiers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em> start out as very expensive for what they give, poorly armed, few in number, and quite vulnerable overall. However, they can be given a truly staggering number of combat upgrades, including weapon packages, new abilities, a squad size increase, and even more upgrades depending on the player's preferred tactical doctrine. Fully upgraded, Grenadiers are hands down the best core infantry choice in the game, comparable to the elite infantry of the American army.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> An Imperial Guard Squad at the beginning of the game can't shoot, can't fight, dies like flies, and runs screaming in terror at the slightest problem. By the time you reach tier two, the 5 man squad is now 13 men, 5 of them have heavy weapons, and with a commissar, the IG Squad is unbreakable and can fire twice as quickly as normal. In this state it is the most powerful non-unique infantry unit in the game. Watch the Space Marine terminators die before they reach range...
</li><li> The Ork army is this. At first you only have Slugga and Shoota boyz, with minimal squad numbers and abilities that suck outside their namesake and are crap without backup. Fully upgrade them and outfit them, though, and a full squad of slugga-boyz can rip through any other unit in the game.
</li><li> While all commanders are no slouch during the campaigns, the Chaos Lord stands out in that he starts out squishy like the Space marine commander, but after obtaining his last upgrade (daemonic ascension) he permanently becomes a Daemon Prince, who is powerful enough to go toe-to-toe with any of the relic units in the game. Because he's your commander though, you get him as soon as the mission starts.
</li><li> For about the first half of the <em>Dawn of War II</em> campaign, Cyrus deals pathetic damage, dies easily and is the epitome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulStealth">Useless Useful Stealth</a>. Level him up, give him a sniper rifle and various explosives, and allocate the right traits to him (especially the ones that make his stealth <em>incredibly</em> useful) however and he becomes the single most versatile character, effective against all enemy types, and with careful player oversight is capable of soloing missions.
</li><li> A piece of equipment, the Heavy Bolter for both Space Marines and their Chaos counterparts. It trades off damage capacity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">rate of fire</a> and suppression. <em>Squads</em> carrying heavy bolters can be devastating, but equipping a single hero with it is underwhelming, as many times "kill it dead" outweighs "make it not be able to run at us as fast" as a strategy, especially since (typically) two of your other heroes are melee oriented. But the semi-random wargear drops (and one named drop) have a single effect that trumps all others: "Cause X% damage in an area." This coming from a gun with likely the highest rate of fire in the game, equipped to a character who has hopefully taken the skill that lets them ignore the "set up" timer before and after moving, and <em>each shot fired</em> causes a small explosion; suddenly those massive hordes swarming your lines are not so massive.
</li></ul></li><li> In the PC strategy game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em> (1997) by Bullfrog Productions, you must build training rooms to train up your monsters; and a few monsters will become far more powerful at maximum level. Demon Spawn, while moderately good fighters at low level, become Dragons at level 10. Thieves can be trained into Knights, identical to the Lords of the Land you've been fighting. Even the lowly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Imps</a> get this. As workers, their fighting ability is pathetic, so most players won't bother. But at level 3, they get Haste, letting them mine through stone like a buzzsaw, and at level 10, they get the ability to Teleport.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a>'s Grand Strategy Games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun">Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron">Hearts of Iron</a></em>) there are plenty of examples of nations with very difficult or limited starts, but whose expansion avenues, unique ideas or other bonuses make them extremely powerful if you can overcome the initial handicaps of picking them:
<ul><li> <em>Victoria</em>'s Germany starts out divided into loads of weak one province states that are effectively irrelevant compared to other monster countries like France, Spain, or Great Britain. However, with some skill (or just a constant series of wars) a player who conquers enough German states can create Germany who's sheer size and population can make it one of (if not THE) most powerful countries to play in the game, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun">Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun</a></em> where a united German state gains so many advantages it basically becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. That's right, a entire nation is a game breaker in this game.
</li><li> Kingdoms in India from <em>Europa Universalis</em> qualify. They start out with a far steeper technology curve than European powers, their religions (Sunni Islam and Hinduism) are statistically inferior to the Christian religions, and even the strongest powers are at best mid-weight by <em>1399</em> European standards (and they fall back further as time goes by). But! If an Indian prince grows strong enough, it can declare the Kingdom of Hindustan/Bharat, which controls an area nearly as large as Ming China, without Ming's governmental flaws. And as for the technology issue, that can be solved by westernization, which will rapidly lead Hindustan to exceed Europe in tech level.
<ul><li> In <em>Victoria</em>, Punjab is one of the few Indian states that isn't under Britain's thumb, and thus stands a relatively good chance of working it's way up to GP status and kicking the British out of India. A good player can do this by around 1870. Heck, <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?568991-Subcontinental-Subtleties-An-experimental-comic-AAR">one of the most critically acclaimed After Action Reports for the game was Punjab<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Japan in <em>Victoria</em>. Anyone who knows anything about Japanese history will know that those backwards island fools with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">fancy swords</a> might not look like much, but wait and see when they drop the traditions and start getting things like guns, railroads and factories. Indeed, Japan starts out as a small, uncivilised country in East Asia, but it gets a huge bonus to westernization and industrialisation. This combined with a disproportionately large and relatively well-educated population means that Japan stands a very good chance of becoming a modern, secondary world power, capable of dominating China, Southeast Asia and the Pacific rim. In fact, in the hands of a half-decent player, Japan can easily reach GP status.
</li><li> China in both <em>Victoria</em> and <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, for all its notorious status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">nigh-unplayable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, is an absolute <em>monster</em> once it finally gets it's shit together and gets past a plethora of hideous issues including widespread government incompetence and corruption, a hilariously backwards stance on scientific development and public education, constant rebellions and a terribly inadequate military that relies mostly on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">overwhelming numerical superiority</a>. The AI will never manage it, but some good players can and have done.
</li><li> Bahmanis in <em>EUIV</em> starts as a moderately-powerful regional power in the Indian subcontinent, with some stellar national ideas and Vijayanagar to the south as the only real threat. If you can survive their assaults and take their territories and those of Orissa, you can form Hindustan and gain <em>permanent</em> claims on <em>all</em> remaining Indian territories. A unified Hindustan is a monster with limitless potential: resources and population to rival Ming with superior government bonuses and a very strong military, plus possibilities to ally with Muslim nations in the middle east and even the chance to do a bit of colonization in Africa and Indonesia.
</li><li> The Anarchist faction in the Spanish Civil War in <em>Hearts of Iron IV</em> is the most difficult faction in the civil war to play, and even if they do come out on top they have the problem that everyone hates the anarchists and won't ally with them. Should you survive long enough to unlock the late ideas that form the Iberian Defence Council and the later Global Defence Council, the result is an utter monster of a faction that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualClass">ignores many of the core rules on how to rule or expand a nation</a>, chief of which is its ability to core any territory in the game simply by taking it.
</li><li> Byzantium in <em>Europa Universalis IV</em> has a nightmarishly difficult start, being nine years away from their historical conquest by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttomanEmpire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Should you survive that and re-take the offensive, Byzantium has a number of unique events and powerful Ideas from the <em>Purple Phoenix</em> pack that grants them powerful short- and long-term bonuses.
</li><li> <em>Crusader Kings 2</em>'s historical starts features a single Mongol ruler actually present on the game map, a single-province nomad chieftain who is a tributary vassal of the much more powerful Kara-Khitai Khanate in 769. Unique amongst the steppe nomads, Mongol rulers have the ability to declare themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> should they control enough of the steppes, which grants huge amounts of prestige, additional troops arriving from Mongolia, and most usefully prevents the game's historical Mongol Invasion from ever taking place.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr. Neurocide</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a></em>, who can be recruited very early in the game, is worthless in a straight fight and thus very difficult to level. On the other hand, both of her unlockable special abilities are <em>spectacularly</em> useful in certain situations; she can blast an area with a hallucinogenic gas that masks anything affected and keeps agents from noticing it, meaning they can walk through the middle of your <em>morgue</em> and not pick up on it, and she can also deploy a nasty knockout gas that'll plant pretty much anyone, Super Agents included, flat on their butts if they get stuck in it long enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty">Majesty</a></em> has an extremely annoying character type. The wizard. When first hiring the wizard, he will be extremely weak, going up against the weakest sewer rat is a death wish for a level 1 wizard. However, nurturing them to higher levels will make them unstoppable killing machines.
</li><li> There's plenty of examples in MOBA's like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOTA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOTA2">DOTA 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is the whole point of the Carry: to start with, Carries are utterly useless in the early-game, depending on what hero your team is using to fill the role. But halfway through, assuming they have managed to farm enough, suddenly, they turn into lean, mean killing machines capable of winning 1v5 teamfights and singlehandedly felling an entire lane - hence the name, since they tend to "carry" the rest of the team. They are normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>, and are often ranged characters (though there <em>are</em> exceptions). Some noteworthy extremes of this role include:
<ul><li> Medusa, who can turn mana into a shield and attack everything in range on zero cooldown. When you have no items, you'll have very little mana and hit like a strawberry, so these abilities are only useful once you've purchased items to increase your mana and damage. Once you have mana you'll almost never die, which means buying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Divine Rapier</a>, which gives a <strong>massive</strong> amount of damage but drops when you die, is suddenly worth considering.
</li><li> Spectre, who can reflect a portion of the damage she takes to enemies in an area. As in, the enemies take that portion of damage <em>instead of Spectre</em>. Problem is, this ability isn't at all threatening unless your opponents have a reason to attack you and you can take some hits. Get some gold and buy the right items and these problems disappear. Spectre's natural damage output is also lackluster without damage items or illusions.
</li><li> By no means is Yasuo a slouch in the early-game as a melee carry, but he's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">a pretty fragile</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a> at that point; allow him to free-farm however, and he'll potentially induce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe">Total Party Wipe</a> in the late-game depending on his build.
</li></ul></li><li> Characters who have unique resource mechanics also fit in this category.
<ul><li> In the early-game, Thresh is incapable of doing much damage on his own and is very fragile as his passive <em>Damnation</em> prevents him from gaining armor as he levels up. To compensate for this, it has an effect in which enemies that have been slain near him give up their souls (sometimes from minions, but <strong>always</strong> from heroes), and he can claim them to not only boost his armor, but to increase the damage of his spells. Come the late-game, when he's harvested enough souls, he's more than capable of taking as much damage as he dishes out.
</li><li> It can be hard to pull off, but Gangplank's <em>Parrrley</em> ability gives him a unique currency in the form of Silver Serpents as soon as it's used to last-hit anybody. Normally used to get more gold, but in the late-game, when enough Silver Serpents have been collected, you can upgrade his ULT to either do more damage to enemies closer to the center of the blast radius, buff your allies' movement speed as long as they're in the blast radius, or to have the barrage last longer.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies2ItsAboutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies2ItsAboutTime">Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time</a></em> has several plants that are initially outclassed, but qualify as they level up via the Plant Leveling System.
<ul><li> The Bonk Choy is pretty much outclassed by many other plants a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant">Close-Range Combatant</a>, doing rapid but very weak damage. However, it levels up very quickly and its damage increases extremely fast when it does so, killing a basic zombie in just three rapid punches, and coneheads in eight.
</li><li> The Bloomerang. Your first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">One-Hit Polykill</a> plant, it becomes quickly outclassed by the Laser Bean and Fume-Shroom, both of which can hit infinite targets as opposed to Bloomerang's three. Like Bonk Choy, it also levels up very quickly, the number of targets it can hit increases, its cost decreases by a lot, its damage increases very well, and soon it'll be killing groups of zombies in less than five attacks — at maximum level, three of these can take down a <em>Gargantuar</em> before it reaches them. In spite of this, it's <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">leveled Laser Bean</a>, which destroys lanes of zombies with ease, even bucketheads and knights.
</li><li> The Bowling Bulb starts off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> due to the way it works. It has three bulbs, a small green one, a medium blue one that does 3x the damage of the green, and a large orange one that does 1.5x that of the blue, and recharges them in green&gt;blue&gt;orange order. The problem occurs when there are zombies in its lane once all of its bulbs are used — it will recharge then fire out the weakest bulb all the time, making it weak for its sun cost. Once it gets to level 3, however, the recharge order changes to blue&gt;orange&gt;green instead, essentially <em>tripling</em> its damage per second by firing and recharging blue bulbs. Get it to level 7 and it recharges the <em>orange</em> bulb first, further increasing its already good damage.
</li><li> Pepper-Pult is initially seen as a weak version of Melon-Pult, having a slow recharge time while dealing rather weak direct damage and negligible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">Splash Damage</a>. Its only use is to warm or thaw plants in a 3x3 area near it in Frostbite Caves, something that the stronger Fire Peashooter and Jack O' Lantern are capable of. However, leveling up Pepper-Pult turns it into an incredible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember">Support Party Member</a>, as its very useful warming effect grows in area size, eventually reaching a massive area of the map. At maximum level, simply placing a few in the middle lane will keep all your plants warm or thaw them out extremely quickly. Plus, its recharge time and damage increase as well, making it more useful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em> gives you the Lookout or Observation Post, a largely useless structure whose only purpose is to provide large LOS. It can't be moved, it has no ground attack and minor anti-air attack with normally no air units to shoot at, and you could just as easily use a couple strategically placed Explorer units or patrolling Cavalry. But once you reach the Industrial Age, it turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">the Air Defense Gun</a>, which can destroy biplanes in four or so hits while costing little more than the Lookout. In the Modern Age it turns into the even-more-powerful Radar Air Defense, which has massive range in addition to being a superpowered airplane-killer, so you can make nine or ten and set up an <em>impenetrable flak curtain</em> that will effectively deny your enemies any form of air support. But its greatest evolution has to be in the Information Age, when it turns into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissileLockOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissileLockOn">SAM installation</a>. These consist of three homing missiles arranged on a little tripod thing, which will be ripple-fired at the first sign of an enemy plane, and which then will be reloaded in seconds. Build multiple ones for a bomber-killing, fighter-vaporizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>. <em>And all of these auto-target.</em>
</li><li> The Kol Battleship of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">despite its glowing description in lore,</a> has poor antimatter reserves, unflattering damage and can be beaten by most other capital ships in a duel. However, with enough levels, its antimatter reserves grow to the point where it can use its abilities much more freely and the Finest Hour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> can dramatically turn a bad situation around. <strong>Then</strong> it becomes the beast the story claims it to be.
</li><li> The UNSC in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfTheProphets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfTheProphets">Sins of the Prophets</a></em> initially have to outnumber the Covenant many times in order to win. By late game, the gap closes, such that the Orion Battlecruiser or Thermopylae Supercarrier only needs two-to-one odds to beat a Covenant capital ship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> has the Zerg. Due to their peculiar method of creating units, they are <em>extremely</em> vulnerable to early attacks, but if left alone long enough, they will bring forth armies of Ultralisks (highest HP of all ground units) and Guardians (a flyer that outranges <em>every</em> defensive structure and ground unit). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>, replace Guardian with Brood Lord (in addition to huge range, every attack will now spawn Broodlings).
<ul><li> The humble Zergling. Made two-for-the-price-of-one (at 50 minerals, it's the same as every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Unit</a> and the Marine) and pretty much exists only to be spawned and die in large numbers. However, by end game it gets upgrades that increases its already impressive movement and attack speed, letting it <em>shred</em> apart armies... when spawned in large numbers.
<ul><li> The sequel takes it even further, by giving all Zerg units speed bonuses when on creep. It also gives them an invisible creep spreader that lets their armies move lightning-fast across vast distances. Oh, and they can now morph into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bombs</a>.
</li><li> And <em>even further</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm">Heart of the Swarm</a></em>'s campaign (once you've progressed far enough), where Zerglings can now jump cliffs/spawn instantly and three at a time, while Banelings either split into smaller Banelings or gain the ability to jump into enemies over their allies' heads. And just to put the cherry on top, one of Kerrigan's passive abilities lets you respawn killed zerglings at a steady enough rate that you can almost continually sweep large amounts of zerglings all over the map without fear of leaving your base defenseless.
</li></ul></li><li> in the co-op commander mode, Dehaka is, at the very start of any match, the single most useless hero unit with terrible DPS, awful range, and low attack. The thing is, he's the only hero that levels up as the match progresses, and by level 15 he's an armored, anti-air, instant-killing, ally healing, debuffing, AOE monster with ridiculous attack and high health. You can <em>practically</em> solo normal and casual maps with just him and not a single other unit from either army once he starts getting up there in size.

<ul><li> Parthia starts out with some of the most financially poor starting cities in the game which are separated by huge tracts of empty wilderness, making troop waypointing tedious and leading to high corruption. They are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> faction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">pitiful infantry</a> (in a game where infantry is the backbone of any serious army) and their best units, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher">horse archers</a>, require serious practice and micromanagement to use effectively but even then are terrible at capturing cities. However, when powered up enough, they can become the ancient equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">the Timurids</a>.
</li><li> The Greeks start out with scattered territories and enemies all around them. In fact, it's not uncommon for them to be one of the first major factions to be eliminated. However, if they survive, they get some of the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> infantry and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">most profitable provinces</a> in the game.
</li><li> The Seleucids have good units (including overpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">phalanx</a> units in several varieties) but start with numerous enemies on all sides. If they survive until the late game, they get Silver-Shield Legionnaires, who are every bit as good as Rome's.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Portugal. Early game, laughable militia and light infantry. Late game, tied with Spain as the best overall army list.
</li><li> Scotland. One fairly impoverished town province with Highlanders (admittedly fairly good light infantry), Peasant/Highland Archers (<em>terrible</em> archers), no crossbow or gunpowder units at all, and only the bog-standard knights along with Border Horse (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">fast but poorly armed and armored light cavalry</a>). The Scotland faction usually just gets steam-rolled by England in the first few stages of the game. However, if you hang in there, you end up getting Highland Nobles, Noble Swordsman and Noble Pikemen (respectively: <em>very</em> good and cheap heavy infantry, Dismounted Chivalric Knights but cheaper and on steroids, and the second-best pikemen in the <em>whole game</em>), access to Knights Templar and Hospitaller guilds, access to gunpowder and crossbow mercenaries, and the cheap and fairly-decent Noble Highland Archers unit.
</li><li> Russia starts out with a few poor provinces at the very top corner of the map, and their starting roster isn't particularly impressive either. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a> gives way to Mid Game Hell when the Mongols show up, but by then hopefully you will have fortified your defenses and your armies will be much better - you will have top-notch cavalry along with heavy troops like the Boyar's Sons and the Druzhina. When you fully upgrade the walled cities, you get the powerful Cossack Musketeers which are on par with Italian musket troops, and you get them <em>automatically</em>.
</li><li> In the popular <em>Medieval II</em> mod, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirdAgeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirdAgeTotalWar">Third Age: Total War</a></em>, the Free Peoples of Eriador.

Yes, 9 provinces sounds good, but most of them can't pay for their own upkeep, and you mostly just have crappy militia that can only win through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> tactics. Get hold of a sea port, build up some infrastructure, encourage growth in your poor provinces, and research some technologies, and Russia becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">a very different beast</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2">Total War: Shogun 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Otomo clan are Christians, which means everyone in Japan hates their guts. Their initial leader is dishonourable, adding to the public order penalties from Christian/Buddhist conflicts. They start with a matchlock unit, but it isn't very good and costs a ton of upkeep. They share an island with the extremely aggressive and expansionist Shimazu. They start at war with two factions, who also happen to be allied to each other. However, if you overcome all these downsides, you'll find yourself swimming in money (thanks to foreign trade ports), armies bristling with matchlocks (which are short-range, but MUCH more powerful than bows) and nigh-unstoppable fleets (thanks to European-style ships armed with cannon).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Ikko-Ikki</a>, thanks to their Jodo Shinshu Buddhist faith and rejection of the feudal system, are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> of feudal Japan, and as such don't have any samurai units besides the somewhat limited katana/bow/yari ronin. They do, however, have very powerful warrior monks, including <em>matchlock</em> monks, as well as the ability to take over provinces via rebellion! Their main problem is, however, the simple fact that monks take quite a while to acquire, moreso if you want to upgrade your blacksmiths and fletchers beforehand.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Uesugi</a> clan also specializes in warrior monks, but must survive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a> of their terrible starting position. If they can overcome that than they have the potential to become a terrifying powerhouse in the late game. Fielding tons of warrior monks who'll get boosted stats from blacksmiths or fletchers, and also be cheaper to recruit and maintain. All while making tons of money thanks to their extra trade income.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">Total War: Warhammer II</a></em>:
<ul><li> Alarielle suffers from the same problem in both the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns: she starts in control of only a single settlement with a Dark Elf faction right on her doorstep (and poised to grab the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Sword of Khaine</a> if they feel like it), her economy can barely support the High Elves' notoriously expensive units, and the facilities to use her unique perks are witheringly expensive. Additionally, her unique mechanic means she starts of with penalties to public order and diplomatic relations, and her already-shaky economy takes a further hit. Manage to beat back the hordes and establish a foothold before her allies turn on her, though, and she can make great use of having one of two hybrid armies in the game while that same mechanic turns around into a massive buff that easily allows her to ally with every other High Elf faction.
</li><li> Tomb Kings in general can be this compared to usual mechanics. They have strict limit to every unit type except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> basic skeletons which increases by unit production building itself, and you have very poor income from your cities. Even your armies in general are limited strictly, so you could not simply conquer more land to get more resources from more cities. But on tier 3-5 they have constructs which are so powerful that can be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. The key to strategy is ravage enemy territory instead of expansion to quickly construct expensive buildings in your starting city instead of investments into newly obtained.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Night Elf Archer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em> is the weakest of all basic units. However, once you reach the late game you can improve range and damage, make it ride a hippogryph, a flying anti-air unit greatly increasing HP and mobility and unaffected by melee attacks. And since they can dismount, attacking aerial units find themselves suddenly facing twice the targets dealing more than twice the damage.
<ul><li> The Siege Engine starts off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> that only works on buildings (though admittedly it is quite good at doing so), but upgrade Plate Armor and Ranged Weapon damage (when ranged units generally use leather armor), add in its rocket upgrade and watch the enemy's entire air force disintegrate under a hail of missiles, while their weapons just bounce off its armor and then plough them straight into their base and destroy it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarlordsBattlecry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarlordsBattlecry">Warlords Battlecry</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both Dwarven factions qualify. Their initial units ranges from average to rather bad, with Dwarven Infantry being rather underwhelming and Stone Golems being way too slow to use them much. Then, they unlock much better units: Crossbowdwarves are the best garrisons in the game, Dwarven Berserkers are almost indestructible to physical damage and Iron Golems can hit everything around them at a decent speed. Both factions unlock Siege Weapons around this time. And at the final stages of the game, both are essentially unstoppable: Dwarves get Runelords (dangerous magic units), Kazhrimi Guards (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>-spamming soldiers with a tanky streak) and Generals (extremely tough, and can rip buildings apart like no other), while Dark Dwarves get Bronze Golems (almost unkillable unless the enemy has lightning, and they hit like trucks), Hellbores (imagine a lightning-shooting AA cannon that could take down dragons) and Flame Cannons (the single hardest-hitting thing in the game aside from titans, they can incinerate an army and their base in seconds). The fact both get expensive but powerful armor and damage upgrades that span the whole tech tree only adds to it.
</li><li> Fey. Their units will remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a> to the end of the tech tree, with cheap, tiny, zippy units that hit for very low damage, though quickly. However, they have a tremendously useful upgrade line in their Orb Of Wonder, which gives units extra experience right out of the assembly line. The upgrade line is <em>enormous</em>, possibly the longest in the game, but leveling up mooks in this game will turn even a lowly pikeman into a menace. Due to the way upgrades work, these tiny units benefit even more from the extra experience, as the damage increase is a flat raise for everyone, even if they stab you five times per second. Not to mention they get even faster, and they remain just as spammably cheap as before. Thus, if you don't wipe out a Fey faction early in the game, you will be swarmed by tiny men and women with spears and magic bolts that will inflict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> on you faster than you can wipe them out.
</li><li> Knights qualify as well, and have a similarly hard time getting to the levels where they can be useful. Their starting units are basically <em>worthless</em>, and their mid-tier units (Knights and Dancing Swords) are just enough to keep them afloat. But once they get past the first few hurdles (easier said than done due to money problems) they get access to Knight Champions and Knight Lords, which are extremely tanky slayers of evil that can get upgrades to experience and thus level freakishly fast (see above for why this is dangerous), as well as Archons, literal angels with flaming swords that make short work of anything the Knights can't handle. While you need dozens and dozens of Dancing Swords to fend off most attacks, a tiny group of just five Archons and three Knight Lords can squash that attack <em>and</em> charge forwards to carve a hole in the enemy base right afterwards.

Additionally, characters cannot move and cast magic in the same turn, making it hard for mages to catch up to physical units. However, if they're promoted enough, mages can learn all kinds of powerful AOE offense and support spells. They also have access to good endgame staves that boost their range and damage further, allowing them to cherry tap several enemy squads at once. Some advanced mage classes have access to slingers, giving them more ranged options outside of spells and making it easier for them to steal kills.

He's a rookie who's units have reduced attack power in exchange for a meager 20% discount on manufacturing units, and one of his first major missions is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold The Line Style</a> setup which goes out of it's way to remind you he is useless. Of course, later in the game when the strong units (Like Battleships and Bombers) are in use, his weakness is suddenly a moot point since his units are <em>still</em> doing tons of damage and that discount means you're saving thousands of bucks on new units. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Happy smashing!</a>
<ul><li> The sequel <em>Dual Strike</em> allows you to team him up with Kanbei, his polar opposite who has insanely strong units that are much more expensive to produce. This is one of the strongest teams in the game and the two don't even get a tag bonus.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders3">Age of Wonders 3</a></em> has a similar mechanic but with a greatly expanded number of units that "evolve" after they hit gold-level experience. Most races have a low level units that gets promoted to a better unit in this way, which is fairly easy to do, whoever getting a Dragon Hatching or a Baby Kraken to evolve takes a lot more work but consequently produces an absolute monster.
</li><li> The Sorcerer leader class is another example. Unlike every other specialization they get one class-specific unit that is built from cities; every other one of their unique units is summoned. Because of the way casting spells works <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14f9gh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14f9gh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14f9gh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You have a set amount of casting points per turn, spells cost some of this, if you don't have enough the spell take several turns to cast</span> they can only have one unit being summoned at a time, often taking several turns, while all the other classes can pump out as many units as they have cities. In addition to that the amount of spells you can cast is shared between the world map and the battle map, meaning if you go ham on the casting at the start of your turn you can wind up with no spells available for battle. However, once you get some research under your belt all of the Sorcerer's spells and units have an insane amount of synergy, and their ultimate unit is basically lightning Cthulhu. If that wasn't enough their ultimate spell creates a persistent world effect that increases the casters total casting points and cuts the mana cost and casting point cost of their spells <em>in half</em>.

When Orion is at 0 energy, his moves are amongst the worst in the game with low AoE and healing/shielding potential. When Orion is at full energy all his moves are greatly powered up, making playing him a balancing act between knowing when to ult (which consumes all your energy) or staying with the ultimate ability on backburner to get the most out of his other moves.
</li><li> Common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, particularly in the case of younger civs and former colonies:
<ul><li> America's special units tend to appear late in the game, around the Industrial Era, but when they do those B-52s or F-15s or Navy SEALs will hit hard. And in <em>Civ VI</em>, America's unique Film Studio buildings can only be built after the discovery of Radio, but will help the civ win a late-game Cultural Victory.
</li><li> Australia is pretty unassuming until the midgame, when it can start building Outback Stations whose bonuses improve over subsequent eras. By the lategame Australia will have turned marginal terrain into fuel for thriving coastal metropolises that can help it win a Scientific Victory.
</li><li> Brazil in <em>Civ V</em> has a difficult early game since its start bias is for jungle terrain, meaning that not only is it stuck with a lot of unproductive real estate, it's also likely to share borders with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">the Aztecs</a>. But in the Renaissance era, between the University's bonuses and their unique Brazilwood Camp improvements, those jungles become the most diversely-useful tiles in the whole game. Bonus points: not long after that, Brazil picks up the Pracina unique unit.
</li><li> England is a naval power geared towards building an intercontinental empire, but you can't even cross oceans until the Renaissance, so for roughly half the game England won't be anything special. But once it hits its stride, those Redcoats and Royal Navy Dockyards and Ships of the Line will help England lock down control of the world's oceans and conquer lands anywhere.
</li><li> India in <em>Civ V</em> has a special ability that encourages it to develop "small but tall," with a few high-population cities instead of a sprawling empire. This means that in the early game an opponent doesn't have to do much conquering to knock them out of the game, but if India persists, it'll end up with a small number of well-developed and well-defended cities - especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticPsychopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticPsychopath">Gandhi's</a> AI puts an emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear weapon production.</a>
</li><li> Venice has a very precarious early game because it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity">can't found other cities</a>, so one bad move can be fatal, particularly if its neighbors are people like Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun or Montezuma. But as the game goes on, Venice will start making boatloads of cash from all its trade routes, enough to simply buy whatever military units it needs and bribe every city-state in the world to its cause, assuming Venice doesn't make puppets from them with its unique Merchants of Venice.
</li><li> The Zulu in <em>Civ V</em> are oddly both this <em>and</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>. They have nothing really going for them in the early- or lategame, but in the medieval era get access to their unique Impi unit and its special promotions, allowing them to go to on a spree of conquest before gunpowder makes them obsolete.

<ul><li> The "Est archetype": a character that joins the party late and it looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> is in full effect, since he or she is quite fragile, but if the player is patient and levels him/her up adequately, after promotion the character will become extremely powerful.
</li><li> The Troubadour class in the games it appears starts off as a mounted healer, meaning their magic is worse than the Clerics who usually show up first, and they can't defend themselves at all. They also rely on healing to level up, which is decidedly slow. Once they promote, they can become Valkyries (or sometimes Mage Knights), which have access to offensive magic. This turns them into unbelievably versatile units, combining high attack range, speed, and access to what will probably be a high staff rank. As an added benefit, their speed makes it fairly easy for them to stay safe long enough to reach that stage.

Despite the fact that they join prepromoted and give signs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>, if you look at their stats, you might be surprised because of how low their bases are.

</li><li> Tailtiu is the last character that joins you in the first generation. She's a level 3 Thunder Mage, has a serious gap to bridge, and is hampered with the fact that the next chapter has her elemental weakness, Wind Mage, aplenty. The player can still make her promote at the level she joins (leaving all villagers unsaved for her to reap the golds to buy a Paragon Band, then level up immensely in Arena), and she will be able to hold on her own until her generation ends... in which with a proper pairing (with either Azelle, Lewyn or Lex), her children Arthur and Tine, who join very early unlike her will be a duo to be reckoned with, though not to the extent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> One non-Est example is Leif, who joins in the 2nd chapter of the 2nd half (that starts with a new group of characters) and starts out as a mere swordfighter, but can eventually use almost every weapon in the game.
</li><li> Finn zigzags between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>. In the first generation, he starts off quite weak and is disadvantaged by the fact that he uses lances when the first chapters are full of axe-users, but because of his good growths, the Prayer skill and the Brave Lance Quan gives him in chapter 2, he becomes a valuable asset to your army until he leaves (at the end of chapter 3). Then, in the second generation, he is normally much stronger than the characters he's protecting (Leif and Nanna) at the beginning of chapter 7, but because most of your army can be made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>, he ends up being outclassed in the last chapters.

<ul><li> In general, most units who can promote into a Sage count in <em>Thracia</em>, including Asbel, Linoan and Sara.
</li><li> Asbel starts in a good position as he joins early as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> with an extremely powerful personal weapon which helps him during the early stages and turns him into an amazing boss killer. The promotion into Sage increases his durability a lot, and with only 7 levels with the help of the Sety Scroll, he is guaranteed to have maximum speed, and a good chance to have an acceptable magic and skill, both of which are boosted in high amounts by the promotion bonus. As far as offensive magic goes, the only character who can outdo Asvel is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> Olwen, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a> Ced.
</li><li> Homer is a prime example of Magikarp Power. He joined underleveled in a rather difficult and pretty late chapter, followed by a chapter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a>. He specializes in Light Magic, which is rare, and he can't even use the Nosferatu tome that you acquire at the same time he joins the team, and he can't use Wind Magic. Then you realize that he has the <em>Elite</em> skill to double his exp gains, he has stat growths that are even better than Asbel, and he has a PCC of 5 which means on his second attack he has a massive chance for a critical hit. He also promotes into a Sage, which allows him to use staves (a huge plus since staves are poorly balanced in <em>Thracia</em>, although Homer is not expected to have a high staff rank in Endgame), an extra rank in the elemental magic and 2 ranks in light which allows him to use better tomes including Nosferatu and the Wind spells. It helps that Sages have a promotion bonus that looks like something out of <em>Genealogy of the Holy War</em> which is REALLY massive when compared to the current standards and <em>Thracia</em>'s standards alike.
</li><li> Linoan and Sara join in a late chapter rather underleveled with no personal weapon, and Linoan is forced to promote with a late game event. However, Linoan can use the Nosferatu tome from the start and is likely the only person who can use it, and she can wield staves, helped by her solid stat growths. Sara later gains a personal weapon that is rather useless other than giving access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">That One Sidequest</a>, but she has a better starting staff rank than Linoan, massive growths, can promote earlier than Linoan, and her skillset is filled with three of the best skills in the game, which includes <em>Elite</em>. And they happen to exist in a game where having a good staff rank right from the start is an equivalent of winning a grand prize in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a>.

Roy has mediocre bases and average growths. His promotion is forced through the story extremely late when the rest of your army will be well into their promoted classes. If the RNG is kind to Roy, then he can become very powerful when he promotes to Master Lord and obtains the Binding Blade, the most powerful weapon in the game and canonically the strongest weapon in all of Elibe.

However, once he's gotten a Heaven's Seal, he promotes to Knight Lord, giving him a horse to considerably increase his speed and access to lances (and by extension, javelins to increase his range). If you've been bothering to level him up, he becomes a very viable unit at this stage.
<ul><li> Nino, who joins at level 5 about 5 chapters away from the end of the game. She also has some of the best growths in the game, and can be made very powerful if you're willing to slow yourself down. Less extreme, but also applies to the likes of Bartre, Rath, and Heath.

<ul><li> A straightforward example is L'Arachel, the only Troubadour in the game. When she's recruited, she's simply a mounted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a>, which is handy for mobile healing but no good for combat and therefore both vulnerable and agonizingly slow to level up. She's also far inferior to Moulder and Natasha, who have had several chapters to gain staff ranks and levels. With the patience to finally get L'Arachel to level 20 and promote her into a Mage Knight or Valkyrie, however, she has been known to clear the first floor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell">Bonus Level of Hell</a> <em>by herself</em>, often gaining her remaining twenty levels and capping several of her stats in a single mission!
</li><li> By the time that Amelia joins your army in either route, she will be woefully underleveled. She's a level 1 trainee unit with less than 20 HP when the majority of your units will be in the low to mid teens. She can easily be one-rounded by any enemy in the chapters she joins in. Training her requires a considerable amount of babying to feed her kills. Once she promotes to her next tier of classes, she may still require a bit of babying in the very early levels. Once she begins to catch up in level to the rest of your army, she has the potential to become the best unit in your entire army. If she doesn't cap her Strength, Skill, Defense, HP, and Speed, then she will end up with very high stats in all categories. She can turn into a General who takes little to no damage from every attack, if she doesn't dodge the attacks, and can double virtually every enemy in the game, including Swordmasters who are known for high Speed.

<ul><li> Astrid starts out so weak that most enemies on her joining map one-shot her. However, she has the personal skill Paragon, which doubles her XP gain, and if trained she rather quickly catches up and then surpasses the other characters in levels. Not only does she get great stats, but her promoted class, Paladin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">is extremely broken</a>. On top of that, she's an archer, meaning she can pick up those first few levels pretty easily by scratching enemies at range.
</li><li> Sothe is an intended example, but tends to fall flat. He boasts the Blossom skill, which increases his already pretty good growth rates but reduces XP gain. Sothe tends to be trouble to train, but when he does level up, he sees massive gains. Unfortunately, he can't promote and is in a class not meant for combat, meaning he tends to not do well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>:

He can statistically expect to cap every stat in the game save Magic and Resistance at 20/20/20. However, in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a>, the early parts of <em>Radiant Dawn</em> are not kind to Magikarp characters like him on the hardest difficulty, and you quickly get the Swordmaster Zihark who fares only slightly worse than him in exchange for requiring far less investment.
</li><li> Laura also counts, but she takes the trope WAY too far. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> with insane growths in both Magic (third-best in the game, behind Micaiah and Soren) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">Speed</a> (tied for best with Elincia), but not only can she not use offensive magic until she promotes, <em>she starts at level 1</em>. Staves also give <em>painfully</em> low EXP.
</li><li> Meg is an interesting case. Many people immediately write her off, but if raised patiently, her stats can turn her into a very effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Mage Killer</a>. However, like many Dawn Brigade units, her growths are at odds with her base class... which is Armor Sword. Between its low mobility and total lack of ranged physical weapons, this is perhaps the class least suited for mage-hunting, and Meg's mediocre HP and defense mean she can't do her class's traditional duties worth a damn. So while her numbers show a case of Magikarp Power, her usability remains questionable at best.
</li><li> Vika is this. She has one of the <em>worst</em> availabilities in the game (if not the <em>entire saga</em>, being a new character introduced in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>) yet she has pretty high growths for a Laguz. It takes a lot of babying, but she pays off. Her main problem is also that she joins very late, and in the rest of part 4, you have the Laguz Royals, so there's really no point in using her when you can take Naesala if you want a raven with you in the final battle.
</li><li> Sanaki veers into this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> territory. She joins very late in the game and has a few powerful weapons, but is marred because <strong>a)</strong> you've had three parts to train your other characters, <strong>b)</strong> her strength is so low she takes a penalty from using her own special weapon and <strong>c)</strong> she has <em>very</em> low health, making her the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.

He joins with pathetically low stats and in the weak Villager class that can't even promote.

Even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> reflects this trope; initially he sees himself as weak and useless and the whole point of his sidequest is to convince him otherwise by <em>letting him get a Level-Up</em>. Unfortunately, he still manages to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Tier-Induced Scrappy</a> due to factors besides his stats<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16vdx0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16vdx0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16vdx0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mainly the fact that the Villager class exclusively uses Lances, but none of the classes he can 'graduate' to can (they're the Mercenary and Fighter lines), meaning he has to spend ages building up a Lance rank for nothing.</span>, but luckily the 'Aptitude' skill can be inherited by his kids (who <em>don't</em> have his bad start), turning them into utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>.
<ul><li> The saddest thing about Donnel is that if he were in any other <em>Fire Emblem</em> game besides <em>Awakening</em>, he'd be instant top-tier material, because he joins <em>much</em> earlier than other Est-archetypes (his mission becomes available after <em>chapter 3</em>), and therefore he has the entire rest of the game to level up. But because <em>Awakening</em> lets you reset a unit's level as many times as you want <em>and</em> grind endlessly for experience, Donnel's growths don't matter nearly as much in the late game as his stat <em>caps</em>, which are mediocre at best and easily outclassed by other units.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mozu, who just like Donnel, starts with the Villager class. When she's first met, she is rather weak, but she can become one of the most powerful units. Unlike Donnel, she <em>can</em> promote, and her two class choices, Master of Arms and Merchant, both utilize lance-class weaponry, so her weapon rank isn't wasted. That said, the developers noticed what her combination of early availability (like Donnel, she's available almost from the word go), growth-boosting skill, and overall usability could result in, so she's doesn't get as powerful as many Ests.
</li><li> Elise is similar to L'Arachel above, only even more extreme. Starting off as a mounted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a>, her growths in Magic, Speed and Luck are insane, and once promoted to a class that can use offensive magic she's able to utterly <em>demolish</em> most physical enemies with even basic E-Ranked tomes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">She still has the defense of wet tissue paper though</a>, but when she's fighting something she can one-round kill without fear of a counterattack, this hardly matters.

<ul><li> Bows. While useful early on for chip damage, with the exception of the Mini Bow (which cannot make follow-up attacks at close range), they lack the ability to counterattack at close range, which can leave archers a sitting duck on enemy phase. However, upon reaching C Bows, every character learns Close Counter, which allows bows to counterattack at close range, effectively rendering weapons such as Javelins and Hand Axes obsolete. On Maddening in particular, bow usage is basically mandatory on every character that isn't a mage (even characters with bow banes such as Sylvain), due to the abundance of -breaker skills on enemy units but a notable absence of Bowbreaker.
</li><li> Magic in general. The Commoner/Noble class has half the spell charges of proper magic classes, meaning characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Linhardt and Mercedes</a> can be rendered effectively useless after expending all their charges. However, upon promoting to a proper magic class, this becomes less of an issue, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Warlock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">Bishop</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Gremory</a> classes even provide double charges.
</li><li> Most students, plus Byleth and Flayn, have a budding talent that usually starts as a neutral skill, or in the case of Dorothea's Faith, Felix's Reason, and Lysithea's Swords, a weakness. However, when the budding talent blossoms, the character becomes proficent in that skill (even if they were weak before) and learns a unique combat art or skill. (In particular, Sylvain's Black Magic Avoid +20 cannot be learned by any other character and provides an alternative to bows for ranged combat)
</li><li> Ferdinand's personal skill, Confidence, provides a flat +15% to his Hit and Avoid so long as his HP is full. While this skill will likely only be active for his first round of combat in the earlygame, in the lategame, when Ferdinand's stats are higher and the player has access to Avoid-increasing battalions, this skill makes him into one of the best evasion tanks in the game. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note172eb6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note172eb6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note172eb6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As a Wyvern Lord, Ferdinand's evasion can easily go over 100%.</span>
</li><li> A more conventional example is Cyril on the Blue Lions and Golden Deer routes. He can be recruited in Chapter 5 as a Commoner when the rest of the player's team is likely already in Beginner classes and working their way into Intermediate classes. However, Cyril's personal skill, Aptitude, gives him good growths, and his proficencies (lances, axes, bows, riding, flying) allow him to easily become a Wyvern Lord or Bow Knight, considered the two best non-exclusive classes in the game. He also learns Point-Blank Volley at C+ Bows, allowing him to cheat out doubles earlier than any other character, which can be useful on Maddening. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18dj4e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18dj4e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18dj4e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only other character to learn Point-Blank Volley is Leonie, who doesn't get it until A Bows. Its lance counterpart, Swift Strikes, is learned by Ferdinand, Sylvain, and Seteth, all at A Lances.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A hidden example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations">Galactic Civilizations</a></em> where, if you have your race take the morally good path you find out about Telepathy - that almost all telepaths born with severe physical disabilities, they don't survive in the evil races, but if they do... What this means is that, as you're a good race and look after your people, then you get access to a series of telepathic defensive technologies which are far more powerful than anything else at that tech level.
</li><li> To get a wizard to learn the Arcane Omniscience skill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> V</em>, you need to let them learn a specific set of skills <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1978ft');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1978ft" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1978ft');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Sorcery, Enlightenment, and War Machines</span>, which means neglecting their other skills and being forced to rely on their army and low level, low power spells for most of the early-to-mid game. Once they learn Arcane Omniscience, however, they instantly have every spell in the game added to their spellbook, and can cast them all at expert level mastery.
</li><li> Two examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc">Jeanne d'Arc</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rufus joins alongside La Hire as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">second axe user</a> and La Hire's assistant (in a way). His starting stats are rather low, but if one gives him the time, he will start trumping people with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">(intentionally) overpowered armlets</a> late-game, he easily surpasses La Hire and Bartholomeo.
</li><li> Colet, the game's only knife-wielder and the Thief-type character. The manual points out that knives are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">physically weak, but have a very high critical hit rate</a> - and sure enough, the player does indeed see this early on. Unfortunately, the early game knives are <em>very</em> weak weapons, and they do not hold up to the other weapons even <em>with</em> the bonus damage from critical hits. However, while Colet's skillset will make him useful throughout the game (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing">Stealing</a>, being able to produce ladders or bridges), he <em>truly</em> starts to pay off mid-game when his weapons start to boost his base damage to the point where the critical hit bonuses catches up to the other weapons <em>and</em> when he gets "Two Hits" and "Three Hits", resulting in Colet being able to shred through bulky enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Relena Peacecraft</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration">SD Gundam G Generation</a></em> series is a practically a textbook example of this; since she's a politician and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> in her home series, her initial stats are all incredibly low (except for her Charisma). But if the player is willing to tough it out, her late-level stat gains are so incredible that she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Woman Army</a>, and she's an excellent candidate to power-level any new mecha since her stats can more than make up for any weaknesses or flaws in the machine.
</li><li> Despite being a mandatory character, Ibis Douglas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Wars Original Generation</a> 2</em> is like this. Her primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> is potent, but her stats are so low she lags behind... until you get around level 50, when her stat-gains start going out of control and she ends up the best character in the game. However, unlike many, this is frequently alluded to in-game, with multiple references to her "potential."
<ul><li> She's also like this in her debut game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a> 2</em>. And she's also a main character.
<ul><li> In Alpha 2 she only gets a massive stat boost as part of a plot event in stage 32 (namely finally shaking off her self doubt and loathing. Before then leveling her to max won't help her any. In fact weak Ibis and strong Ibis have separate character data. Strong Ibis has a few different abilities (and loses a useful ability weak Ibis had that helped keep her alive though you no longer need it at that point) and her outfit in game is different.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Gundam 0083</a>'s Kou Uraki's a more reasonable example, combining with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>. Kou starts out underleveled and in an inferior machine. Between leveling up and getting the GP-03, you realize problems with him in the past didn't come from himself, but simply his machine.
<ul><li> And then he gets the GP03 Dendrobium Orchis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">a Gundam with as much size, HP, and Armor as a typical super robot, while still being able to dodge like a normal Gundam</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The other traditional example in the later games is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MazingerZ">Boss</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>. He starts off in a terrible machine with low stats and little value except a cheap repair cost. However, if you level him high enough (usually around 80) his subpilots get a ton of incredibly useful spells for dirt cheap and his stats go through the roof. In addition by this time you'll usually have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em>, which means that Boss can get out of his terrible machine and upgrade to Mazinger Z. The trick is that level 80 is absurdly high in a game series where the final bosses rarely get above the mid-70s. There are ways to level him up that high, but they're generally inefficient or a lot of trouble.
<ul><li> The Borot itself is often a kind of Magikarp Power - while it starts out with terrible stats and no ability to hit airborne enemies, its weapons are extremely cheap to upgrade and become <em>stronger</em> than those on Mazinger itself. With four part slots, you can easily buff up its stats and give it flight, fixing its anti-air issues.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Turn A Gundam</em> is the most infamous one. In any game you get it it starts out underpowered, but after it unlocks some of its attacks and abilities (such as flight, Moonlight Butterfly, and HP Regen), it's a powerhouse. Also, Loran's stats start jumping when he passes around level 50.
</li><li> Also in Alpha Gaiden, all the originals are pretty much useless. Especially Ryusei, who starts out as the worst due to being in an MP mecha. Most people don't use him since you only have him for a couple stages <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before the time jump</span> and you get him back pretty late into the game. However, he has a VERY high melee stat from the start, and once he starts getting into the higher levels he learns incredible skills (his starting Psychic ability can hit L9 and he gains Guts, Support, and Shield Def), a wonderful spirit list, and once his stats start jumping up, he becomes one of the best pilots in the game. But he's still so-so until he gets R-1 Kai, which has one of the best barriers, the TK Field, and great stats.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance">Super Robot Wars A</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Portable</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Bright Noa</a> and his battleships fall under this in a way. They start out as plain battleships, which can slowly repair and resupply units inside it, do some damage, and have easily accessible MAP attacks, but suffer from low accuracy and are generally best left out of the way. However, if you painstakingly get Bright to 50 kills, you unlock his Ace Bonus, which is one of the best in the game. When a unit retreats into Bright's ship, instead of taking several turns to be back to 100%, they're completely ready to go in one turn, allowing them to quickly get back into action with none of the Will loss that comes with being resupplied by a Resupply unit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV">Super Robot Wars V</a></em> gives us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Ange and her Vilkiss</a>. Vilkiss by itself has quite a bit of attacks that aren't really impressive for a protagonist unit but as the game goes on, Vilkiss gets quite a bit of load out in its attacks including a MAP attack that's available around halfway through the game, and gains its Ariel Mode that gives a small percentage of completely dodging an attack. Its custom bonus gives it medium amounts of EN and HP regen so it can at least survive at the front lines. At the climax of its plot, Vilkiss gains a post movement final attack since its final attack for most of the game isn't one and uses range stats (though Ange's stats are almost equal anyway though she slightly prefers melee). As for its pilot, Ange starts the game with <em>zero kills</em>, forcing players to babysit her for most of the way till she gets her ace bonus which is one of the best in the game as it allows her deploy with 25% more SP compared to the rest<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20ej7v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20ej7v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20ej7v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV">Super Robot Wars V</a></em> has units start deploying at half their SP just like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a> Jigoku-hen and Tengoku-hen</em></span> and some bonus evasion and hit rate. Finally when she achieves Great Ace, she'll deploy with full SP, allowing her to burn through her spirit commands and still have enough to cast whatever she needs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Morrigi, who are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>. Their destroyer-class ships are fragile and strategically sluggish. Their population growth, terraforming ability, research speed and industrial growth are awful. However, if you know how to play them and get them to lategame, you find they have good to great chances at the best techs in the game, and their dreadnoughts are monsters.

However, they have faster research speed than the rest and similarly good to even better chances at the best techs than Morrigi. A Liir player who can avoid getting crushed in early game will out-tech the opposition with frightening speed.

</div></li><li> The Sniper class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a>.</em> Unlike other classes, Snipers at "Squaddie" rank aren't much more useful than a basic Rookie, since they can't use their weapon in a turn they've moved, and can't actually see far enough to make the most of their rifle's long range, giving them the mobility of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> without the stopping power to offset it. The real change is once they make it to Corporal, thanks to the most important skill choice in their career:
<ul><li> "Squadsight" lets the Sniper shoot at <em>any target their teammates can see</em> so long as the line of fire is unobstructed. A max-level Sniper with the "Squadsight" and "In The Zone" perks can in the proper circumstances clear several pods of enemies outside of cover in a single turn so long as they have ammo in the rifle. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Enemy Within</a></em> nerfs the ability by completely negating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> chance for shots beyond the Sniper's own line of sight unless the signature Headshot skill is used, and that one has a cooldown of several turns; still, a Squadsight Sniper with the "In The Zone" Colonel skill can wipe out <em>a lot</em> of aliens with base damage alone.
</li><li> "Snap Shot" was worthless in the core game due to the very high aim penalty (-20), but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Enemy Within</a></em> buffed it to a modest -10, that can be negated by carrying a S.C.O.P.E. item. A Snap Shot Sniper is for all intents and purposes a regular operative that carries a massive battle rifle into combat, with all the other skills the Snipers get; at a high enough rank, the aim increase is so high that the penalty barely matters. And unlike their Squadsight pals, Snap Shot Snipers make full use of the very high innate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> modifier of their weaponry<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2185j8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2185j8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2185j8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">25% on the ballistic rifle, reaching 35% on plasma tier; by comparison, the second closest weapons, the Assaults' shotguns, stay at a fixed 20%</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion">Yggdra Union</a></em> begins the game as a relatively useless character with stats well below every other character in the game (excluding the summonable extras). However, halfway into the game, she will gain an upgrade that not only turns her into a character on par with some of the strongest characters in the game, but also gives the Always Ace ability, the equivalent of arming her with the ability to abuse nearly every card in the game. That, added with the final equip Fanelia can turn her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> that can literally OHKO every single unit in the bonus stage by herself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhMonsterCapsuleGB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhMonsterCapsuleGB">Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule GB</a></em>, some monsters are very weak at first, but can become very powerful if you level them up and use an Evolution Chip.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsterColiseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsterColiseum">Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</a></em>, some weaker monsters can evolve into stronger forms under certain conditions. Dark-type Monsters are this in general, as they start out weak and have costly summons, but if trained can prove very powerful.
</li><li> Maury from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission1">Front Mission 1</a></em> joins your unit at a very low level and without any skills <em>well</em> after you have more wanzers than you can deploy at any one time (even if you've ignored optional members like Alder or Gregorio) and she also won't earn her first short skill until a comparably high level, making it easy to put her on the back burner and forget about her. While it can be tempting to train her in melee since she can learn melee skills early, that would be throwing away her potential with guns as she happens to have the best natural skill progression in short-ranged attacks and highest accuracy in the game. If you put in the hour or so needed in the colliseum to raise her level to match the rest of your party, arm her with a pair of machine guns, and have her learn switch, she will become a literal killing machine capable of completely obliterating enemy wanzers in a single turn.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite">Bioshock Infinite</a></em>, there's the Pistol and Machine Gun. The Pistol starts off as a fairly weak weapon which is good against minor enemies but not against other ones. Most gamers ditch it for other weapons. But if you stick with it and upgrade it fully, or have the correct gear, it becomes a weapon that provides fast fire, solid performance at all ranges, carries up to 31 rounds when you get to Soldier's Field and is an excellent sidearm overall. The Machine Gun is effective early on, but it isn't as good against tougher enemies. Fully upgrade it, and use the Bullet Boon or Ammo Advantage gear, and the Machine Gun will suddenly have a massive clip size, carrying even more bullets than the Crank Gun, is as effective as the Shotgun from close to medium range, can take out enemies with in a few shots, and will almost never run out of ammo because it's the most common weapon in the game.

His skill choices are either extremely narrow in application at low levels or just not useful enough to carry him through like the basic skills of the other characters...or it might just kill him outright by delaying his shield recharging or setting himself on fire. Level him up high enough, though, and he can become a damage-dealing monster, able to slaughter entire hordes of enemies while healing himself or chaining enough damage to annihilate raid bosses in an ever-increasing rain of blood-explosions.
</li><li> Of all the weapons in <em>Contra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile">Homing Missiles</a> starts out being the weakest, which while the missiles home onto enemies, they otherwise act like the player's default weapon bullets in terms of damage and rate of fire. However, if you can find another Homing Missile pickup, you can fire <em>two</em> streams of homing missiles simultaneously, which makes the weapon more deadly. Couple that with both rate of fire upgrades and you have a monster on your hands. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium">If you can keep a hold of them, that is</a>.

<ul><li> <em>Jedi Outcast</em>: Force Lightning and Force Grip start off very weak when you first get them, with Lightning barely doing any damage to enemies, and Grip only being able to stun enemies for a few seconds. At their highest level, you can clear out entire rooms with Lightning, and use Grip to fling enemies off of ledges and disarm them, which is useful for quickly ending lightsaber duels.
</li><li> <em>Jedi Academy</em>: Force Rage. It makes you stronger while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">eating your health</a> and making you <em>more</em> vulnerable to damage for a few seconds after it ends. At level 1, health drain is HUGE and your strength increase is... not. It doesn't last very long, and the time spent doing the activation pose <em>does count,</em> and you can take damage during it. When it ends, and all or most of the enemies you were trying to use it against are all still there, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">you.

<ul><li> Your starting weapon, the plasma cutter. Upgrading it improves it so much that it's entirely feasible to use no other weapon for the duration of the game. There's even an achievement for doing this.
</li><li> The Pulse Rifle chews up ammunition FAST, does barely any damage, and has a ridiculously small hit area. If you upgrade it though, it can become an incredibly accurate and ammo-economic limb remover from over 100 meters.
</li></ul></li><li> The Grinder in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a>: Guerilla</em> is somewhat like this; when you first get it it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> with a slow fire rate and shots that sometimes aren't an instant kill (on hard at least), after getting the explosive upgrade (which between the higher damage, splash damage and building and vehicle damaging capabilities makes it FAR more versatile) and the fast shot upgrade (which fixes the weapons biggest flaw) it becomes a good all-round combat weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Handcannon, which can't even be purchased until you've beaten the game at least once, and whose ammo is incredibly rare, making it pretty much a paperweight once you own it. Spending a ridiculous amount of money to upgrade it, however, gives it infinite ammo and a firepower rating that lets you one-hit-kill pretty much everything in the game. The only problem is you get access to it so late in the game and after so many proofs of prowess, it's at best a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>.
</li><li> The 9mm handgun you begin the game with is arguably the weakest firearm in the game. However, once you max it out it becomes five times more likely to get a critical headshot which, so long as you hit enemies in the head, virtually turns into a one-hit-mook-killing machine.
</li><li> Same with the shotgun found in Pueblo which, while far from <em>useless</em> is still swiftly outclassed by better weapons. Max it out and it gains the unique attribute which ignores pellet dispersion and averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">Short-Range Shotgun</a>: now if only so much as a single pellet fired hits an enemy at any distance, they take the same damage they'd take <em>if hit by the entire blast at point-blank range</em>. Suddenly the thing is able to floor entire crowds with a single-shot, something no weapon other than the rocket launcher or a grenade is capable of doing, and can easily blow multiple heads off per shot which is something no other weapon can do.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion">Albion</a></em>:
<ul><li> In principle, all spells work a little bit like this, because they only start to function properly as advertised after some practice (i.e. dozens of castings). However, it's really exemplified by some of the most powerful spells, such as Demon Exodus (destroys all demons in a battle) and Goddess' Wrath (destroys all enemies). Yes, they'll do that eventually, but it takes a while before they do anything at all to speak of.
</li><li> Melthas, who is almost completely useless. His only offensive spell is Small Fireball — the weakest offensive spell in the game. His healing spell isn't much better either. All of his other abilities are support spells which will almost never be used when you can just freeze the entire battlefield with Sira (who will ALWAYS be in your party if Melthas is). That changes when he gets Demon Exodus, and upgrades it to at least 50% of its full power, at which point it will instantly eliminate all demon type enemies (which include both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">most powerful</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">most irritating</a> non-human, non-technological enemies in the game) on the field.
</li><li> Harriet's Wrath of the Goddess. When you first learn it, it will use up all of her energy (and quite a bit of her health if said energy is not on 100%), and disintegrates a single enemy at most. Develop it to 100% and it's an instant I Win button, as it will destroy everything except Ned's type 2 androids. Of whom you will only have to fight one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dual-classing in general. You abandon your old class and start taking levels in a new one, which suppresses all of your old skills until your new class becomes a higher level than your old one (so if you, say, dual-class from thief to mage at level 7, you need to hit level 8 as a mage before you get your thief skills back). Dual-classed characters usually have to spend a lot of time playing 'catch-up' to the rest of the party and gain no HP until their new class bypasses their old one, and it is crippling if a vital party member (like a thief) does it while you have no spare, but the end result is a whatever you dual-classed into with the HP and skills of the first class stacked on top of its own. Applies less in the second game, where it's easy to just take some of the benefits of dual-classing without the cost; several potential party members are already dual-classed, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> could just switch right at the start of the game and catch up quickly, as the first dungeon gives a lot of experience (from spell scrolls).
</li><li> The sequel gave us the Sorcerer class. Initially it seems far weaker than a normal mage. Instead of learning spells from scrolls, it can only learn a total of 5 spells per level, which are slowly chosen over the course of level-ups. In other words, make any bad picks and you're screwed. Even the official strategy guide for <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> recommends against choosing a Sorcerer. However, the Sorcerer is able to cast an unprecedented 6 spells per day of every spell level (an amount only outdone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesAreForHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesAreForHumans">Edwin</a>) and can pick which spell to cast on the fly, flexibility only matched by a Reckless Dweomering Wild Mage (but without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">wild surge</a>). In <em>Throne of Bhaal</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">tenth-level spells</a> learned by wizards as high-level abilities don't count against the Sorcerer's limit of learned spells, the Sorcerer dominates the Mage.
</li><li> The Monk (also in the sequel) starts the game almost crippled by high armor class (high being bad) and the fact his fists don't count as magical weapons. By the time he hits high levels, not only are these problems long cured, he also gains insane magical resistance and fists that can outdamage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Katanas</a>.
</li><li> With the <em>Ascension</em> mod installed, that +2 Sword of Chaos that you've been carrying from the first dungeon in <em>Shadows of Amn</em> will become a +4 weapon with better special abilities if you give it back to its original owner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarevok</span>.
</li><li> Aerie. She starts as a multiclass mage/cleric with 16 points both on intelligence and wisdom, making her decent but singularly weaker than other mages and clerics (especially Edwin and Viconia, who however are evil characters and might not fit in a good alignment party with Aerie) and slower to level. This is of main importance in early game where the party is still weak to fight against some bosses and high-skilled specialists perform better against them than an all-around character. However, when she levels up she becomes able to choose sequencers from both wizard and priest spell pools which results in many interesting combinations. Though she can become an excellent tank with the right equipment and spell enhancements, it is best to keep her in the back while using her to cast spells from a safe distance, making her also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.
</li><li> Anomen is even more blatant. He is a dual classed fighter into cleric with 18/52 strength, 10 dexterity, 16 constitution and 12 wisdom. Considering that dexterity can be raised to 18 very early with a pair of magical gloves, this results in a pretty decent fighter stopped at level 8 and a rather mediocre cleric still progressing. However, he gets a quest that, if successful, might increase his wisdom to 16. Thus making him a flexible good cleric also capable of melee tanking (with the added thac0 bonus and extra proficiency points of a level 8 fighter).
</li><li> Thieves in the second game. They are still needed to detect and disarm traps and to unlock chests without sacrificing dedicated spell slots, but there are no traps or locks that require more skills than those of a thief like Imoen: she is permanently fixed at level 7 thief since she dual classed to a mage before the beginning of the game, while other characters progress up to level 18 or 19. Specialized kits like the assassin or the bounty hunter might get a little more momentum, but still they are complexively not as indispensable as in the first game. However, with the expansion Throne of Bhaal, thieves at higher levels start to gain many incredibly powerful skills, like the ability to wield any weapon, even those that are normally forbidden. Imagine a backstab multiplier applied to Carsomyr or after setting up time stopping traps...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> An archer rogue, more so than any other class, fits this role, especially if you want to invest talents into lockpicking. While melee classes such as Warriors and Dual Wielding Rogues get access to decent weapons sooner and mages start out strong and just get stronger, an archer is...somewhat underwhelming in the early-game thanks to a lack of decent bows and relatively weak initial talents. However, archers have extremely powerful late-game talents such as Scattershot, which does better than normal damage to <em>and</em> stuns just about every enemy you're facing at once and is almost impossible to resist, and Arrow of Slaying, which can deal up to several hundred points of damage with one hit (up to 10 times normal damage in the right circumstances), and is perhaps the best way to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">enemy casters</a> before they get in range to do real damage. Several of the unique bows that are found later in the game are also very powerful. By the endgame, a properly built Archer Warden will be <em>the</em> best damage dealer in your party.
</li><li> The Bard specialization starts out rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">spoony</a>, as the base stat buff and initial skills compare very poorly to all other specializations. But the effects scale up with Cunning, which a smart Rogue develops to increase their lethality. Since the song effects the entire group, the value is multiplied by each conscious teammate. In the end, there is no specialization across all the classes that is as powerful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general throughout the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">"Mage" and "Thief"</a> based builds are almost always weaker to start out and have a much tougher going early in the games than their "Fighter" oriented counterparts. However, after leveling up a few times and getting higher quality equipment/spells, these builds quickly outpace the pure "Fighters" and reach massive levels of power. While they're busy trading blows with enemy mooks, skilled Thief-types can, for example, have wiped them all out with <em>x30 damage</em> critical hit sneak attacks while Mage-types can have dropped them all with a mass Paralysis spell while their powerful summoned creatures tear them apart, both without having taken a single hit in return. However, as seen under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a>, you can still find yourself at a disadvantage if you're forced to fight an enemy you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulStealth">can't sneak up on</a> or who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">immune to</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">reflects</a> your spells, so it is wise to have a Plan B.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the start of the Dark Brotherhood questline you're given a crappy little dagger that is basically useless compared to everything else you have. At the end of the brotherhood quests, the dagger gets enchanted and becomes a fairly powerful enchanted weapon that, if nothing else, will get you a decent amount of money if you sell it.
</li><li> There is also the Chameleon spell, which would make it possible to sneak well, but even with 97% Chameleon, you would be found by enemies after the first strike on them, seeing as they are all somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic</a> (which made it a waste of magic against multiple enemies). However, if you managed to get 100% Chameleon (which could be done permanently), you would essentially never die, as only scripted characters or monsters could find you. Add max sneak, and you could have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">6x damage on every attack in addition to the invisibility</a>. To get this with a spell, armor would often lower the percentage and ruin it, forcing you to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleStreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleStreaker">Invisible Streaker</a> (if underwear had not been grafted on to your body).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> Thief skills. These abilities initially are nothing impressive: with pickpocketing you can occasionally find good loot in someone's pockets, sneaking lets you avoid getting in fights, speech nets you slightly higher prices, and lock picking makes opening locks a little easier. Invest in their perks, and once you've built up your experience with them, you can sneak during combat with an enemy, allowing you to steal his armor and weapons while he's trying to find you again, then drop a few bottles of poison in his pocket, causing him to die instantly, or you can use a dagger to slit his throat, which, due to sneaking's perks, will do as much damage as a Daedric warhammer to the face would (x15 sneak attack critical damage with a Daedric dagger is insanely powerful, and with an easily found enchanted item found in the Dark Brotherhood questline, you can easily make it x30). Then you can search whatever treasure chest he was guarding and get much better loot due to lockpicking's perks, which you can sell for drastically higher prices at the store.
</li><li> Archery. Initially, the damage isn't impressive, but an Ebony bow and arrows will, from a base, unperked sneak attack, drop many foes in a single shot (Draugr Deathlords with Ebony bows can drop even a heavy armor-wearing character in a couple of shots). Sneak allows you to change the damage bonus for sneak attacks with bows from x2 to x3. This is enough to kill just about anything short of a dragon or high level dungeon boss with a single shot once you're using Ebony or higher.
</li><li> Alteration magic, to some extent. Yes, the various armor buffs can be useful, but a Destruction-minded mage may prefer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Lock</a> her enemies so they never reach melee range, while a Conjuration specialist may let his summoned minions do the fighting while he hides in the next room. But once your Alteration skill approaches level 75 you can buy the Paralyze spell, which will render the majority of enemies helpless for ten seconds or more. Start a Wall of Fire underneath that Draugr Deathlord and watch him burn, and if he starts to get up, just zap him with Paralyze again.
</li><li> Crafting. Sure, a little Smithing boost to your equipment is nice, but limited since you can't use it on enchanted gear, and at starting level, any Enchanting that you do yourself will be vastly overpowered by loot that you find in the world. Spend some time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">power-leveling</a> these skills and investing in perks, though, and soon enough you'll be smithing gear far superior to anything else available and laying down skill-boosting enchants that can make you an expert at melee, archery, magic, or thievery. And that's without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">abusing an infinite loop of Alchemy, Enchantment, and Smithing buffs that can create gear so powerful it crashes the game.</a>
</li><li> In the realm of follower characters, there's J'Zargo. An overconfident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> when you meet him, he's the only character in the core game (and only one of four with all the official DLC) who never stops leveling up with the player. What holds him back, though, is the poor design of the Mage AI - J'Zargo will never get any better spells, the damage of spells doesn't increase with level, and he doesn't use any weapons you give him. While the player ought to be using weapons that far outscale the Master level spells, J'Zargo will contentedly throw his Novice and Apprentice level lightning magic until he runs out of magic and engages the dragon in fisticuffs.
</li><li> Light Armor. The starting armor you get won't even give you 50 Armor points where the starting heavy armor (if you side with Ralof) will give near 100. But, when combined with smithing above will allow you to reach the armor cap with with only Elven armor, which is one of the lightest in the game, lighter than leather in fact. This will allow you to ambush most of your targets while taking only scratch damage from everything but giants and higher level dragons and draugr. You'll also be able to carry more loot/potions/backup weapons because the full set only weighs 9 pounds.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em>: The Summon spell initially summons a weak wasp that deals pathetic damage and doesn't last for very long. But if it lands a killing blow on an enemy stronger than it, it's permanently replaced with said enemy. With a bit of luck and skill, you can have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">White Balverine</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Minion</a> as a helper.

<ul><li> "Euclid's C-Finder", a thing that looks like a toy raygun and is indeed being used as such by a pair of kids in Freeside. Initially, you never find ammo for it. But once you power up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">ARCHIMEDES II</a>, the little gun becomes the targeting laser for it.
</li><li> The humble Varmint Rifle is the first weapon you get in the tutorial. You get it in poor condition, it suffers from low rate of fire and low clip size and its one good point, high accuracy, is largely useless with just the iron sights. But once it's fully repaired and upgraded, it turns into an extremely light-weight silenced sniper weapon that can take out even late-game enemies with a sneak attack headshot. On top of that, it's cheap to repair and maintain, ammo is plentiful and it can be loaded with AP ammo that'll go through most non-powered armor types without even slowing down in return for a barely noticable 5% reduction in damage. Once you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Ratslayer</a>, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">the Varmint Rifle quickly becomes obsolete</a> and serves as a repair item for its aforementioned unique variant and other weapons of similar build if you do invest in the Jury Rigging perk.
</li><li> The Laser Rifle may possibly qualify, while it has low spread, can be found quite early (you can find two in Nipton in a rather poor state, and if you're really lucky, one of the diggable graves at the Yangtze Memorial.), and a respectable zoom, the rather low damage and the fact it uses Microfusion Cells doesn't quite allow it to be an amazing weapon out the gate early on, but if you are lucky and/or patient the town of Novac has a merchant that sells all three modifications for it, a scope that puts the zoom on par with that of the Gauss Rifle, Focus Optics, that give it +3 to damage, and finally a beam splitter that turns the one beam into three that can hit the same spot all at once, turning it into a weapon capable of carrying you through all of the game, save the Dead Money Add-On.
</li><li> In terms of character build, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowDownTheBomblet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowDownTheBomblet">explosives-based</a> character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">most definitely this</a>. To wit: the best explosives-based weapon you can get at the beginning of the game is a single-shot grenade launcher reminiscent of the M79. Used carelessly, you will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">blow yourself to bits</a>, and its high damage and range is offset by the fact that you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">only get twenty shots for it</a>. Oh, and you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">buy the DLC in order to even have it in the first place</a>.

</li><li> Unarmed is pretty similarly powerful. In the early game, your bare fists are about as pitiful as you'd expect, most enemies fight in melee, and the only real choice to enhance it is boxing gloves that aren't capable of killing an opponent. Once your Unarmed skill hits a certain point, you pick up the various Unarmed moves and perks, and you pick up weapons like the Ballistic Fist, it becomes both highly damaging and highly versatile.

<ul><li> The Monk character class. Most players avoid it because it doesn't exactly sound exciting - he can't wear any armor, and can barely use weapons. As expected, his initial attacks pale in comparison to those of sword-wielding warriors; however, level a monk enough and he becomes one of the strongest attackers in the game, hitting harder than most magic swords several times per round, and having ridiculous spell resistance above almost all items in the game, with great saves for anything that gets through.
</li><li> In the expansion packs, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Shifters</a>. Their physical stats don't matter when they're shapeshifted, so you're pretty much encouraged to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minmaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minmaxing">Minmax</a> and up their Wisdom scores. The problem, unfortunately, is that they need to take 5 levels of the mostly-useless Druid to get them, and their forms are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">quick-moving but painfully frail</a> until they reach level 7, for a combined level of 12 to turn a physically weak, magically inept character into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> Fighter-wannabe in a game that you're expected to beat around level 15. In multiplayer and the expansions, though, you can get characters up to level 40, and past the "epic" level of 20 you can start learning to boost a character's base stats. If you got them a base wisdom of 16 or higher, and you invested every point gained from levelling up into wisdom, and for every point below a base 20 wisdom you used an epic feat to boost wisdom, then at the level cap you could get the ultimate feat for the class: turning into a dragon.
</li><li> The Bard class. While they manage to avoid being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">Spoony Bard</a> at the beginning, they're not particularly amazing. As they level up, though, they gain stronger and stronger songs like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff">Curse Song</a> (which affects multiple enemies at once), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Legionnare's March</a> (which affects your entire party), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Hymn of Requiem</a> (which damages multiple enemies while healing your entire party). While they aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> status, a properly-levelled Bard can be the best support character in the game.

By the second-last level it is bar none the worst weapon in the game. Leveling it up one last time makes it one of the best. This is made more frustrating since the means of leveling up the dagger is by using it to deal ever higher amounts of damage. To get it to the final level, you have to deal nearly 2000 damage with a weapon that has severe accuracy and damage penalties.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, one of the spells you receive for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unlocking and interpreting the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon</span> is "Missile of Patience," which fires a single bolt of energy that does a negligible amount of damage. Until your mage reaches level 11, that is. Then it summons a giant repeating ballista that fires many bolts of (more powerful) energy at as many targets as you can hit before the spell ends. Of course, given the prerequisites necessary to unlock this spell, it's entirely possible that The Nameless One will already be above 11th level by the time he gets access to it.
</li><li> Some versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em> has a quirky variation in the Shepherd class. The class itself (which has marginally better weapon and armor selection than the mage, no magic, and poor trap disarming ability) never really gets better, and to top it off you start off at a lower level and outside a demon-infested ruin instead of a city you could actually buy food in... but mastering the powers of the Avatar lifts restrictions on you regardless of class, like allowing you to equip anything or cast any spell, and due to how the party system is set up the <em>party</em> ends up overall stronger (you can't recruit the companion of your own class, and have to bring all recruitable companions with you at the end of the game, so you, who eventually can bypass the restrictions, being the Shepherd makes for better synergy).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> has two examples:
<ul><li> The Monk/Master is not that good at first, with only access to insanely weak knuckles/nunchaku and cloth for equipment. But his attack and defense go up so fast with levels that you can drop the armor and weapons early on. By mid-game, he dodges more than the Ninja and outdamages everyone else to the point of one-shotting the final boss. Plus, you don't need any equipment for him to be good.
</li><li> In the earlier versions, the Thief starts out as by far the worst of the Light Warriors, with terrible starting stats, his only worthwhile stat being Luck (the stat which is supposed to determine likelihood of running away - but due to a glitch, it does <strong>nothing</strong>). He has surprisingly good Strength growth, but with bad weapons and armor, he's still going to get outdamaged by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Red Mage</a>. Then he gets upgraded into a Ninja, and suddenly, his equip range skyrockets to be on par with the Knight, with better Evasion on top of that, and he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">able to use</a> low-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>, including FAST to make himself even stronger. He even gets the third-strongest sword in the game to himself. In later remakes it's downplayed, with the Thief having slightly lower stats than a Warrior and the Ninja being a few shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> more than the Knight.
</li></ul></li><li> Gordon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> joins with the worst HP of any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>, easily starting off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> compared to your party members at that point. But he starts with 22 in all of his stats and Level 2 in all weapon skills, which lets him take any role you wish and catch up on HP/MP quickly.
</li><li> In the Famicom version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, you start with the Onion Knight job; in the DS version, it's unlocked after a simple sidequest <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25e271');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25e271" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25e271');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">that is itself unlocked through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Socialization Bonus</a>, but let's not pick nits</span>. It's just about useless compared to all other classes, with pathetic stats; the DS version is able to equip everything in the game, but that's not helpful when your stats are that bad. Except, its stats skyrocket after Level 90, and it's the only class allowed to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Onion equipment set</a>.

<ul><li> Played with when Cecil becomes a Paladin about a third of the way through the game; his level is reset to 1, along with all of his stats except for his HP. This means that all his physical attacks are essentially useless until you get him leveled up again, which fortunately isn't <em>too</em> tricky given that the enemies you face at this point in the game will award decent EXP, but it leaves you battling said enemies with a trio of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizards</a>.
</li><li> The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard">Quirky Bard</a> Edward from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> gets outright <em>explosive</em> stat growth past level 70, unlike every other character's stat growth which becomes random and can even go <em>down</em> on a level-up. Get some better equipment for Edward and he becomes the fastest character in the game; level him to around 90-99 and almost all of his stats max out.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">port</a>, the harp you can find in the Cave of Trials deals extra damage against dragons - which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">final dungeon</a> happens to be full of. And the harp in that port's post-game dungeon has a damage boost against <em>every enemy type.</em> His only drawback is auto-hiding in critical health, which spoils your healing rhythm, but prevents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>.
</li><li> He's at it again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears">The After Years</a></em> - in his tale, he's mainly useful because the rest of his party and the enemies are really low-leveled. Unless you take your sweet time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">grinding him</a>, he'll start the endgame a good 10-20 levels below everyone else, and even if he's on par, he'll likely still have weak attack power and low HP. If you stick with him into the final dungeon, he becomes faster than enemies can handle and gets a harp with bonus damage against every enemy type. By now you'll likely have enough cash to buy a ton of X-Potions to buff his Salve, his Bardsong allows for free buffs and debuffs, and his Escape move lets him avoid any attack.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's Freelancer and Mime classes are rather unimpressive on their own, but 'absorb' a mastered class's passive abilities and stat boosts, with the result that by the endgame, they're easily the best classes, since you can have a character with the highest boosts in every stat, using any equipment, and any combination of active abilities you want.
</li><li> The Blue Mage was first introduced in this game. At first it comes with nothing learned and the only abilities you learn from it just involve being able to cast Blue Magic with other classes, learn Blue Magic with other classes and some middling scan abilities. Even the first handful or two of Blue Magic is meh at best and relies going out of your way to find specific monsters. But if you take the time to learn all the available spells that can be learned? The job can easily devastate enemies like they were nothing with it's level-based spells <em>and at the same time</em> be one of the best healers/support characters, better even than White Mages, the typical healer job.
</li><li> The Red Mage class, normally a Jack-of-all-trades class that's good in the beginning, gradually loses use as you go through the game. However, if you persist with the class, long after one would have abandoned it (its final skill level taking <em>999</em> points), you'll gain access to the absurdly powerful Dualcast ability, letting you cast magic twice per turn. The funny thing is that once you do this you'll never use the actual class again, as it has poor stats and forces you to waste one action slot for red magic spells.
</li><li> The Chicken Knife starts off extremely weak, but becomes stronger with every battle you flee from with no limit on its growth (compare the other choice, the Brave Blade, which caps off high and gets weaker) potentially making it a weapon that can deal 9999 on every attack.
</li><li> The Dancer class doesn't have much to write home about - except for its special equipment, like the Rainbow Dress and Lamia Tiara. Then it's much more likely to land Sword Dance attacks that deal x4 damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gau is seen as a Magikarp by most fans, simply because it takes forever to learn all his rages. (He's quite effective with just three, but which ones you get are up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> and it can take quite a bit of grinding to get the ones you want.) With enough rages, he can absorb all eight elements, hit with any element half the time and a simple physical the rest of the time, or even use the rare Charm status on enemies. If that's not enough, he's one of two characters to use the Snow Muffler, the single best equipment in the game.
</li><li> Strago is a Blue Mage, meaning he has to see the enemies' abilities to learn them. Unfortunately, he's a Blue Mage that you get late in the game, after you're well past the point where you'd normally run into the monsters using the blue magic he can learn. This means he's not a "set him aside, and he'll be good later" type, and more of a "If you want him to be useful, you have to go well out of your way and backtrack to get his abilities."
</li><li> Relm starts with no spells, weak physical attack power, an odd assortment of equipment, and the Sketch command which is useless at best and prone to crash the game at worst (though the latter is mostly worked out in re-releases). Her endgame equipment, on the other hand, is among the best, and her Magic stat is the highest in the game so once you teach her some spells she will quickly surpass your other mages. As for Sketch, it remains useless in most circumstances, but if you don't mind some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse">Loop Hole Abuse</a>, it's the key to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">easily exploitable bug</a> in the original SNES version of the game. It's not until fairly late in the game that you get to the point where it's exploitable rather than game-crashing, but once you find the right enemy group you can reliably fill your inventory with vast numbers of the most powerful equipment in the game.
</li><li> The Cursed Shield hits you with every status effect in the game, including Doom (which can't be blocked by a Ribbon, unlike the other status effects) - but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest">take it into 256 battles without dying</a>, and it becomes the best shield in the game, the Paladin Shield, negating or absorbing all elements of magic and avoiding most physical attacks, as well as teaching you the best <em>spell</em> in the game, Ultima (the only way other than the Ragnarok esper, which, incidentally, requires skipping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>, and by extension the ability to bet it at the Colisseum for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">even better sword</a>, unless you're playing the GBA/mobile version).

<ul><li> The Ultima, Shield and Full Cure materia. All do the same thing when initially equipped. Almost nothing, except muck around with your stats. Get them to their second level, though, and they give you a very powerful attack, a powerful defensive spell and the ability to heal a character and remove all status ailments from them. Nothing to sneeze at.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Enemy Skill</a> starts out with no effects whatsoever, and can't even be leveled up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">If you know what enemies have what skills and how to copy them onto the Materia</a>, it can provide access to most of the game's best spells two discs before those spells will even become available.

</li><li> The Cactuar Guardian Force. Its damage is calculated by the number of tens in its current level x 1000 (e.g. at level 43 it does 4000, at level 68 it does 6000). At level 100, it will do 10,000 damage to all enemies making it the second most powerful GF in the game.

All of them start out with an auto-ability that prevents the holder from gaining experience; you need to find two items to fully power them, at which point they triple the rate at which the wielder's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Overdrive</a> meter increases, increase the damage cap to 99,999, and gives up to a 100% damage boost based on the wielder's current health or mana, in addition to 2 other things that vary between weapons.

</li><li> Lulu's Onion Knight gives her Magic Booster and One MP Cost (the short version is that all of her spells hit 50% harder and only cost two MP). Its damage scales with her mana instead, and since it only costs 2 MP to cast anything (and considering that almost nothing in the game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn">Mana Burn</a> effect), she will hit for around triple the damage she would do without it for next to no mana.

</li><li> Isken's a very good forward, finishing with a perfect 99 in Endurance, letting him break through a lot of defenders, and an 81 in Shooting, the fifth-highest out of anyone.
</li><li> Vuroja ends up the best all-around midfielder with a 99 in Passing, a 75 in Endurance, a 54 in Attack, and a 65 in Block. This makes him a fantastic setup guy on offense since he can break through a couple defenders and pass over the rest of them, and he's a pretty good defender who isn't easily gotten through or around.
</li><li> Kulukan finishes as one of the best defenders with very high Block and Attack stats, each at 64, and a near-perfect 96 in Passing. She'd make a great midfielder if her Endurance weren't mediocre.

This begins to change at level 10, when the job has the ability to optimize either White or Black magic, raising the low D skills to a much more impressive B+ skill.

It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">stated by the developers</a> that Astral Flow is meant to be used against a lot of enemies at once, which is really obvious when the 70 Blood Pacts deal damage that's comparable to it.

<ul><li> Onion Knight works quite similarly to his original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> incarnation. His default attacks are weak and hard to connect with, but as he levels up he gains the ability to chain them into other attacks and becomes highly versatile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Firion</a>. At the start, he has exactly one HP attack (i.e. how you kill things, for those unfamiliar with the battle system): a projectile of medium speed with a charge time. As he levels up though and masters his Bravery attacks he learns the ability to chain them into Double Trouble, and learns the HP attacks Weaponsmaster and Lord of Arms, turning him into a mid-range <em>god</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Gabranth</a>. At the start of the match, he's severely underpowered, with a limited moveset and no HP-damaging attacks. However, upon entering EX Mode, he gains an entirely different moveset with multiple high-damage attacks, arguably becoming the game's strongest character second to Chaos. He is also the only character who can charge their own EX gauge at will.

</li><li> Tyro is notorious for having an out-and-out bad stat spread and only gains usefulness with Books that give support-based Soul Breaks and support Abilities. However, he's the only character to have access to every single Record Sphere, including all Class Spheres and 6★ Ability Spheres. Pump enough Motes into him, and Tyro's stats jump significantly to put him on par with other characters.

Reno and Raijin also have such BSB commands; Raijin's in particular is powered up by his <em>other</em> BSB command, starting at 4 hits up to a maximum of 10. Meanwhile, Maria's own BSB command hits more the higher her Magic stat - at max power, she can inflict Super SB-tier damage at every turn.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">As usual</a>, <em>FFIII</em>'s Onion Knight has <em>terrible</em> stat growth, struggling to reach 1000 HP and 50 in all stats when even the weakest mages at his level have about triple that.

Most lines of planes improve modestly, but two of the lower-end aircraft unlock <em>vastly</em> superior aircraft. The first is the MiG-21 bis, which more or less equivalent to the starter F-5E, except its rocket launchers are arguably worse than the F-5E's unguided bombs. Through heavy use, it unlocks the MIG-21-93, which handles much better, carries QAAMs, and performs at a similar level to the F-14D "Super Tomcat". The second is the F-4E Phantom II, which is a large fighter with poor handling and a unique weak and hard to use SP weapon in its napalm bombs. The F-4E unlocks the F-4G Wild Weasel, which handles even worse, but at least has a decent SP weapon in its unique LAGM anti-surface missiles. However, this, in turn, unlocks the F-4X, which remedies pretty much all of the performance issues of the earlier F-4 series and flies similarly to an F-15C or SU-27 with a better SP weapon. Other aircraft trees also get better with newer variants, some even substantially so, such as F-15C -&gt; F-15 MTD/ACTIVE or SU-27 -&gt; SU-35 -&gt; SU-37, but few increase in performance so dramatically.

In the early game, the Cursor is little more than wasted cash, with a pitiful 0.1 cookies per second, and the Grandma is a bit better at 0.5 but stops being useful after the farm. However, both of them get upgrades. Lots and lots of upgrades. Most other buildings get six upgrades - one increases base CPS, the other five double it until it's 32x its increased amount. Cursors start out with that... and then they get upgrades that let them boost their CPS by a number times every other building, which quickly stacks up to a massive amount. Meanwhile, grandmas start with the six standard upgrades... and then get access to nine of their own, making them one of the most powerful buildings in the game. And that's before you get into the boost added by portals, or the Bingo Center.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> virtual pets, the amount of care taken in raising your pet determines its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">evolutionary path</a>, with bad caretaking resulting them digivolving into the pathetically weak Numemon, a bug-eyed slug-thing who attacks by throwing its own excrement. However, raising <em>Numemon</em> with perfect care will result in it Digivolving into Monzaemon, a giant teddybear who is capable of defeating any other Digimon with extreme ease.
<ul><li> In the first <em>Digimon World</em> game for the Playstation, you didn't even have to raise Numemon well, just finish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyTime">Toy Mansion</a> to get the Teddy Bear Costume; then you can spam all the Monzaemon you want.
</li><li> Pretty much all the virtual pets had one of these - a worthless Champion/Adult level created by failing every other requirement, that could digivolve into a superlative Ultimate/Perfect if you played your cards right. The other versions had Vegimon to Vademon, Scumon/Sukamon to Etemon, Nanimon to Digitamamon, and Raremon to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExTyrannomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExTyrannomon">Ex Tyrannomon</a>.

However, midway through the game he could be transformed into a hermit - the most powerful character in the game.
</li><li> The PSP game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMaker">Dungeon Maker</a> 2</em> provides you with a pet who can change into a number of different monsters if you have their "memory." The memories for stronger monsters are found later in the game, but they all start at Level 1 (which is no more powerful than it sounds). This effectively makes all forms other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">Human Ally</a> a Magikarp, and also gives Magikarp Powers to players willing to level up a number of them just to learn their transferable abilities.

It's a strategic pick in multiplayer, however, because it's the only fighter that can carry the Helios antimatter torpedo. Most bombers can't even equip that weapon, which is capable of destroying a cruiser in one shot. The ability to carry this warhead is generally agreed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">unintentional</a> on the part of the developers.

If you get attacked by whatever monster is currently stalking you at the time, you die, unless you have a partner, in which case they take the hit for you and die in your stead. You can then get one of the others if you're in the right place at the right time. The first partner you get has no weapon but can sense the location of the monster on your map, while the other three cannot; however, they do have weapons (with limited ammo, of course) that can stun the monster long enough for you to get away, but not kill it. If you keep the first partner (a teenage schoolgirl named Naomi) all the way through the end of the game, in the final areas of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has a random chance to say, if you spam the "talk to partner" button while the monster is approaching, "I wish... I wish you were DEAD!", which stuns the monster just like an attack from one of the other partners would, and can be used an endless number of times</span>.

Not all ships have them, and those who have them either get them at a fairly high level or needs a rare item named Blueprints (and some ships <em>require both of those</em>). Once they attain that upgrade however, they get a myriad of advantages which makes the game easier for the players.

While her scouting abilities are always useful, the problem is that as soon as Snake is spotted, she'll almost immediately snipe the foe that saw him. This may sound useful, but the player is generally encouraged to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">non-lethal force</a> against enemies (both to get bonus points and to send the enemies to join the Diamond Dogs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">PMC</a>). In many cases where Quiet will snipe a guard, the player would have ample time to non-lethally dispatch the guard before they could call for support. In addition, Quiet's rifle is unsilenced - as soon as she fires, guards will enter alert and go off their standard patrol routes. As missions are performed with her and Quiet and Snake's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">bond</a> grows, the player can attach silencers to her rifles, trade off the lethal ammunition for tranquilizer rounds, or equip a sniper rifle capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">punching through helmets</a>.
<ul><li> Additionally, as bond levels increase, the player can use new commands that make Quiet even more effective. "Cover me" can be used to make Quiet begin firing on enemies independently of the player, "Take aim" can be used to make quiet keep her focus on one enemy and firing when Snake fires (allowing the player to take out two guards at once), and "Shoot this" allows the player to essentially put grenades around corners or into helicopters.
</li></ul></li><li> In MOBA (Massive Online Battle Arena) games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth">Heroes of Newerth</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> you have champions that are very frail and vulnerable in the early game, but have incredible endgame power because they scale really well with levels and items. These are generally known as "carries", as in "they carry the team to victory". If the enemy team does not stop them from progressing to this stage, carries can win 1v2, 1v3, and sometimes even 1v5 fights. Competent carries will play defensively, hold back from attacking the enemy champion, and focus only on defending their tower while killing enemy minions for gold in order to buy the items and acquire the experience they require to scale into late game.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> has officially shied away from the "carry" term, feeling it unfair to put the burden of winning the game on a single player. The term, however, is still used among players for characters that tend to be very strong in late game, with "hyper-carries" being the most extreme examples. Examples of characters with scaling mechanics built into their core kit include:
<ul><li> Tristana begins the game with one of the worst basic attack ranges for a ranged marksman. Her passive increases her range as she levels up, ending with one of the <em>best</em>. Not quite the same case after her rework, where her passive range increase was nerfed and so has her attack speed, though she still remains one of the stronger marksmen at the latter stages.
</li><li> Vayne starts out with nothing but a short-ranged basic attack that deals very little damage when she's still starting out, and her defense is so frail she can lose half her entire health with just a few blows. However, she has so much damage crammed into her ability kit (to begin with: <em>percent-based unblockable damage</em>), she ends up becoming an incredible damage powerhouse in late game.
</li><li> Kog'Maw <em>fits this troop to a T</em>. Short range, no mobility and low base damages, any character can basically <em>kill him with a sneeze</em> during the first 15 to 20 minutes in the game. Kog needs to get levels in order to empower his Bio-Arcane Barrage, his primary offensive tool which increases the range of his basic attacks and grants him percentage health damage <em>per hit</em>. Also his ultimate, Living Artilery is a long range skillshot with an execute threshold that increases in range with each rank. Once acquiring a few items and levels, his lategame becomes <strong>SO</strong>. <strong>FREAKIN</strong>. <strong>NIGHTMARISH</strong>. that high level players and teams developed <em>entire team compositions</em> based around Kog as the sole damage dealer with everyone else supporting him via buffs, shields and heals of all manners.
</li><li> Kayn starts the game with a fairly mediocre ability set, and lacks any passive bonus, instead having a special bar that charges by damaging enemy champions. Once the bar has been filled, he can transform into the <em>Shadow Assassin</em> or <em>Darkin</em> form, augmenting three abilities each (including his ultimate) and granting a powerful new passive bonus.
</li><li> Nasus <em>permanently</em> increases the damage of his Siphoning Strike attack every time he kills a unit with it, with no damage cap. Leave Nasus alone and his Siphoning Strike will eventually hit with the force of a nuke.
</li><li> Veigar <em>permanently</em> gains Ability Power every time he kills a unit with his Baleful Strike or hits and enemy champion with any ability (with a larger bonus for kills/assists), again with no cap.
</li><li> Variation with Ornn: he starts as a fairly weak laner who is easy to bully and tends to burn mana fairly quickly, and he rarely builds offensive power at <em>all</em>, but his passive really comes into its own at levels 13 and above. Said passive allows him to freely upgrade two of his own items, and hand out one item upgrade per level to another party member as well. Some of Ornn's item upgrades include stat improvements equivalent to entire other items - especially with the ones focused on tanking, which tend to get upwards of 1500 gold in stat boosts for <em>free</em>. This tends to make the already durable Ornn a <em>ridiculously</em> resilient tank who can be showing up with 200-300 in both his defensive stats and 4000-5000 HP, ready to lay down a torrent of CC, while also letting him hand out, for example, a free Needlessly Large Rod to anyone with a Rabadon's Deathcap or a thousand gold worth of bonus attack damage to a champion like Vayne or Jhin who first-buys an Infinity Edge, meaning that a late-game Ornn tends to have given every other member of the team a noticeable power boost while being able to take entire teamfights to the face without flinching.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to champions, there are items which becomes stronger as the game drags on.
<ul><li> Sword of the Occult and Mejai's Soulstealer are both stacking items that grant additional attack power and ability power (respectively) each time you kill another champion. They begin as two of the least cost-efficient items in the game (read: horrendously expensive for the bonus you receive), but at maximum stacks provide the highest raw attack power of any item.
</li><li> Rod Of The Ages gives additional bonus HP and MP every minute after it's bought; In other words, the HP and MP boost it provides increases with time.
</li><li> Tear of the Goddess grants additional maximum mana every time an ability is used or mana is spent. Its two build items grant bonus Attack Damage or Ability Power based on the total maximum mana the champion has.
</li><li> The support-focused items like Steel Shoulderguards and Spellthief's Edge gradually improve during the game, starting as simply ways to pick up some extra gold despite the support's entire job being to give another player an easier time at that, and evolving into impressive ward factories with better stat bonuses, allowing the support to keep map control while also being able to run around with the Oracle Lens.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Shujinko, the "deceived" hinted at in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></em>'s title, has a whole story mode to unlock him. Once you've done that, you have to go through the realms to get his other moves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">without anyone to give you hints</a>. But these moves are the best moves from the other fighters, so it works out well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>: The Peasant Woman unit can only be recruited if they are rescued from another army's prisoners, they're abysmal fighters, and all they have on them are puny little daggers. Their chances of surviving battles are slim. However, if they grow in experience, they can end up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Sword Sisters</a>. Sword Sisters are adept at combat and equipped with good swords, heavy crossbows and plate armor. They're on par with Mercenary Captains. Girl power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> does this not with a unit but a terrain type. At the start of the game xenofungus is a useless nuisance that yields no resources for most factions (Gaians get a bonus nutrient and start with one of the Centauri techs), obstructs movement, and allows mind worms to spawn. Researching the "Centauri ___" line of technologies gives improvements to the resource yield up to the same as monoliths by endgame. The Xenoempathy Dome secret project means all fungus is treated as roads, allowing for very fast travel, the Pholus Mutagen grants impressive bonuses for fighting in fungus squares, and the Manifold Nexus boosts resource yield (with sufficient planet rating) past almost any other terrain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SolForge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SolForge">Sol Forge</a></em> has several cards which start out extremely weak at level 1 but become incredibly powerful at level 3. Chrogias, Scorchmane Dragon, and Scrapforge Titan are examples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: Summoner builds. Most of their best items are gotten late hardmode, and their early game armor tends to have paper thin defense. Unless you feel like farming for the rarest item in the game, they don't even get their first summon until <em>after</em> beating the Queen Bee. Once they do get going though, they're quite a force to be reckoned with, with their summons being able to easily tear through most bosses and invasions with little effort.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu">Touken Ranbu</a></em> has Iwatooshi of the Naginata class, who starts out so pitifully weak that even at level 25 he does next to no damage. However, he happens to have the best attack range of any sword in the game: <strong>the entire enemy team</strong>. Level him up enough and max out his stats and he'll eventually be capable of taking down all enemies in one swing, making clearing maps <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/BSiWpG_1SW8?t=18s">a breeze<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sora">sora</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">Nath</a>, the boss of stage 5 and playable character in <em>Acceleration of Suguri 2</em>. She begins at Level 1, but has a special ability called "Extension", which allows her to upgrade one level, and with each one she gets stronger attacks; she's able to upgrade up to Level 3.
</li><li> Speaking of Nath, she also appears as a DLC character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice">100% Orange Juice!</a></em>. She begins with negligible combat stats (-1 ATK, -1 DEF and +1 EVA), however, when she uses a battle card, she stores one stack of "Active Extension", which gives her +1 ATK and DEF, at the cost of -1 EVA, and can store up to 3 stacks of this special ability; and her Hyper, called "Another Ultimate Weapon", gives her +1 ATK and DEF, +1 additional ATK and DEF for every 20 stars spent in this card, meaning she can rack up her attack to a maximum of +9, and demolish anything the game has to offer.
<ul><li> Then there's also QP (Dangerous), who at first seems like a slightly worse version of regular QP, (Having -1 EVA), however, she gets combat bonuses just by holding cards with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Pudding</a>" in their name, and her Hyper allows her to get these cards from the center of the deck.

The most prominent of this is the "Hawk Eyes" skill where it extends vision and grants night vision to the user; unfortunately, there are much better skills out there compared to this. However, thanks to an insight from his friend, Yun figures out that Hawk Eyes allows him to target anybody from a long range with ease.

The most infamous example in-universe is "Appraisal" which at level 1 only rewards basic info like "wall" or "deer" while causing a massive headache with each use. Most people decide not to learn it as a result despite it being able to supply massively valuable information at higher levels.
<ul><li> Taratects are incredibly weak right after hatching, having only an F-ranking. With time they can potentially evolve in the S-rank Arch Taratect, to say nothing of the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Queen Taratects</a>.
</li><li> It's revealed that Kumoko stumbled into a Magikarp Power path by accident. Upon choosing her evolution, she went into the Zoa Ele family of spiders, which has a skill that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">corrodes and destroys anything it touches.</a> However, the Zoa Ele lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> to resist corrosion, so any attempt to use that attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">will kill the spider in the process.</a> It's only through a lucky chance (Kumoko ate a few creatures with low-level corrosion skills and inadvertently built up a resistance) that Kumoko <em>only</em> loses a few legs whenever she uses the move. Sticking further with the line causes the evolution into Ede Saine, which can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Evil Eye</a> skills... but again, the Ede Saine has no native resistance to its Evil Eye, which means that firing off Evil Eye attacks will render it blind (it may be a spider, but that's still only eight shots max). Essentially, the evolutionary line is designed to die... but stick with Ede Saine, and the final evolution kicks in. The Zana Horowa spider, as it turns out, gains the skill <em>Immortality</em>. It's explicitly noted that Zoa Ele die so fast that Kumoko was the first creature <em>ever</em> to become a Zana Horowa.

<ul><li> Two of the main characters, Nami and Usopp. In the early series, they were nothing more than normal humans, with Nami showing skill in using a bo staff and Usopp as a crackshot with a slingshot, but that was about it. As the series progressed, however, they each invented new ways of fighting (Nami using one of Usopp's inventions to manipulate the weather, and Usopp inventing new ways to attack the enemy from a distance and further improving his unbelievable aim), and are now as superhuman as the rest of their pirate crew, with Nami able to hold her own against some of the most dangerous pirates on the sea and Usopp being labelled as a <em>god</em> amongst men for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">his actions</a> in the Dressrosa Arc. They're still the physically weakest of the main cast, but they've come a very long way from where they were through developing their unique skills and owning the niche they found within the crew.
</li><li> Devil Fruits, particularly the weird ones, can lend themselves to this kind of progression. They don't get stronger; their user just gets more creative and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">learns what they can actually do</a>. Users can become extremely powerful as they go through the learning curve, even if they started low; Brook wasn't exactly a pushover, but his power remained seemingly useless until he figured out how much he could control his own soul and that of others, and Trafalgar Law couldn't cash in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> ticket for a long time and remained weak until he could actually learn enough medical skills to put his Op-Op fruit to good use and get some practice on top of that.
</li><li> Sanji, at least in comparison to his siblings. His siblings were born outright superhuman, doing things like jumping off balconies onto stone floors without any damage, whereas Sanji was an ordinary child. Over the years, Sanji fought increasingly powerful enemies while his family stayed in the North Blue. By their reunion roughly a decade later, Sanji is far stronger than his siblings and a considerable threat in the New World whereas they all get easily manhandled by Big Mom's children.
</li></ul></li><li> Kanchomé of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em> has a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a> and Magikarp Power. His first three spells, which are shapeshifting without any increase in power, shrinking, and illusionary growing, are nearly useless for normal combat, but he still manages to win several battles or help others win battles by using them for tricking opponents. His first powerful spell allows him to make super strong copies of himself. His next spell creates the illusion that the opponent's spell has failed in order to trick them into cancelling it. His next spell after that creates the illusion of copying the opponent's spell, but is able to inflict real injuries if they are fooled. His ultimate spell allows him to trap an opponent in an illusion world that is impossible to escape from even if they know it is an illusion. So he start as out as one of the weakest momodos but by the end of the series he is one of the strongest.

Initially, they are basic weapons that give basic boosts to their users. When upgraded (whether by adding materials, copying similar weapons or just training with them) they boost the wielders' abilities to demigod levels and give multiple abilities that allow them to become more powerful.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Shirogane is this trope, much to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">secret shame</a>. He is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckinessIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckinessIsPainful">impossibly</a></em> bad at pretty much everything when he first tries it, but if he keeps trying he can go further in those skills than almost anyone. And it might be said that his gift <em>is</em> to try, as often as it takes, without getting bored or giving up. The crux of any training chapter involving him is not whether he will learn a skill (that's a foregone conclusion) but whether he will be able to persuade Fujiwara to teach him in the first place, after the physical pain that all the previous times caused her.
<ul><li> Hayasaka theorizes that Shirogane's effort may have results better than those of talented people, in the same way that handmade goods can be more valuable than mass-produced ones. Perceiving the effort and emotion that must have gone into such a result, when his starting point was so low, is inspirational in itself.

She's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">Instant Expert</a> in almost everything, but her psyche is so fractured that when she does need to learn things, she gets easily discouraged or distracted by internal strife. Learning thus takes longer than it 'should', considering her prodigious intelligence, and Shirogane has outwitted her several times just because he's able to stay focused on a goal.

</li><li> There are numerous examples in the Shogi (Japanese chess) family. In Tenjiku Shogi, there's the Drunken Elephant, which can promote into, essentially, <em>a second king</em>, allowing you to survive your first king's death, and the Water Buffalo, which promotes into a Fire Demon, insanely useful because of its ability that allows it to capture a <em>ton</em> of enemy pieces in one move. There's also the Deva in Tai Shogi, which can only move one space in <em>certain</em> directions, but promotes into the Teaching King, which, depending on how you interpret the rules, can move as a Free King (a chess Queen) <em>and</em> with 3-step Lion power. (Lion power normally allows a piece to make two separate one-step moves, each counting as a move in its own right, in one turn. In this case, three.) Pawns don't get a lot of love though.

The infamous Truenamer class also gets Gate at level 20, but the class was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">badly-written</a> that it takes a dedicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> to even keep it alive until level 20.
</li><li> The Samurai class from Complete Warrior is an unintentional example. Its strongest feature is the Samurai code of conduct, which makes you lose all your abilities if you break it ... because the class is so weak that losing it actually makes you more powerful! Specifically, breaking this code of conduct when higher than level 11 allows you to switch 10 class levels to the far-superior Ronin class. To a lesser extent, the class's best <em>intentional</em> features are considered to be Mass Staredown and Improved Staredown, which come online at 10 and 14 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">allow it to force enemies to flee en masse</a>. Up to that point, though, you're basically a very small step above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">the Warrior.</a>
</li><li> The Bard in First Edition required that you dual-class three times, and given how complicated dual-classing was then (each dual-classing would restart you at first-level), this was no mean feat. However, upon taking your first level, you then gained all your old fighter skills, all your old thief skills, druid casting, music that boosted allies and automatically charmed enemies, lore powers, and magic item-based powers. And you've got 23 levels to go...
<ul><li> The Fochlucan Lyrist, a prestige class in 3.5, was an attempt to update the original Bard's Magikarp Power. The easiest way to join was to take four levels in Bard, four levels in Druid, and two in Rogue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">a horribly disorganized build</a>. However, the Fochlucan Lyrist advanced arcane casting, divine casting, and bardic music, and received six skill points and a warrior's Base Attack. Unfortunately, the build it worked off of was so hideously weak that even such a powerful class could do little more than damage control; at full advancement, the Lyrist's main components would both be six levels behind.
</li></ul></li><li> The shadowcaster of <em>Tome of Magic</em> seems designed for this.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31pax8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31pax8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31pax8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> — the class' designer — is that it was actually just not properly playtested. Considering one of the other classes in the book was the truenamer, the shadowcaster got off lightly.</span> At low levels, you're an Apprentice shadowcaster, with the inflexibility and low spells per day of a wizard combined with the limited pool of spells of a sorcerer - you learn one Mystery per level, and can cast each one only once per day, essentially giving you six castings per day at 6th level. However, when you reach 7th level, you become an Initiate shadowcaster, causing all the Mysteries you learned as an Apprentice to upgrade, doubling in uses per day and becoming more versatile spell-like abilities, jumping you from six castings to thirteen castings. Take it all the way to 13th, and you become a Master Shadowcaster, causing the same thing to happen to all the Mysteries as an Initiate... and moreover, increasing the power of your Apprentice mysteries to be three-use-per-day supernatural abilities. Now the shadowcaster has an impressive thirty-one castings per day, ensuring that they'll almost never run out of their Mysteries... and it's around this point that many shadowcasters realize that their Mysteries are actually pretty dang powerful. Some guides point out the Caul of Shadows fundamental (cantrip-equivalent) as this — it grants a decent buff to AC, but its short duration and only being usable three times a day keeps a lot of potential from it... but at level 14, fundamentals become usable at will, allowing Shadowcasters to keep it up more-or-less constantly.
</li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">"theurge"-type</a> prestige classes in 3.5 are like this. To elaborate; the very nature of such prestige classes mean while you're progressing two kinds of magic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">you're behind on both</a> compared to a single-classed caster. The part where this trope kicks in is that spells only go up to 9th-level, so at a sufficiently high level you get 9ths in <em>both</em> and therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">basically two casters for the price of one.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a number of cards that function like this, starting out average or even worse than average in some cases but becoming very powerful when some condition is met:
<ul><li> The <em>Kamigawa</em> block had a number of "flip cards" which are fairly weak, relatively useless creatures when first summoned, but can be "flipped" (rotated 180 degrees) when certain conditions are met, generally becoming a powerful legendary creature. The conditions required to flip these cards are sometimes quite easy. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=78691">Student of Elements,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for example, becomes Tobita, Master of Winds as soon as it gains flying, a task fairly easily accomplished with blue spells. Others are considerably more difficult to flip, but the results are worth it. For instance, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=78600">Bushi Tenderfoot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> must first contribute to the death of another creature to flip, but as a puny 1/1 it isn't likely to kill much of anything without help, and will surely die if sent into combat without some sort of outside boost or protection. However, if you do manage this feat, that puny Tenderfoot becomes the immensely powerful Kenzo the Hardhearted, who is capable of dishing out a whopping 10 damage to an enemy creature in combat.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note322j9b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note322j9b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note322j9b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To put it into perspective: a normal non-magical human with a sword hits for 1. A grizzly bear hits for 2. A hill giant hits for 3. Most dragons hit for 5 and up. So a creature dealing 10 damage by itself is like two dragons mauling something at once.</span>
</li><li> The <em>Eldrazi</em> set has brought along creatures that gain 'Level Counters' when ever you pay to do so. Their stats increase takes a while and it takes up resources that could be put toward other uses instead, but some of them get REALLY good powers at max level. For example, take <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=198164">Lord of Shatterskull Pass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Leveling it to max requires spending mana on it for <em>6 turns</em>, and the levels between level 1 (which grants +3/+3) and level 6 don't add anything.
</li><li> The <em>Innistrad</em> set introduces double-faced cards and the transform mechanic. Most of them are werewolves but one in particular, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221179">Ludevic's Test Subject,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an egg. It has zero attack power, and is in fact completely unable to attack. However, once you use its ability to give it five "hatch" counters, it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Ludevic's Abomination</a>, a 13/13 creature with trample, which is much better for attacking.
</li><li> The <em>Theros</em> block adds the Heroic mechanic. Heroic creatures gain a special effect when you target them with a spell, usually placing +1/+1 counters on them. It is quite easy to turn a 1/2 <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/ths/en/13.html">Favored Hoplite<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">Juggernaut</a> that simply doesn't take damage and can bulldoze through enemy defenses.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/m11/en/28.html">Serra Ascendant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> starts out as a 1/1 with lifelink. If you manage to get your life total &gt;= 30 (you start with 20) and keep it that high, the Serra Ascendant becomes a 6/6 creature with flying and lifelink. Naturally, Serra Ascendant is a solid addition to any deck that specializes in life gain.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/m13/en/57.html">Jace's Phantasm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is normally a puny 1/1 flyer. It becomes a respectable 5/5 flyer (making it as powerful as the average <em>dragon</em>) if an opponent has ten or more cards in his or her graveyard. Conveniently, a lot of blue cards (especially those related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Jace Beleren</a> like the Phantasm) force players to discard cards.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/roe/en/169.html">Tuktuk the Explorer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> starts out as a measly 1/1 with haste that costs three mana to summon. If he dies, he is replaced by a legendary 5/5 goblin golem artifact creature called "Tuktuk the Returned". Since the opponent probably isn't going to be in any hurry to kill Tuktuk for you, you'll need to find a way to hasten his demise yourself.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253670">Primordial Hydra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> starts out relatively weak, with power and toughness equal to the X value when summoning it, which could conceivably be as low as 1. Every turn, though, it doubles its power and toughness, which, through the power of exponents, can make it unstoppable in, at most, 5 turns, and even less if extra mana is used when summoning it.
</li><li> In a metagame sense, this applies to numerous decks. Multi-color decks have extremely slow early games since most of the lands they rely on for their mana base enter tapped. Then, when they have those lands out, they start casting multi-colored spells, which are usually more powerful than equivalently costed monocolor spells as a balancing effect for their requiring multiple colors of mana. Delve decks, which have underwhelming early games since delve cards are very expensive to hardcast, but once they've spent the early game filling their graveyard, they can start exiling those cards to pay the colorless part of delve spells' costs, letting them cast multiple otherwise expensive spells in a turn.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em>, Chaos and Lizardmen teams in particular depend on this. Instead of blitzers, they start with expensive 'musclemen' units (Saurus and Chaos Warriors) who have high natural stats but no skills (especially the all-important Block), which make them weaker than other factions' blitzers (and Dwarf linemen). Once those musclemen gain one-two levels and gain access to Block and Mighty Blow, they become terrors on the field (especially if your Chaos Warriors pick up a few mutations on the side).
<ul><li> Chaos Pact and Underworld are two teams who depend entirely on this. Their starting players are sub-par and they suffer from expensive rerolls and high player turnover. However, their cheap players and insanely varied skill and mutation access (both have normal access to every skill in the game across their players, with Underworld having a better spread across players while Pact has <em>incredible</em> Marauders) means that a team of level 3+ underworld players are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> team to be feared.

To recap, this would only count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerWithAge">Stronger with Age</a> if it weren't for the fact an ork has to work real hard, and fight a whole lot, to make it in life.</span>

They are the cheapest heroes available to the Human mercenaries warband, and they are the weakest initially. They also have the highest stat growth. A Youngblood who walks and endures the path of trials can easily grow to surpass the mighty Champions and even their own Captains and actually become the heroes they aspire to be.

However, grow its power stat too much, and Stelgar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">destroys itself.</a> On the other hand, play Stelgar in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">minion</a> deck and it changes to gaining mugic counters every time it wins a battle, which, unlike the power stat, can be used up in a productive way, so it becomes a viable muge. Stelgar's second card, <a class="urllink" href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/chaotic/images/e/e6/Stelgar.png.png/revision/latest?cb=20100219212100">Stelgar, Vicious Mutation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> starts with the water element, which is unusual for Underworlders, and 20 in every stat. However it gains 10 in <em>everything</em> at the end of each turn. Protect Stelgar long enough and it will grow into a massive creature with over 100 in <em>every stat.</em> Then equip some element gaining battlegear on to it.

<ul><li> Some heroes, such as Argent Adept, Akash'Thriya, Absolute Zero, and Benchmark, have an extremely long build-up but enormous power when they get close to the ceiling. Benchmark, for example, takes at least nine plays just to get all his gear out, to say nothing of his Software Ongoings, but when he gets going he can deal a ton of damage reliably every turn. These heroes tend to do well when paired with a character like Omnitron-X, Freedom Five Bunker, or Freedom Five Legacy, who will allow them to play cards out of sequence.
</li><li> Bugbear in team mode is always a <em>threat</em>, but the more incapacitations happen, the more damage he deals.
</li><li> In the OblivAeon mode, Wager Master's challenge gives you a mediocre reward that provides a small amount of healing every turn. <em>But</em>: if you don't have anyone to heal - not necessarily an easy challenge in an apocalyptic damage-fest - it can instantly complete any other Challenge in the game and save you a ton of time, cards and/or other inconveniences.

<ul><li> This show's incarnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow">Lord Tirek</a> portrays him in this way. As a result of over a thousand years of imprisonment, Tirek starts out emaciated and weak, forced to sulk in dark alleyways and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaDrain">Mana Drain</a> any straggling unicorns. Over the course of two episodes, however, he drains enough magic to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> (in addition to gaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">massive, muscular form</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep">deep, booming voice)</a>. Tirek had to trick a more powerful being into helping him by pretending to be a friend and kindred spirit, right up until the point where Tirek was strong enough to drain <em>him</em>.
</li><li> Spike from the same show is in the same boat, with some episodes treating him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> and the poor guy struggling with feelings of uselessness in the face of his more-powerful friends. Catch is, Spike is a baby dragon, so the show is pretty clear that his point of being useless is pretty temporary, as the few adult dragons shown have been incredibly powerful. This is shown when his fire breath has gradually become stronger as the series has gone on, going from relatively minor to being able to destroy a gigantic falling mass of ice by himself. After molting, he gains wings and his firebreath becomes strong enough to drive off a Roc.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder30');">    Yu-Gi-Oh! </div><div class="folder" id="folder30" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Longtime players may remember Maha Vailo, a Level 4 monster with mediocre stats (1550 ATK/1400 DEF). On its own, it was useless, but its special ability allows it to gain an extra 500 ATK for every equip card given to it. A simple Malevolent Nuzzler or Horn of the Unicorn (both of which provide a 700 ATK boost) now boost Maha's ATK by <em>1200</em>, and the fun doesn't stop there. With the right equips, it could have an ATK over 4000, and easily be strong enough to take out <em>more than half the opponent's life points in a single shot</em>. Bear in mind that this is a game where most high-end monsters have ATK power in the range of 2500-3000. The strongest it can get? Five Monsters out including itself (easy using Scapegoat), three United We Stand, two Mage Power, and Luminous Spark. That would give it 22550 ATK - for comparison, Five-Headed Dragon, the physically strongest Monster out there, has 5000, and starting Life Points is 8000.
</li><li> It now has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> in Morphtronic Videon (1000 ATK/1000 DEF), which gets 800 per equip card when in attack postion. Using the above cards, it can get 23500 ATK.
</li><li> Armed Protector Dragon also gains 500 ATK for each equip card on it and prevent equip cards from being destroyed.
</li><li> For a similar effect that lets you use cards other than equip cards to power it up, and also includes your opponent's cards, you can use Jester Lord, which gains 1000 ATK for every spell and trap card on the field, and it starts off with 0 ATK, making it potentially even stronger than Maha Vailo or Morphtronic Videon. That is up to 10,000 ATK, plus any effects from equip cards if you used them. The downside is that there can't be any other monsters on the field.
</li><li> Armed Samurai - Ben Kei gets an additional attack for every equip card you put on him. With, say, Mage Power and Axe of Despair, he'll hit three times for 2500, very nearly enough to completely oneshot a player. Yes, there have been decks built around disabling your opponents magic and traps for a turn, then summoning this guy with three equip cards and winning the game.
</li><li> Mataza the Zapper - An effect monster card with a pretty dainty 1300 ATK and even worse DEF. The catch? He can attack TWICE during the battle phase. Helloooo equip cards! Plus, he is immune from having his control switched, so you can't use cards like Enemy Controller on him and works effortlessly into any warrior based deck.
</li><li> Similarly, there's the combo with Chimeratech Overdragon, which is a Fusion Monster with ATK equal to 800 times the number of Fusion Materials. This can be combined with a card that lets you discard, from your deck, the Fusion Materials for one monster, and another card that lets you remove from your discard pile the Materials for a Fusion Monster and Summon it. Then you can use a card (Limiter Removal) and double Chimeratech's ATK, possibly leading to something along the lines of a 36000 ATK monster that can attack 20 monsters each turn.
</li><li> Chimeratech Overdragon is not the only monster whose power is determined by how many cards are used to summon it. There also are Chimeratech Fortressdragon, Cyber Eltanin, Megarock Dragon, Evil Dragon Ananta, Worm Zero, Starduston, Kasha, Grandora The Dragon of Destruction, Prometheus King of the Shadows, and more.
</li><li> The LV monsters generally start as something like a LV 3 1000 ATK monster, when conditions (Ranging from as simple as surviving until the next turn to directly attacking your opponents life points) are fulfilled they level up, bringing out the next level, until they reach their final forms, with 2700 ATK or more and powerful effects such as negating all Magic cards or destroying all your opponents monsters by discarding a single card. The highest levels were required to be summoned by effect (mostly) so you could often just skip the lowest stage by playing the middle one first.
</li><li> Batteryman AA is a monster that for every Batteryman AA on the same side of the field, they all gain 1000 ATK each if they are all in ATK position and 1000 DEF each if they are all in DEF position. If you manage to three of them on the field, you can use the spell card Short Circuit to destroy all cards on the opponents side of the field, allowing you to attack the opponent directly and deal 9000 points of damage to kill them in one turn.
</li><li> A number of cards gain ATK for number of cards either in the Graveyard or banished, meaning that long games can turn them into downright absurd powerhouses. The most notorious of this gang is likely Gren Maju Da Eiza, who earned a fair amount of infamy when the late-2010s metagame featured a lot of cards that banished as a cost en masse; a simple Pot of Desires could bring up Gren Maju from 0 ATK to 4000.
</li><li> Another great one is The Calculator, whose ATK is determined by the levels of the monsters on your side of the field. On its own, it only has 600 ATK but with the support of a single high level monster, its attack shoots up to around 3000 or more, and with several high level monsters it can go over 10,000 and beyond. The Fortune Lady cards, Greed Quasar, and Montage Dragon also have ATKs determined by either their own or other monster's levels and can get very powerful.
<ul><li> There also is a similar card called The Calibrator, which gains 300 ATK times the total rank of all monsters on your side of the field. This is much more difficult to get up to the same ridiculous amount of ATK that The Calculator can have since only Xyz monsters have ranks, so it compensates for this by starting with 1500 ATK on its own.
</li></ul></li><li> The Great Moth series is famous for being a bit <em>too</em> Magikarp. First, summon the pathetically weak Petit Moth (a caterpillar with Kuriboh-level stats), then equip it with Cocoon of Evolution, turning it into a somewhat poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>. From then on, you need to keep the Moth protected as long as possible, so you can use it as Tribute once a certain number of turns have passed. Two turns nets you the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">completely useless</a> Larvae Moth, four nets you the respectable (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">for its time</a>) Great Moth, and six bestows upon you the Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, the strongest Insect in the game by ATK. Unfortunately, the sheer difficulty of keeping any Monster alive for six turns, as well as the fact that PUGM is basically a highly vulnerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">beatstick</a>, means that the whole archetype was considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> even when it was new, and time has not been kind to it.
<ul><li> However, this archetype may have become somewhat more useful again with the release of the cards Parasite Paranoid and Super Cocoon of Evolution, which can allow Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth to be summoned a whole lot faster, although they can also be used with other insect monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> A non-monster example was Broken Bamboo Sword. This Equip Spell did <em>absolutely nothing</em> to the monster it was equipped to, and a lot of players wondered what Konami was thinking. Then in the next two sets, they released Golden Bamboo Sword and Soul Absorbing Bamboo Sword, Spell Cards that required Broken Bamboo Sword to use. They don't make Broken Bamboo Sword a particularly great card, but it does make it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a>.
</li><li> There are a lot of cards in the game which exist to boost the powers of low-Level Normal Monsters. One example is Sword of The Soul Eater, which can only be equipped to a level 3 or lower Normal Monster and allows you to boost it's ATK by 1000 for each other Normal Monster you sacrifice when you activate it.
</li><li> Mokey Mokey is a very weak and harmless looking monster, but the card Mokey Mokey Smackdown raises its ATK to 3000, the same as a Blue-Eyes White Dragon.
</li><li> Similar to Mokey Mokey, Skull Servant is a very weak monster, but has several cards that make it devastating when used with it. Skull Servant is one of the oldest cards in the game and its devastating support cards with not released until much later. The game company probably released these cards just to be funny. The main one is King of the Skull Servants, which starts with 0 ATK, but gains 1000 ATK for every Skull Servant, King of the Skull Servants, or any monster whose name is treated as Skull Servant in the grave yard.
</li><li> Winged Kuriboh also is weak by itself but has several devastating cards to support it, including a very powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form, Winged Kuriboh LV 10.
</li><li> Dark Flare Knight is a Fusion Monster that actually has less ATK than one of the monsters needed to summon it, its only advantage in battle is a weak defensive ability. But when it is destroyed, it goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> and becomes the devastating Mirage Knight.
</li><li> Ma'at starts out with 0 ATK but by correctly guessing the top three cards on your deck (there are some cards that let you see what they are), her ATK can increase to up to 3000 and add the cards you correctly guessed to you hand.
</li><li> Yubel has 0 ATK but strong defensive abilities. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> forms, known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Terror Incarnate and The Ultimate Nightmare</a> also have 0 ATK but their abilities very powerful.
</li><li> Satellite Cannon starts with 0 ATK but its ATK increases greatly with each turn and it can't be destroyed by low level monsters, although its ATK goes back to 0 each time it attacks.
</li><li> Unformed Void can gain ATK equal to the total ATK of your opponents Xyz monsters, once per turn, up to three times.
</li><li> Raging Flame Sprite, Mucus Yolk, and Drill Barnicle can attack the opponent directly and gain 1000 ATK each time they do damage. Mucus Yolk is even more this, since it has 0 ATK, meaning it needs an equip to do damage at all.
</li><li> Aitsu and Soitsu are extremely weak but gain high ATK when united with their partners Koitsu and Doitsu respectively, who also are extremely weak on their own.
</li><li> Possibly the most well known example are the Exodia cards. Individually the five main Exodia cards are weak but if you get all five in your hand, you automatically win. If you manage to get all five in your graveyard, you can summon Exodia Necros, which is extremely difficult to kill and gets stronger every turn. There also is another card called Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord, which starts out with 0 ATK but rapidly gets stronger with every attack and can also cause you to automatically win if you use it with with the other Exodia cards. There also is another form called The Legendary Exodia Incarnate which is mechanically almost the opposite of Exodius. It gains 1000 ATK for every piece of Exodia already in the grave, but it returns one to your hand at the end of each turn so it gets weaker, but helps you get all the pieces in your hands, and if it is destroyed while you have pieces of Exodia in your hand, you can draw a card for each one.
</li><li> During the Grand Prix arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> anime, Team Taiyou uses as the absolute ace of their deck a card so common that everyone possesses at least 1 copy of it, but no one bothers using it, due to its extremely hard to fulfill summoning conditions, requiring you to protect a Level 1 Normal Monster for twenty turns. The twist? That common card is literally god-like and unstoppable in case the player is skilled enough to let it hit the field, said in-universe to rival the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Egyptian God Cards</a>. This card's name: Zushin the Sleeping Giant. In the card game, Zushin is nearly impossible to beat once it is summoned. It is immune to card effects, and its ATK is always 1000 more than that of the monster it fights with. Pretty much the only relevant cards that can take it down are Kaijus and Utopia the Lightning... which, unfortunately, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere">run very commonly these days.</a>
</li><li> Thousand Eyes Idol has 0 ATK and DEF and no special ability. However, it can be fused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Relinquished</a> or a fusion substitute monster, to create Thousand Eyes Restrict, which not only has Reliquished's ability to absorb enemy monsters, but also makes all the opponent's monsters unable to attack or change position.
</li><li> The trap card Good Goblin Housekeeping works this way. It lets you draw one card, plus one more for each other copy of the card in the graveyard, then sends one card in your hand back to decks. So the first time you use it, it only lets you replace one card in your hand with another, but the second and third time you use it, it lets you draw more cards, increasing your hand advantage. It can get even crazier if you get three copies of it in the grave, then use a card like Mask of Darkness to get one of them back and use it again.
</li><li> Diabound Kernel starts with only 1800 ATK but gains 600 more every time it attacks.
<ul><li> The anime version of Diabound may be one of the most broken monsters ever. Intead of growing stronger every turn, it had the ability to PERMANENTLY copy the abilities of any monster it defeated and grow more and more monstrous with every victory. And by permanently, I mean it doesnt lose copied powers after the duel ends; Dark Bakura used it to defeat Kaiba's Blue-Eyes in a duel so that it would have Blue-Eyes's power when he later used it in the memory world.
</li></ul></li><li> As a rule, because monsters themselves are the game's main resource, there's a lot of weak monsters that people use because they can be used as materials for bigger, stronger monsters.
