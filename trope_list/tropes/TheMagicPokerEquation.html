<div class="indent">— <strong>Seto Kaiba</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>
</div></div><p>A law of probability which only exists in television and movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">poker</a>, and can be expressed thus:
</p><p></p><dl><dd><dl><dd><div class="indent">L = s * i
</div></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Where L = luck, s = skill and i = importance.
</p><p>It describes the phenomenon in TV poker games whereby the better the poker player, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">the more crucial the hand of poker being played</a>, the better the players' hands are.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In TV, the most talented poker players get threes of a kind, full houses, straights and flushes with remarkable frequency; it would seem that while <em>actual</em> poker savants are masters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">risk management and psychological warfare</a>, <em>fictional</em> poker savants are masters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">getting dealt good cards</a>.
</p><p>But even novice players can get full houses and flushes if the hand in question is an amazing climactic hand on which the plot hinges. When both factors are in play, the values of the hands hit the stratosphere - the best poker player in the world, playing the most important hand of his life, will probably beat a straight flush with a royal flush. In real life, he'd probably just beat two pair with a better two pair.
</p><p>Barring various methods of cheating, poker players have exactly zero control over what cards they get. They can only master reading their opponents, sending false signals, and throwing away crappy hands.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In trading card games, this is referred to as "mising," mise being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> contraction of "might as well have" (drawn some specific obviously gamewinning card), or "topdecking". Of course, it's far more justified in this case than poker and similar games, since a key part of deckbuilding strategy is making sure that there are quite a few cards you can use to get yourself out of any seemingly unwinnable situation.
</p><p><strong>Related TV poker phenomena:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Even in unimportant five card hands with regular players, nobody ever has less than two pair. If the players ever <em>do</em> have just a pair (or lower), it's because a point is being made of how bad/unlucky the player is, how good they are at bluffing, or how lame the game is.
</li><li> In a game of three or more players, almost every hand is quickly whittled down to two players - usually the same two, time and time again. The "unimportant" characters never pick up any good hands.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The more important the hand, the closer together the values. A climactic hand will not be won by a straight flush over two pair; more likely it will be four kings over four queens. When both players have great hands, both are more likely to stay in the hand and bet high. If one goes all-in and loses, it becomes by definition the climactic hand. A hand involving poor cards isn't likely to be the final one unless growing blinds force the players to play anything.
</li><li> Three of a kind/four of a kind is the only time it will come down to the value of the individual cards, except for the "royal flush beats straight flush" cliché. You never see a full house with queens showing beating a full house with nines showing, or a jack-high flush beating a nine-high flush.
</li><li> The person who puts their cards down first loses. Especially if they've got such a good hand they don't even wait to see the other person's cards before they start cackling and raking in their winnings. (See also: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin">Assumed Win</a>) Very often you see the players showing their hands in ascending strength, like player A two pair, player B three of a kind, player C full house, player D takes the pot with with four of a kind. Exception: the person puts their cards down and the other player concedes defeat without showing their own cards - because they're throwing the game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fg2i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fg2i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fg2i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In real life poker, the hands actually <em>shown</em> are likely to be ascending in strength—because if a player's hand isn't good enough to beat all the hands seen so far, they'll say something like "beats me" without showing the hand. Showing your hand gives information to the other players about how you play, like telling them whether you were bluffing, so a good player doesn't actually do it if they don't have to. But in fiction, you're likely to see all the remaining players show their hands, each stronger than the last.</span>
</li><li> The amateur can often be seen beating "veterans" of the game. (Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestedAtBowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestedAtBowling">Bested at Bowling</a>.) It's true that there is a factor of luck involved in poker, but it's not enough to make up for lack of skill.
</li><li> Expert poker players who must be defeated by the hero always have a 'tell' (i.e. a subconscious move they make when they are bluffing, or have a good hand). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">Rule of Perception</a> is that any plot-important tell has to be clear and visible so the audience can see it, but it often ends up so obvious that viewers are left wondering how the person in question got to be such an expert. Seems to happen more in drama than in comedy.
</li><li> Poker in fiction is typically played for open stakes, meaning that when the hero's four-of-a-kind is up against the villain's straight flush, the hero will end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">borrowing vast amounts of money to bet with</a>, being forced to come up with a wacky scheme to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts">repay the resulting debt</a>. In real life, poker is always played for table stakes: you can only bet with the money you have at the table, and may only bring more to the table between hands.
</li><li> In the pivotal hand, at least one of the poker players will announce a raise as follows: "I see your bet..." (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticPause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticPause">Dramatic Pause</a>) "...and raise you." While fairly commonplace and tolerated in many informal home games, this sort of action is called a "String Bet" and the intended raise would not stand at any respectable casino (the action is over once the player announces their intent to call, to prevent players from calling, and then waiting to see if other players' reactions suggest raising would also be a good idea).
</li><li> Similarly, the winner will take an inordinate amount of time to reveal the winning hand in order to build up suspense. While this does happen, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> it's called "slow rolling" and is very poor sportsmanship, since it slows down the game for everyone, even those not involved in the hand who just want to get on to the next one. Doing it habitually will get you kicked out of casinos.
</li><li> In the past, the game in question will usually be "Five Card Draw." This probably has to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoCalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoCalization">the fact that it was the only legal form of poker in California for many years.</a> It was supplanted by stud and community card variants in most other places before the end of the 19th century. The explosion in popularity of televised poker tournaments seems to have changed the preference to Texas Hold-Em.
</li><li> The concept of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_odds">pot odds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is almost non-existent in fiction, leading to players staying in the pot with very weak hands and catching their miracle card and win it all. This is often celebrated as a great play or the showcase of the true skill of the player, but in reality this is just pure dumb luck and a very safe way to go broke sooner than later. Also in draw poker, exchanging cards will often improve hands to a ridiculous degree, like having a small pair, exchanging three cards and picking up a strong full house or having nothing, taking four cards and improving to a straight flush.
</li><li> When the hero ever runs a bluff, it will almost never be a semi-bluff and often happens in a spot where bluffing makes no sense. Also, the opponents will often fold ridiculously strong hands to it, like full houses or even quads, while in reality this happens very rarely and calling with hands of such strength is almost never a mistake <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1o6rf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1o6rf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1o6rf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For folding e.g. quads to be a correct play you must be sure that your opponent is so tight that he can <strong>only</strong> play the one hand that has you beat in this spot, as long as he has weaker hands in his hand range, most players will go for the call and most heroes in fiction are very loose.</span>
</li><li> Also, four aces is a hand that shows up far too common, especially in draw poker and is often treated as the highest hand or at least of the highest symbolic value. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ov1y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ov1y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ov1y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Four aces used to be the highest combination before the flush and the straight were introduced before and during the American Civil War respectively, but this seems to apply to works too that are set later than that, like 1880-1900, probably to make it easier for the viewer who hasn't much knowledge about poker)</span> Whenever four kings show up it's almost guaranteed that four aces will take the pot. Cracking four aces with a straight flush is fairly common too, even if the probability for this is close to zero.
</li></ul><p>Of course, this also appears in other games of chance, of which poker is just the most common. It also appears with Roulette and Craps. If you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">Calvinball</a> game, then this overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands">New Rules as the Plot Demands</a>. Overuse of this trope can make the player's skill to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It is the central trope of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, where skilled players have an uncanny ability to always draw the "only" card that will help them, even if it is the ONLY copy of that card in their entire 40-60 card deck. In the manga on which the series is based, this is explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">a superpower</a> of the main character, but in the anime, it appears to be a function of skill and faith, particularly in the English dub by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>. This is a common scenario in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or someone like him is about to duel for the first time. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">opponent</a> will manage to summon their strongest monster on the very first turn. Even if, nay, especially if, that card is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>. They will have the exact combination of cards in their hand to play it.
<ul><li> Detailed in the manga is the 'spirit of the cards', which serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> mechanic for the game. Play nobly, treat your cards well, don't sacrifice willy-nilly, be cool and your luck increases. Be a jerk, cheat, try to cheat, your luck goes spiraling downwards. One should think the jerks would get it.
</li><li> In general, many cards that characters use tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">very, very specific in their usage</a>, especially from later <em>5Ds</em> onward. Once these cards are used, they rarely if ever appear again. They also almost never use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> cards, except as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage">Worf Barrage</a> to show the opponent can deal with them. Pretty much any time a player gets their ace out, it gets beaten by the opponent's ace, often by using cards that would be complete overkill in any practical situation. To reword an above rule, the best Duelist in the world, playing the most important game of his life, will probably beat a monster with 5000 ATK by playing a monster with 10,000 ATK. In real life, he'd probably just play Bottomless Trap Hole and kill it when it hits the field.
</li><li> They've even turned it into a game mechanic in the <em>Tag Force</em> series; called "Destiny Draw", it can be assigned to up to 5 cards, and it only kicks in when you're about to lose. The Destiny Draw visual cue also shows in the anime: if the draw has a white streak following it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes">Power Echoes</a>, or both, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> just got what he needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> Jonouchi's luck is improbable. He has a lot of luck-based cards in his deck (Graceful Dice, Skull Dice, Time Wizard, Roulette Spider, Gamble, Arduous Decision) he <em>almost always</em> rolls/flips/spins right. On the flipside, he also has a lot of bad draws. Time Wizard in particular always spins right (despite being statistically a coin flip), so its effect on other monsters (weakening some, strengthening others) can be shown.
</li><li> Noah had a lot of this going on. His deck was a theme mishmash based on the ages of the world, and he drew the cards he needed to create his narrative in perfect sequence — he draws Greco-Roman cards and earthquake cards on his first turns, then plays Giant Flood, then Giant Rex, then Ice Age Panic, then Black Hole and Victory Viper's support cards. When Yami Yugi steps up to continue the Duel, he replenishes his deck with new cards and only draws his Spirit Monster cards. Given that the arc takes place in a virtual world and Noah is its administrator, it's understandable to assume some foul play being involved.
</li><li> In the climax of the above duel, Yugi pulls off one of the biggest comebacks thus far with the help of this trope. He starts with 100 LP versus Noah's 10,000, has no cards on his field or in his hand. He topdecks Card of Sanctity which effectively lets him draw cards until he has six, and those six cards form just the right combo that allows him to win the Duel on the spot.
</li><li> This was invoked in Jonouchi's duel with Keith Howard. Keith has a giant Slot Machine robot thing which can be powered up by a card called "7 Completed". 7 Completed, consequentially, can only be used with the Slot Machine, and Keith has three of these 7 Completed cards in his deck. After using one, he declares that he will use the others to power up his Slot Machine and beat Jonouchi, to which Jonouchi replies that just because he <em>has</em> them in his deck doesn't mean he will <em>draw</em> them. This is shocking when you consider that at no other point, before or after in the series, has a main character in a major duel ever failed to get the exact card they wanted for their specific situation. Even the bad guys always draw the card they want. In this instance, though, Keith cheats by pulling cards out of his sleeve.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">Berserker Soul scene</a> has Yami Yugi draw eight monster cards in a row just to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">continue beating Weevil up after his LP hits 0</a>. Memetic variants of this scene involve Yugi failing to draw a monster card at all, or getting complete nonsense in the middle of the beatdown.
</li><li> Zigfried's first duel puts him against Haga and Ryuzaki. His opponents have just summoned a reasonably strong monster on their first turn. When Zigfried takes his turn, he wipes them both out using a Ride of the Valkyries. When the details of this card is finally explained, it turns out to be a 5-card combo and he had the perfect mixture of Valkyries in his opening hand to do the job. In a somewhat funnier aversion of this, in his <em>next</em> onscreen duel, he mostly bricks, and so does his opponent, and he has to spend the next few turns stalling out and refreshing his hand until he gets the cards he needs.
</li><li> Entertainingly turned on its head in a scene in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">manga</a> and in the original dub where Kaiba needs to draw a card to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathDealer">throw at a gunman</a>, and prays he'll get a common card. He's disgusted to see it's one of his prized Blue-Eyes White Dragons.

<ul><li> Judai/Jaden from <em>GX</em> has an entire deck that runs on wildly-improbable five-card combos; he can't seem to finish a duel without using up every single card in his hand or on the field, all in one move. Worse still is his heavy reliance on monster fusion, which of course means that he magically has "Polymerization" in his hand without ever having to wait to draw it.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">GX</a></em>, where Misawa (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">for part of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">the series, anyway</a>) has actually calculated the Magic Poker Equation, but doesn't rely on it at all, preferring quick thinking to luck.

</li><li> Edo's second duel with Judai involved using Elemental Heroes, but he switches midway to using Destiny Heroes. Both archetypes had little to no common support at the time, and it looks like he's switched decks completely mid-duel. When the match is replicated in the <em>Legacy of the Duelist</em> video game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> <em>big time</em> for the player as they have to deal with non-synergistic cards without the trope to help them.

</li><li> Manjoume switches decks and archetypes a lot, but by the Society of Light arc he begins mashing his played archetypes together in a single deck. He's played Ojamas alongside Armed Dragons and VWXYZ, and neither of the three archetypes have common support barring a few singular situational cards, yet he never ends up in a situation where he can't use any of the cards he's drawn.
</li><li> Johan uses a deck consisting of the seven Gem Beasts, of which there are only one of each. This means that Johan has only seven monsters in his entire 40-card deck (and Rainbow Dragon, but that has a special summoning condition, and he doesn't have it for a good chunk of the series). Despite this, he never has a problem drawing at least two Gem Beasts in his opening hand. This would almost be justifiable if his other cards let him search for his Monsters, or recycle them when they leave the field, but most of the time, this is not the case.
</li><li> Ikkaku Tachibana relies on Slash Draw, which discards cards from his deck equal to the number of cards on the field, then lets him draw a card, and if it's another Slash Draw, he destroys every card on the field and inflicts 1000 damage to his opponent for each one. He never fails, though it's revealed that he achieves this with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>.
</li><li> Taizan relies on Miracle Draw, which inflicts 1000 damage to his opponent each time he correctly guesses what card he will draw, and 1000 damage to himself if he guesses wrong. He trained to "draw better" by dropping out of school and pulling cards out of a waterfall, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">enabling him to use Miracle Draw effectively</a>. Judai tried to make an aesop about not relying on predicting what you would draw... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">before shuffling his deck and pulling out the card he needed</a>. (It is at this point that one knows for certain that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">the writers were taking the piss</a>.) It's pointed out that Taizan's extensive "drawing training" has caused the rest of his Dueling skills to atrophy. We see characters in other YGO series later practice drawing in much the same way, though.

<ul><li> Yusei is often depicted as seeing the winning path depicted as a line of electricity linking the cards in the chain that will pull it out for him. The winning path is determined after the draw and is in part due to Yusei's ability to read what cards his opponents have and determine the best course of action. However since in the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> every deck seems to run only 1 of each card, Yusei still has to guess at what cards out of a staggeringly huge large card pool and still drawing the necessary cards to play around/against/counter against said opponents.
</li><li> Played a bit with Shooting Star Dragon. Every single time Yusei activates its "attack for all the Tuners on top of your Deck" effect, he gets at least three out of five cards. Normally this wouldn't be too hard - his deck has an abnormally large amount of Tuners he regularly uses - and at one point he even misses out on a clean finisher because he fell one Tuner short of a lethal attack. Though two times he did draw five Tuners in a row, but this is explicitly because the Crimson Dragon was channeling the power of all the Signers into him.
</li><li> The Three Emperors of Yliaster always manage to pull their Core monsters on their first turn, as well as the trap cards they need to trigger its effect and summon their Machine Emperor monster by the next turn.
</li><li> Subverted with Aporia as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>. Aporia has the card After Glow, which shuffles itself into the deck and inflicts 4000 damage to the opponent when it is drawn again (and because 4000 is the starting LP in the anime, it's almost always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>). To maximize his chances of success, he sends all the cards in his deck to the graveyard so that After Glow will be the only card and he will be sure to draw it. Z-One counters this tactic by using a card to shuffle Aporia's graveyard back into his deck and then activating an effect that will burn away the rest of Aporia's LP during his Standby Phase, meaning that Aporia's victory depends on whether he draws After Glow the next turn. Z-one declares that with a 1/34 chance, there is no way Aporia can do it. Aporia declares he can do it and draws... Machine Emperor Granel Infinity, and he loses. To rub salt in the wound, Granel was the same monster that was responsible for the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">great despairs</a>" of Aporia's life, meaning that Aporia drew the <em>worst</em> (or at least the most insulting) possible card that he could have at that moment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> There is an early episode where the opponents in a tag duel are drawing exactly the cards they need to pull off unlikely combos - <em>and the heroes notice their hands are too good</em>. Turns out the opponents were cheaters stacking their decks, but seriously, with the way people draw on this show, how could you tell?
</li><li> A great example is Shark's <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Dimension_Splash">Xyz Dimension Splash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Trap with a very difficult-to-activate condition (it has to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">banished while facedown;</a> banishing a random Set card is something few opponents would do) that supports the summon of Rank 8 Xyz monsters (of which Shark has none). Coincidentally, the Duel he used this in was a Tag Duel with Kaito (who does use Rank 8s) against an opponent whose monster had an indiscriminate banishing effect.
</li><li> ZEXAL turns this into a superpower of sorts with the Shining Draw ability, which can let Yuma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">create a new card to draw</a>, but he can only do so under specific circumstances (it's basically this trope justified by magic). In the end, a total of eleven episodes featured the ability, only a small fraction. Yuma later faces Eliphas, who can do a Shining Draw <em>whenever he feels like it</em>, unlike Yuma, who can usually only do it once or twice a duel and usually needs to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> with Astral first.

<ul><li> Yuya has the tendency to draw his three main Pendulum Monsters (Stargazer Magician, Timegazer Magician, and Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon) in his first turn or only a few turns later. Though in episode 22, he starts with a dead hand, having six high-level monsters that cannot be Pendulum Summoned because his highest scale would be too low to summon any of them. He draws his Timegazer Magician in his third turn and then summons five monsters at once, but he is still followed with terrible luck in the very same turn. As of later episodes, Yuya's starting to get less lucky with his draws, forcing him to use the cards he has and sometimes not even drawing one of his Magicians.
</li><li> Reiji Akaba's DD deck first averts this trope, since he uses cards that allow him to add specific cards from his deck to his hand, until he draws multiple cards at once, which turn out to be his three copies of his DDD Cruel End King Hell Armageddon.
</li><li> Tokumatsu is famous in-universe for doing this. It's been hinted through his chanting and poses before drawing the card he needs that this might be a supernatural ability similar to the Shining Draw, but this is unconfirmed.
</li><li> Kurosaki gets an opening hand with three copies of Raidraptor - Vanishing Lanius with disturbing frequency.
</li><li> Once Yuya gets his hands on Smile World, a mediocre card that slightly boosts the ATK of every monster on the field, he somehow keeps finding situations and combos that make it relevant.
</li><li> Surprisingly enough, there is actually some aversion to this trope when looking at the deck types used in the series. Hokuto and Yaiba, who use the Constellar and X-Saber archetypes respectively, make pretty standard plays in respect to how the real <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> card game is played. With those Archetypes, getting out one or two monsters with 2500+ ATK on the first turn is pretty normal, especially when it's shown that characters carry multiple copies of cards.
</li><li> Dennis unveiling his alliance with the Fusion Dimension also involves him suddenly using a Fusion card when he's spent most of his screentime playing the Xyz-centric Performages. This is downplayed slightly as a lot of the Fusion Materials he's using is coming out of his Extra Deck, which hardly compromises the rest of his Main Deck.

Despite D'arby cheating to rig the hands, Jotaro manages to bluff him out of the game by not looking at his hand, making it look like he <em>might</em> have used his powers to change his cards, adopting his usual poker face, and then continually raising until the stakes were just too high for D'arby to risk calling on. After the game was over, Jotaro's hand was flipped over, and it was revealed that he had absolute shit. ... And humorously admitted that if he <em>had</em> looked at his cards, he would've freaked. Cue everyone yelling at him.
<ul><li> D'Arby also seemingly takes pains to avoid this in the prior hand (assuming he was rigging it that well), where Jotaro is dealt two pair, which D'Arby beats with a simple higher two pair. Presumably, he wanted Jotaro to think the hands <em>weren't</em> rigged.

<div class="indent"><strong>Bewitched:</strong> I got four kings. <br/><strong>Bothered:</strong> I got five — all hearts. <br/><strong>Bemildred:</strong> One a' you is mus' be cheatin', 'cause I <em>never</em> had no kings of hearts in no deck of <em>mine.</em>
</div></li><li> Parodied in a scene in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Sovisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Sovisa">Sovisa</a></em>, where the other players have stopped playing in favor of watching Alexi and Travis, in one of their one-upsmanship bouts, <em>both</em> trying to out-cheat the other. Alexi opens with a royal flush in hearts, only to be countered by Travis' royal flush in <em>spades</em>. The dealer at this point, exclaims "OH COME ON! That's barely even physically possible!". Even more silly, is that cheating in cards is usually done <em>by</em> the one dealing, and it's quite difficult to do otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>: In one strip, Calvin and Hobbes are playing poker.

<ul><li> In the short comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> fanfic <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3480341/1/The_Night_The_House_of_Cards_Was_Built">'The Night the House of Cards Was Built'<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, 6-year old Naruto end up playing in the weekly Konoha high stakes poker game by convincing the Hokage to let him join in with the pocket money he saved up. Despite having <em>no</em> idea how to play at all (due to being, well, 6 years old) Naruto manages to consistently win against everyone thanks to a combination of extreme confidence in hands he doesn't know the value of until everyone else folds, and sheer jaw-dropping luck. He starts off by winning Anko and Kurenai as his personal servants in a perfect illustration of the "first to show loses" rule (Anko shows a Diamond Flush, Queen high, only for Danzo to show Spade Flush, King high and already be in mid-gloat when Naruto innocently reveals he has a pair of threes... and another pair of threes) and at the end of the night he breaks the bank and ends up with (among other things) millions of ryou, half a dozen expensive properties around town (including the Hyuuga clan mansion), several of the other players' daughters (including Hinata, Hanabi, Ino, Tenten and also Sasuke's mother Mikoto thanks to a drunken bet by Uchiha Fugaku) and the rights to The Uchiha Secret of ultimate power. Suffice it to say that, among other aspects of this trope, the fic took Open Stakes poker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the name of comedy. However, the one part it <em>does</em> rather oddly subvert is that Naruto wins the ultimate hand by beating Uchiha Fugaku's Full House with a simple Four-of-a-Kind rather than something more dramatic like a Royal Flush (although it WAS four identical copies of the Four of Hearts, with no explanation given for how he could have ended up with that hand, as the Hokage himself explicitly rules out cheating on his part).
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic has Harry win a high-stakes poker game by beating Draco Malfoy's four-of-a-kind with a five-of-a-kind.

Being Yugioh, there is no doubt that this trope will be present, but one of the duels had it downplayed one turn, played straight the next, the subverted on the final turn.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCincinnatiKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCincinnatiKid">The Cincinnati Kid</a></em>, the climactic hand features a game of 5-card stud where The Kid (Steve McQueen) gets dealt a full house only to lose to The Man (Edward G. Robinson) and his straight flush. According to Anthony Holden in his book <em>Big Deal: A Year As A Professional Poker Player</em>, the chances of the final hand are 45,102,781 to 1, and that the situation in particular would only arise once every 443 years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point, Bond loses all his 10 million because he wagered it for his kings full of aces. Le Chiffre, however, had a four-of-a-kind, which is higher than Bond's (already high) full house.
</li><li> Think about that climatic hand: One player has an ace-king-queen flush, the next has eights full of aces, Le Chiffre has aces full of sixes, and Bond has a straight flush 4-to-8. The odds of all four players having very strong hands on the same hand like that is astronomical.
</li><li> As an added bonus, the winning hand also follows the "whoever shows his cards first, loses" portion of the trope to exacting degree - the first hand revealed is the flush, which is immediately trumped by the full house, which in turn is trumped by Le Chiffre's higher full house, which is then ultimately trumped by Bond's straight flush. Bond is the last player to reveal his cards.
</li><li> It does at least subvert 'the tell' giveaway - Le Chiffre was faking his throughout the entire game, tricking Bond into thinking his hand is much weaker than it really is. But Bond being faked out by the tell turns out to be irrelevant—because tell or no tell, any poker player would bet everything they had on a kings/aces full house.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting subversion of this happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elektra King</span> bets a million dollars on a high-card draw at the casino of one of Bond's old nemeses/informants... and loses (though the loss was only by a slim margin; a king versus an ace). Turns out, the bid was a buyout for a favor, so the loss would've happened, anyway. Interestingly, Bond, before the cards were drawn, demanded the top three cards be buried, to prevent tampering with the deck and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> expression hits the dealers face immediately.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kaleidoscope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight in the big game between Barney and Harry. Barney appeared to be winning with two pair over Harry's three of a kind, until Harry dramatically flips over his fifth card and reveals a full house. Per the trope the last person to reveal the card wins, when Harry flips over his fifth card to reveal <em>another</em> full house (another strong hand, per the trope), with his three kings beating Harry's three tens. The trope is also played straight with Barney and Harry being the last players with cards after the other players have folded.
</li><li> Manny and his assistant Aimes are just goofing around playing cards while they wait for the big operation to go down. Manny, who is trying to read the cards in one of Barney's marked decks, fails. He is astonished when Aimes flips over his cards and reveals...a royal flush.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rounders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rounders">Rounders</a></em>, Teddy KGB, the villain, is supposedly a great poker player. He very conspicuously eats Oreo cookies while playing, and he has a very obvious tell when he had a good hand by eating them in a peculiar way. Matt Damon's character is apparently the first person to ever notice it. Damon also defeats him in the end by laying an extremely simple trap in which he remarks, suspiciously casually given the fact that the stakes of this particular game are implied to be his life, that he is "gambling" by calling KGB's bet, implying that he is hoping to draw a flush (when in fact he has already made his hand, a straight). While this sort of table chatter might be effective in a casual home game, any poker book will tell you that representing weakness when you are strong and representing strength when you are weak is the oldest trick in the book. No poker player of KGB's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">supposed</a> caliber would be taken in by such a simple ploy, nor would any player of Damon's caliber attempt it on one of KGB's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick">Maverick</a></em> plays with the trope throughout the film, as Bret Maverick is convinced that he can draw any card out of the deck at will. However, most of his attempts are completely unsuccessful <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the end of the film, when he manages to draw the Ace of Spades he needs to complete his Royal Flush and win the poker tournament</span>. The final poker battle on the gambling ship at the end of the film is made of this trope. First, Maverick beats Annabelle by showing his cards, after she thought she won and already started collecting the winnings. Next, the final showdown between Maverick, Angel, and the Commodore. The Commodore shows his hand first: "Two small pair. Eights... and eights." Then Angel shows his hand, "See if you can beat my straight flush!" Maverick finally reveals his royal flush and wins it all, without saying a word. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hiov');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3hiov" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hiov');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Maverick noticed the dealer dealing from the bottom of a stacked deck.</span> Also, a large part of the movie is of Annabelle trying to get Maverick to tell her his tells, and she ends up losing on the poker ship from the one tell he didn't let her know about.

It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's a con-man, but his con requires all of his marks to get huge hands at the same time.

Having bet all his money on his ability to read people, and already gone all-in, the gangster offers him a loan to stay in the game. Eddi had two choices at that point; take the loan and call, or fold, and walk away having lost everything. Eddie rather unwisely chose to believe he was bluffing. It should also be mentioned that neither character had particularly good cards (one of the other players incredulously exclaims "That's it!?" when he sees a half-million pound pot won with a pair of tens) and the game is not poker, but three-card brag, which is one of poker's parent games, but has very different betting rules.
</li><li> The Hong Kong movie series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodOfGamblers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodOfGamblers">God of Gamblers</a></em> is filled with several instances of this trope. Made more amazing is the fact that they attribute the "pick the best card" to an actual skill.
</li><li> Averted in the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhGodYouDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhGodYouDevil">Oh, God! You Devil</a></em>. God (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBurns">George Burns</a>) beats the Devil (also played by George Burns) in a hand of poker when the Devil decides to fold. And what was God's downright amazing hand? Complete garbage.
</li><li> Briefly seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunFatBoyRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunFatBoyRun">Run Fat Boy Run</a></em>. Dylan Moran's character is playing a backroom game of Texas Hold'Em and bets all of his remaining money; his King-high flush is beaten by an Ace-high flush.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime">In Time</a></em>, the protagonist wins an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">Absurdly High-Stakes Game</a>. He has 8-4 versus the queens of his opponent, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The board is: Queen - seven - jack (flop); six (turn); five (river). In other words, the villain was way ahead with his set of queens, but thanks to the trope, the hero got a straight with the last card. Don't try to play poker like that, unless you <em>want</em> to lose.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunLolaRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunLolaRun">Run Lola Run</a></em>, the third ending has the heroine play Roulette and win a single-number bet twice in a row by <em>wanting</em> it really badly. This is apparently her karmic reward for trying to come by the money honestly rather than stealing it, as she did in the previous scenarios. Or else her glass-shattering scream also allowed her to control which number the ball landed on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PokerNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PokerNight">Poker Night</a></em> has the main character produce four twos to defeat a full house in the ultimate game. However, Jeter is shown still in chains and he notes that two of the players are already dead, so it's ambiguous as to whether he ever actually played that hand in the real game, or if it was symbolic of that he could still win.

Granny also mentions learning the game from another old witch with a '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLinearCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLinearCharacter">detached retina in her Second Sight</a>'. She learned fast.
</li><li> However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, Granny Weatherwax's poker game against Death to save a child's life is a subversion. Granny has four queens, while Death has four aces. Death chooses to dismiss his hand as "just four ones". The cards came out like that because Granny cheated. She'd have had the four aces in her hand if Death hadn't had them switch. The trick here, is <em>both of them</em> wanted Granny to win (Death's got a soft spot for humanity); they just went through the pantomime because those were the rules.
</li></ul></li><li> In in Robert Asprin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Little Myth Marker</a></em>, where hero Skeeve finds himself in a flashy high stakes poker challenge; he puts the entire stakes on the first hand without even looking at his cards. The twist being, as he explains to his opponent, he does so because he knows he <em>doesn't</em> have any outstanding skill at the game — but essentially reducing the game to a coin flip makes the skill gap irrelevant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But he wins with a big flashy hand anyhow.</span> It's Dragon Poker, which Asprin probably got the idea for from watching the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> episode "A Piece of the Action" (anyone familiar with both series will think "Fizzbin" while reading the book, and "Dragon Poker" while watching the Trek episode). Depending on the day, the hands that have already happened, where you're sitting compared to the other players, where you're sitting based on the compass, and any number of other factors, an otherwise unremarkable hand can wipe out a royal flush no problem. What got Skeeve into trouble was the fact that he had a fairly reasonable success rate playing as best he could and letting <em>everyone else</em> work out whether he'd won or lost the hand. What he didn't realize until later was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the dealer was cheating on Skeeve's behalf for that initial success, as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">larger scheme</a> to infiltrate a literal Character Assassin into Skeeve's home.</span> Though this didn't affect the game described above.

The story concerns a young gambler who wishes to gain the secret of getting three good cards in a row from an elderly countess. After she refuses to tell him, he ends up threatening and frightening her to death, and is then visited by her in a dream with the secret. Wishing to marry his much wealthier sweetheart, he places all of his money on a bet and then loses everything when the final card turns out to be the wrong one.

The chances of this happening, needless to say, are astronomically small.
<ul><li> Actually lampshaded in the book. While the odds of drawing a royal flush are incredibly low, technically they're the same as the odds of drawing any other specific combination of 5 cards.

</li><li> In Joe Queenan's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/America" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/America">America</a></em>, Queenan describes an occasion when he went to Atlantic City and sat in on a table with experienced poker players. Not really knowing anything about the game, he just bet when he felt lucky, and started winning — and got a lot of derision from the experienced players for screwing up the 'system'. After one of them took him aside and explained it to him, he started betting by the system — and promptly lost all his winnings and more besides. Not entirely surprisingly, he concluded that the system blows.
</li><li> The short story <em>Bump</em> by Jeffrey Deaver has a high stakes, cash on the table poker game between celebrities (all of whom need a "bump" in their career). The final showdown has the protagonist with an improbably high hand losing to his opponent with an equally improbably high hand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonist later privately calls out the tournament producer on the dramatic showdown. The game and show were rigged for with the help of the double-dealing dealer. The short story ends with the protagonist implicitly blackmailing him for the bump he was after in the first place.</span>

His winning hand is "pure sabacc" - a hand of exactly 23, the second most valuable hand in the game. As a bonus, the cards used shift value at random, and Han's cards shifted from 0 (the worst possible hand) to 23 just before the final round of betting.
</li><li> In How To Beat Your Friends at Poker, the narrator is a card mechanic skilled at nearly undetectable card marking and sleight of hand. He's a real scumbag, so he spends his career getting invited to home games of wealthy individuals and taking them for what he can before skipping town. He eventually decided to publish his memoir, and called in a favor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller">Penn Jillette</a> to get the book published. The narrator specifically advises <em>against</em> letting his plays ever come close to looking like this trope. He specifically sets up the hands that take his "friends" to be very believable, counting on their reasonable betting patterns during a normal-seeming bad-beat where everyone's actions made sense after the fact. In short, the hands that moved a lot of money his way were based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>.

</li><li> In "I am a Nucleus" by Stephen Barr, a poker game between friends turns ugly because, every time the owner of the flat where the game takes place is the dealer, he always deals himself a king-high straight flush and somebody else four aces. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be because the protagonist, a neighbour of the poker player, is the focus of a storm of luck, both good and bad.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale">Casino Royale</a></em>, Bond is assigned to clean out Le Chiffre at baccarat (a game similar to blackjack where the banker and player try to get as close to 9 as possible with the tens digits dropped; a total of 18 is actually an 8 in the game rules). The banker cannot see their opponent's hand and only gets to see the third card they're dealt, making it a psychological game where the banker must try to predict what their opponent's hand must have been to make them take a third card. Bond initially ends up completely cleaned out by a series of bad hands (with Le Chiffre winning with a 9) and has to get funded by the CIA to keep going. When he returns to the game, he gets dealt a king and a queen (a total of 0) and is handed a 9 as his third card. His second hand has Le Chiffre with a 0 and Bond dealt a natural 9!
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Moonraker">Moonraker</a></em>. At the beginning, Bond is asked by M to help prove that Hugo Drax is cheating at cards at his club. Bond quickly figures out that Drax is just using his mirror-sheen cigarette case to see the cards he deals to the other players at bridge, and so he uses a loaded deck swap to defeat him for intimidation. He arranges for Drax to get the same hand that was infamously dealt from a loaded deck to scam the Duke of Cumberland in the 19th century: it looks like a very strong hand of high-value cards, but is not strong in any suit, while Bond has every single clubs card. Bond simply sets clubs as the trump suit for the bet and uses that to gradually drain Drax's hand until he's out of cards.

<div class="indent"><strong>Stuart Millard</strong>: Is it likely the producers wanted to prove that such an unbelievable hand could be authentically achieved, by re-doing the scene as many times as it took to draw the right cards for real?

By the last hand, it's down to Arthur and the host — and Arthur wins almost all the money by bluffing when his hand is complete junk. The cool kids are amazed.

It transpires Boycie <em>isn't</em> bluffing, and Del only has two pair. He then waits for Boycie to start raking in the winnings before inevitably adding "A pair of aces, and... another pair of aces".

One man's full house seemingly had the other guy's made straight beat with the river to go, only to have the latter get his last out and make a straight flush. The improbability of the hands is even lampshaded by Mike. This is subverted later in the episode when Harvey tries to win the loser's company back in another game. He starts by betting big and the other guy folds. Harvey reveals that he was bluffing which together with other mind games causes his opponent to lose his confidence. Harvey then proceeds to grind away the other guy's money by winning small bets on fairly mundane hands. The other guy is so off his game that he never tries to bet big and in the long run Harvey is the better player.

<ul><li> A term in the card game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, <em>mise</em>, sometimes refers to the critical gamewinning card drawn at exactly the right moment, usually without the aid of tutoring or library manipulating effects (unless you mise the <em>tutor</em> spell and use that to extract your winning card). Mising is referred to a <em>lot</em> in tournaments by article-writing professionals. Some pros have the superstition that mising happens more often during dramatic moments. It's a contraction of (the player) "might as well have" (drawn some specific obviously gamewinning card). There's also a joke card called Mise, which lets you draw three cards if you correctly guess the name of the top card of your library. The Unhinged version shows a rabbit monster using its own foot for luck while rolling dice, and the DCI promo version shows dogs playing Magic. The flavor text of the DCI version is: "Statistically mind-staggering as it might seem, the term "mise" was in fact coined simultaneously by over one thousand Magic players." In fact tournament level decks in Magic <em>are</em> more likely to draw the card they want than ordinary decks. Including cards that manipulate deck statistics is a critical part of design. A skilled player can often make decks in such a way that several cards in their deck can <em>be</em> the critical gamewinning card. <em>Magic</em> players going through their decks post-game might realize that the odds of drawing the card they need to win is rather high simply because, whatever the card, they could make use of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> it's called 'god drawing' or 'godhanding', and occasionally 'topdecking' (though 'topdecking' often refers explicitly to drawing cards when you have nothing in your hand). Due to the anime, it is also often called 'destiny draw' or 'heart of the cards'. A number of cards, including The Seventh One, Palladium Oracle Mahad, Symbol of Friendship, and Infernity Archfiend, are even designed with this in mind, only being usable when drawn and having the power to turn a duel around if you pull them off.
</li><li> Made part of the basic mechanics of <em>Doomtown</em>, the collectible card game based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>. Doomtown cards have playing card values on them, which are used for a variety of purposes, particularly combat: each round of a shootout is ultimately resolved by drawing a number of cards and trying to build the best five-card hand you can from them. Skill comes into it because your characters and actions in the shootout affect how many cards you draw and can discard and replace, along with the fact that your deck normally does <em>not</em> have a normal distribution of values, but one that you decided on. While a hand that has multiples of the same value/suit card is certainly possible, it makes you vulnerable to game-changing "Cheatin!" cards, so those five Kings may not be as good as you thought. The importance of the hand also factors in, as players are more likely to use up resources to improve an important fight that they wouldn't use over a minor scuffle.
</li><li> An interesting version of this, ironically not applicable to poker as such, appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em>.

</li><li> Taken to extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/UnnaturalSelection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/UnnaturalSelection">Unnatural Selection</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame">rigged poker game</a> in thread 12, due to the crooked dealer lacking subtlety. After having been suspiciously lucky the first two turns, the viewpoint character is dealt a straight flush, but decides to fold rather than make the cheat <em>that</em> obvious. Several other players go all-in... And in the end reveal three other straight flushs and a four-of-a-kind. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">Jaw Drop</a> from the remaining player, who only had a full house.

<ul><li> Played strictly for laughs several times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> cartoons:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbaryCoastBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbaryCoastBunny">Barbary Coast Bunny</a>". The villain gets a full house, to which a dejected Bugs (disguised as a gullible country bumpkin) moans, "Gee, all I got is two pair. A pair of ones, and another pair of ones." He is referring to a Quad of aces, the second highest value hand in the rules of poker. He also manages to win several other casino games, despite the fact they've all been rigged by the same villain.
</li><li> Later, in "Bonanza Bunny", he decides to play a round of blackjack with only one card. The villain has two tens in his hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveAcesCheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveAcesCheater">(they're both the 10 of Spades; he pulled the second out of his sleeve)</a>, but loses anyway, as Bugs has drawn the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">21 of Hearts</a>.
</li><li> In "Mississippi Hare", riverboat gambler Colonel Shuffle holds five aces - and Bugs beats him with a hand of <em>six</em> aces.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> cartoon had him playing a quick game against some small creature. We clearly see Donald cheating, pulling out aces from all sorts of places to get four aces. His opponent has <em>five</em> aces.
</li><li> Humourously subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>: The Ghostbusters are pursuing the ghosts of four Old West desperados, and Peter gets snagged into a poker game with the four spirits. When it comes time to call, each of the ghosts produces two aces, two eights and a ten (the "dead man's hand"). Peter then produces four aces, whereupon the ghosts accuse him of cheating and draw their guns. Peter escapes and mutters how wise it was of him not to show them the fifth ace.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> cartoon episode, Snoopy held five aces including the "ace of anchors"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spoofed where Fat Tony and an underling are playing cards.
<div class="indent"><strong>Louie:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardSharp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardSharp">Six queens.</a> Read 'em and weep. <br/><strong>Fat Tony:</strong> Uh-uh-uh, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlockOfWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlockOfWolves">seven</a></em> queens.
</div></li><li> A similar joke shows up in "Bart the Murderer", where we see the hands of various mobsters. One has four aces and a king... panning over to another, who has <em>five</em> aces. Then we see the discard pile, which is nothing but aces, many of which aren't even aces of standard card suits (ace of stars, ace of smiley faces, ace of planets). Later on in the episode, Homer is overjoyed that he got "another pair of sixes!"
</li><li> Played straight when Krusty's four aces is beaten by Fat Tony's straight flush. Though Krusty and Fat Tony broke the betting rule mentioned above by raising with violins, Rolexes, and whatnot. But it <em>is</em> a mob game, after all.
</li><li> Comically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> when Mr. Burns wins a basketball team and millions of dollars in a single hand... which he wins with a nine-high. His opponent had a seven, which is actually the <em>lowest</em> poker hand you can have. To have a seven-high, you need a two, a seven, and exactly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6q2ep');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6q2ep" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6q2ep');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">all four of them would complete the 7-high straight</span> three of the four cards from 3 to 6. If you had hand where the highest card was a six, you'd either have at least one pair, or it would be a straight, and a five or lower would always require a pair. In other words: The only way you can win with seven-high is if you bluff your opponent successfully. Bad for you if he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">bad enough</a> to call with any pair. Or any high card. Or even nine-high, which is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">worse than most bluffs</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMarvelousMisadventuresOfFlapjack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMarvelousMisadventuresOfFlapjack">The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack</a></em>. When K'nuckles bets Flapjack in a poker game, he wins with a pair of threes (the opponent had a pair of twos).
</li><li> Spoofed in the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> movie, "Into the Wild Green Yonder". Bender, who has a lucky robot's foot and always catches cards, and Fry, who can read minds, face off in the final hand of a poker tournament. Fry has two aces, but can't know Bender's hand because he didn't look at his cards. When it comes to showdown, Fry makes the absolute nuts, four aces, only for Bender to make five kings by being dealt a coaster called "The King of Beers".
</li><li> Parodied in one old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a> short. A very high-stakes poker game, complete with sinister shady characters smoking cigars, comes down to the last hand, and when it's called...

</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Warner Bros.</a> cartoon "Early To Bet," the cat whose luck at gin rummy against a bulldog was awful (having to perform a "penalty" each time he loses) deals for high card against the Gambling Bug. The cat draws a three, but the Gambling Bug draws a two. The cat metes out a penalty on the bug—a rolled up newspaper! ("No! Not that! Not the Post!!")
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, Zeb is playing Lando Calrissian in sabacc and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostHimInACardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostHimInACardGame">wagers Chopper</a>; both have hands which are implied in context to be very good: Zeb has a sabacc and Lando has an Idiot's Array (see Star Wars entries under Literature). Justified since Zeb wouldn't take a risk like that (and Kanan wouldn't back him up on it) unless he had something nearly unbeatable - but Lando still needed to win, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">or else there'd be no plot</a> (it was strongly implied that Lando was cheating).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DofusTheTreasuresOfKerubim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DofusTheTreasuresOfKerubim">Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim</a></em> episode Ecaflip City part 2, both poker games shown follow this trope, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">Absurdly High-Stakes Game</a>. The first game resulted in 3s over 10s, Jacks over Kings, 4 Queens, and 4 Aces, the later drawn purely by luck on the last round. In the second game, a J-7 straight is beaten by an A-10 straight. Justified in that they were being manipulated by the god of luck.

<ul><li> Played straight by Doyle Brunson, who won the No Limit Hold 'Em championship at the 1976 World Series of Poker by turning a humble 10-2 offsuit into a full house. That's not terribly remarkable by itself, but then he did the same thing with the exact same hand a year later, the odds against which are astronomical. The hand has been known as "The Doyle" ever since.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTitda__63o&amp;t=26">Quad aces vs. royal flush<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has happened in the 2008 World Series of Poker Texas Hold 'Em (possible with community cards), although it was not the final hand. The probability for this is <em>1:1.27 billion</em>. All players were in complete shock when they saw this and no player really made a mistake here.
</li><li> Has happened a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> tournaments:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t0pzLnSWw0">Topdeck of the Century<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: During Pro Tour Honolulu, Craig Jones was in a very bad position against Olivier Ruel in the deciding game of the semifinals set. The commentators were theorizing he'd take the safer play of using his only direct-damage spell on Ruel's creatures, giving him more time to live and potentially draw what he needed. Jones instead, figuring he was in such a bad position he'd lose even with an extra turn or two, opted to use the spell on Ruel. He had one and only one out: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386343">Lightning Helix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the one spell in his deck that would deal the remaining damage needed to his foe without killing himself in the process. Ruel gets to his feet: "Slam it!" he said. "Don't look, just slam it!" It was Lightning Helix. That Lightning Helix won Craig Jones $16,000.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Commentator:</strong> OH IT'S LIGHTNING HELIX! OH MY GOD!
</div></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_LZGBN5qU">Gabriel Nassif's Called Shot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: Gabriel Nassif was a turn away from losing his quarterfinal match against Matteo Orsini-Jones. On his turn, he draws his card but doesn't look at it, then arranges his lands, saying "I'm putting together my Ultimatum mana." That would be <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=175079">Cruel Ultimatum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a card that would turn the tables in a hurry. Then, he finally looks at his card...and sure enough, it's Cruel Ultimatum, giving him the match and, eventually, the tournament.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in a World Championship match where Kai Budde is about to lose but draws a Morphling, the one card in his deck that can turn the game around for him. After he wins, people comment on his incredible luck but players and commentators quickly pointed out that Kai's deck is full of card drawing and deck manipulation cards. For the last dozen or so turns he has been using these cards to dig deeper into his deck and maximized his odds of drawing the Morphling. It was still lucky for him to get it on that turn but he only got it because his superior playing skills got him to that point.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/Z-6Sz-u56gM?t=5m10s">Double Crit; all on the vanguard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Izumi Kitta, the voice actress of Misaki Tokura, in stark contrast with the character she voices often wins through double triggers after often breaking her opponent's guard. This has lead to her nickname "Izuqualia."
