<p><em>The fertility of a species is inversely proportional to its lifespan. Thus, as a species approaches immortality, their birth rate approaches zero.</em>
</p><p>In many works of fiction featuring immortality, the immortals in question are sterile or infertile: they cannot have children. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyImmortality">Legacy Immortality</a> is both impossible and unnecessary.
</p><p>In many cases, this is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a>, because, along with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity">STD Immunity</a>, it means that the teen-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">ancient</a> vampire stud can get it on with the ladies as much as he wants without worrying about consequences of any sort, particularly leaving lovers pregnant with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr">Dhampyr</a> who will eventually grow up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateYouVampireDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateYouVampireDad">try to kill him</a>. Or at least demand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption">child support</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Immortals may have methods of making mortals immortal (vampire bite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, or the like) and they may come to view those that they bring over into immortality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">as their own children</a>, teaching them the lessons and how to thrive as an immortal. This, however, is not the same as having natural children. It's more like adoption and a new immortal being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">Happily Adopted</a> is certainly possible.
</p><p>Sometimes the beings in question are perfectly able to have children, but are not allowed to, by the laws of their society, because allowing immortals to breed will quickly lead to overpopulation. This usage tends to be found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a>.
</p><p>Another common twist is to have immortals that are quite fertile/potent but whose children are completely or near-completely mortal. These examples are also included here because they fit in with the theme that unchecked reproduction combined with immortality is unsustainable. This aversion is probably even more tragic, since the immortal will then be forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivingOnesOffspring">watch their children die as they inevitably outlive them all</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In a strictly biological sense this trope is fairly logical. Without death, an immortal population would constantly grow and eventually crowd themselves out and deplete their resources. As such, childbirth isn't really a necessity for such a species, since the members rarely need replacement. The above formula can (loosely) apply to any given species.
</p><p>This trope includes extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a> characters and species with low birth rates, as they fit on the sliding scale properly. The most common example of this is elves; Tolkienesque elves generally are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a> and can have children; their population is mitigated by a low birth rate (a typical elf couple can live together for several thousand years and produce only one or two children in all that time), the occasional violent death, and the tendency for older elves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">journey across the sea to a mystical land, never to be seen again</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a>; this is a focus on sexual reproduction. It can result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a> if the immortals can still be killed.

<ul><li> The vampire Evangeline has been around for hundreds of years, and presumably never reproduced. Although this may have more to do with the fact that she's evil, uber powerful, and scary as hell, as well as the fact that she gained immortality when she was ten years old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGrowingUpSucks">and has been stuck that way since</a>.

Setsuna quickly starts to think about how it will be practically impossible for him to father any children like that.

He bring this up in Chapter 1 of the actual series as well

The one Bount that did have the ability to reproduce was killed by her own people as part of some elaborate ritual to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">summon an army of flying, soul-sucking insects</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em> it's discovered that the "True Blooded" vampires can, in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">turning those they feed on</a> into theoretically weaker ones, reproduce sexually. Problem is that females can give birth once and they apparently reach adulthood very slowly. Bigger problem is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dukes Ivanovic, Li, and Rozenmann apparently killed off the other 97 dukes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">and their families</a> <em>then</em> slaughtered the whole Royal House of Tepes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">save for the young Princess Mina</a> (who is under obligation to produce a True Blooded heir).</span>
</li><li> Huey Laforet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> procreated after becoming immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">just to see if this applied</a>. His daughter doesn't inherit his immortality.
</li><li> The Juraians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> have vast lifespans (one prominent member of the royal family is over 5,000 years old; she looks 35-40, tops), but their birth rates seem to be quite low. The Juraian emperor, for example, has been married to two women (at the same time) for over 700 years, and only had 3 children between them. His mother-in-law (the above-mentioned 5,000 year old Juraian) has only one biological daughter; while she's raised several other children, they were all adopted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> it is mentioned that the longer a species life span is, the less they reproduce. The pillar men were a long lived species outnumbered by the short lived humans, and when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Cars becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">Ultimate Life Form</a>, it is mentioned that he can no longer reproduce and doesn't need to, as he will never die.
<div class="indent"><em>Sex = Useless</em>
</div><ul><li> Despite this, it is shown that vampires are still capable of reproduction as seen with series antagonist DIO's four illegitimate children from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Stone Ocean</a></em>. Although none of them inherited their father's vampiric abilities, let alone his immortality.
</li><li> Although DIO was just a head controlling his adopted brother Jonathan's body. So technically he was using Jonathan's, er, parts to have his children. So we don't know if he could have had children before being reduced to a head.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SundayWithoutGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SundayWithoutGod">Sunday Without God</a></em>, when people lost the ability to die due to God abandoning the world, they also lost the ability to give birth. As pointed out in-series, this makes Ai's existence even more perplexing, as she was born three years <em>after</em> God had abandoned the world.
</li><li> A rare subversion of this trope for Elves is in the manga / light novel series 'Nidome no Jinsei wo Isekai de'. Here Elves are extremely long-lived AND just as fertile as humans. The Elven King(who's been around for a few centuries) is noted to have over 150 children, which makes the royal succession a nightmare.
<ul><li> Another subversion is 'Clearing an Isekai with the Zero-Believers Goddess'. Elves have a life expectancy 5 times as long as humans but are just as fertile. One of the main characters is the descendant of a legendary elven hero who married over 50 women and fathered hundreds of children. Even Lucy has over 50 siblings through her elven mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Pure-Blooded Devils in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em> are implied to have 10,000 year lifespans, and proportionately low fertility. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a> caused a severe depopulation, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArsGoetia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArsGoetia">72</a> former great houses being reduced to <em>three</em> and remnants, this has become a serious problem. As of the start of the series, even high-ranking devils of the remaining noble houses are recruiting from humans they personally reincarnate, just to get their numbers back up and stabilize the population.

<ul><li> One tribe of elves had no children for <em>millennia</em>, partly because of stagnation (they were hiding from the world in a "fortress" and would not outgrow it). On the flip side, the Wolfriders have wolf blood, which may make them more fertile (they're definitely not immortal anymore especially compared to the other tribes); a past chief, Two-Spear, was born to his father's lifemate, not his Recognized mate.

Humans who have taken the Detian treatment can have children. It's just that the current crop of Detians haven't had very many.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> notes this with regard to Asgardians (who are, in turn, more fertile than their technically immortal godly relatives, and significantly more fecund with human men and women - though even then, children aren't common). It also notes that those who take the Elixir of Life, such as Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, automatically become infertile as a result of the Elixir. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Infinity Formula, on the other hand, subverts this trope</span>.

There are only two known cases of alicorns producing offspring. The first involved six alicorns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the deep past of the series</a> who gave up their immortality to bring forth the first ponies. The second was the birth of Cadence, daughter of Princess Luna, as the result of a unique confluence of magical forces.
</li><li> The Justice Champions from <em>Sailor Moon: Legends of Lightstorm</em> are kind of like this. Their infertility comes from their bodies diverting resources toward more critical systems, such as the mechanisms that generate their powers. This condition can be temporarily reversed by drinking the correct chemical compound.
</li><li> Anyone made immortal by Naruto and Xanna in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10917821/1/The-questionable-burdens-of-leadership-of-a-troll-Emperor">The (Questionable) Burdens of Leadership of a Troll Emperor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> are also rendered sterile both to prevent straining the empire's resources with a growing immortal population and to make sure they're serious about it. Only one named character, Setsuna, is shown to have become immortal and after all the enemies of the Celestial Empire are defeated, she asks to be made mortal again and to have a child with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>.
</li><li> An unusual variant comes up in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://ficwad.com/story/213011">Eroninja<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

Also, Naruto can't have children (Kyuubi/Kiyomi's chakra kills his sperm when he orgasms) so the only way for them to have children is by breaking up with him and taking another lover. Kiyomi is willing to also make immediate family of Naruto's lovers immortal but they'll be under the same conditions: being rendered sterile in exchange for eternal youth.

Melinda notably averts getting angsty over it because she considers the children she's adopted over the centuries like Tails no less her children than biological offspring would be.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Delusions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Delusions">Delusions</a></em>. Celestia and Luna can't reproduce not because they're alicorns, but because they're just infertile—they were born mules and kept their infertility even upon ascension.

At least, there's no indication that any other Corvinus bloodline existed for Lucien's agents to hunt down.
<ul><li> Of course, considering that Alexander Corvinus has spent much of his immortal life "cleaning up" after vampires and lycans, keeping the existence of immortals secret, it's also possible he could have had other children in secret. Given how old he is, it could very well be that a good number of people are his descendants and don't know it (it's also made clear that not every descendant carries an inactive form of the immortality virus).
</li><li> Also, the Vampire Elder Viktor seems to have only reproduced once. There doesn't seem to be any reason for it other than the fact that, being immortal, he doesn't really have to worry about a silly thing like an heir.
</li><li> Its shown that vampires are actually capable to reproducing naturally with several being established to be born naturally such as David and Lena. They are even capable of breeding with lycans and producing hybrid children such as Selene (vampire/Immortal hybrid) and Michael (half-Lycan/half-vampire hybrid) giving birth to tri-blooded hybrid Eve.

Ultimately, either interpretation is valid.

As a result, children are treasured by both the Unseighlie and Seighlie Sidhe, although only the Seighlie expand this love to human children and try to save them from unpleasant fates.
<ul><li> For the elves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheObsidianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheObsidianTrilogy">The Obsidian Trilogy</a>, children are also very rare and precious.
</li></ul></li><li> Vampires from Meyers's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> were believed to be infertile, but it turns out that this only applies to the females. So the guys can still get it on with a human girl, but it's incredibly dangerous for the human woman.
<ul><li> The same for wolves (though they're really only immortal so long as they shape shift). While there's only been one female wolf, she appears to have become menopausal after she became a wolf. The males can all still have children, a fact which is publicly known because of imprinting.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar situation holds for the werewolves in Patricia Briggs's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> novels. The werewolves don't age (and if they were old when they were turned, they'll revert to looking adult, but permanently young and fit). Male werewolves can have children with ordinary women, but they'll be born mortal, and there's a high risk of miscarriage. Female werewolves can get pregnant, but inevitably miscarry when they change, which they must do at full moon. The only exception is Charles, the son of the Marrok, who is the offspring of two werewolves and was born one; his Native American mother used magic to hold off the change, but the effort depleted her strength and she died in childbirth. It's often a plot point that older werewolves often become unstable because they have outlived too many partners and children — in the Briggs 'verse it's dangerous to try to become a werewolf, as you have to be savaged to the point of death and not many survive the process, so they can't automatically turn their wives and children.
<ul><li> Vampires in Briggs's 'verse seem not to reproduce in the usual way as they're not so much immortal as undead; they're literally dead during the day. They remain the same age as when they were turned. However, many of them assume a parental responsibility for new vampires that they have turned, and a vampire seethe acts very much like a big dysfunctional mafia family.
</li><li> Fae, on the other hand, can have children with mortals or with each other, and how "immortal" the children are seems to vary. There are lots of different kinds of fae and not very many of them in total.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Strata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Strata">Strata</a></em>, in which the universal currency is a life-extension treatment. One of the main characters, who is several centuries old, wonders what life would have been like had she been a "short-lifer" and thus able to have children.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk Series</a></em>, where nigh-immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">angels</a> are <em>insanely</em> fertile, to the point where any sexual encounter, even with contraceptives, is nearly sure to result in woman getting pregnant.
</li><li> In Mickey Zucker Reichert's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastOfTheRenshai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastOfTheRenshai">The Renshai Trilogy</a></em> and its sequel <em>The Renshai Chronicles</em>, it's remarked that the Norse Gods are <em>almost</em> completely infertile, and that many of them had a human parent. In the second trilogy, the life cycle of Elves becomes an important plot point: a new elven child can only be born if one of the currently existing elves dies (freeing their soul for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>), so the Elven population can never grow beyond its current numbers. Furthermore, the elf needs to have died of natural causes — any violent death <em>permanently</em> reduces the maximum elven population.

Tolkien</a>'s legendarium, as elves live forever but are perfectly capable of having children. They simply don't choose to do so very often; by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, elves are near the end of a very long-term emigration, sailing away from Middle-Earth when they've grown weary of it, so overpopulation isn't a problem. In the stories set in the earliest time periods, though, there are frequently several generations of a single family living and ruling together, making a mental picture far more difficult than the two-generation Hugo Weaving/Liv Tyler pair in the films! There is also the implication that having children can be very spiritually draining for elves, restricting them from having too many. One elf was so diminished by giving birth that she essentially lost the will to live. The endless lives of elves also means that after a relatively short time, sex becomes boring to them. In his notes at one point, Tolkien indicated that elves do not have children after a certain age. (So, menopause?) Also, Fëanor and Nerdanel had the most children that any elven couple ever had, whereas seven children would be, if anything, low for most fertile human couples if they both lived through the women's child-bearing years in most eras.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18475_6-horrifying-implications-awesome-fantasy-movie-universes.html">6 Horrifying Implications of Awesome Fantasy Movie Universes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> discusses this: "no one in the Elfish kingdom is getting any, anywhere."
</li><li> Also averted with hobbits, who often have large families despite living longer than humans.
</li><li> But played straight with Ents, who live nearly forever but are all male and thus can't reproduce. Presumably wherever the Entwives are they have the opposite problem.
</li><li> Meanwhile (in the final version of the mythology) the even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlderImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlderImmortal">Older Immortal</a> Valar and Maiar don't reproduce at all.

Heinlein</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a>.</em> Many near-immortals live throughout the galaxy and reproduce like bunny rabbits, even if they're 20 centuries old. Their children may also be effectively immortal, depending on what genes they picked up and whether they have access to a rejuvenation clinic. They solve the overpopulation problem by continually colonizing new planets. Justified as reproduction was the entire <em>point</em> of the Howard Families. They were an experiment in human longevity that worked spectacularly well.
<ul><li> It is worth noting that Tellus Secundus, the planet where the story begins, has an unusually high population of near-immortal "Howards" and in consequence has instigated population controls. The planet's chief executive mentions to Lazarus Long that he'll grant an exception to any woman Lazarus feels like having a child with. Lazarus himself is a special case as, being over two thousand years old and born at the start of the Howard experiment, he can claim over 80 percent of the galactic population and over 99 percent of Howards as his descendants to some degree or another.
</li></ul></li><li> Sort of the case in the universe of the novels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnansiBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnansiBoys">Anansi Boys</a></em> with two notable exceptions.

This is a fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Doryn</a> uses and exploits. A lot.
</li><li> In the sci-fi <em>The Declaration</em> by Gemma Malloy, immortality has been made possible. Unfortunately, nobody who "opts-in" is allowed to have children because of this. Any children, or "surpluses," born to people who opt in are sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">group homes</a> and taught that they are worthless beings that do not deserve to exist.
</li><li> Fairies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> (who are not immortal but very long-lived) can only have one child every twenty years; humanity's faster reproduction is actually the main reason it was able to more-or-less take the world from them.
</li><li> Witches in Phillip Pullman's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> trilogy live roughly a thousand years. They take human men for lovers and bear children; if the children are girls, they're witches and if boys, human and short-lived. Presumably, they don't have children especially often. One character suggests that a witch dies when her heart is so broken from watching her lovers and sons grow old and die that she can't go on.
</li><li> Straightforwardly stated in C.S. Friedman's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMadnessSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMadnessSeason">The Madness Season</a>.</em> The vampires of that book are only fertile when they subsist on a diet of <em>willingly provided</em> human blood. This is explained in-text as an evolutionary mechanism to keep them from reproducing in an environment that isn't willing to support new vampires.
<ul><li> The Marra, as well, are subject to this. Energy beings who are not able to die but can also not create new Marra (or, if they can, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges">forgotten how</a>)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a> generally discourages having more than a few children but no one stops those who wants dozens. Given that they have unlimited resources it's not really a problem.
</li><li> Averted in Wen Spencer's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tinker">Tinker</a>" series. The Oni are immortal and breed like mice. Famines are common in the Oni's overpopulated world. The Elves on the other hand are just as fertile as humans but don't feel the need to have as many children since they are immortal. The population of Elfland has dropped by 50% over the last two thousand years due to war, accidental death, and suicide.
</li><li> Unicorns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastUnicorn">The Last Unicorn</a></em> (immortal but can be killed) live solitary lives in separate forests and mate very rarely.

They plant some seeds they bring with them to grow food, and the seeds of a salad plant known as ambrosia grow practically overnight. After eating a salad made from ambrosia, they suddenly fall ill and wake up young and immortal. Somehow, an alien plant has acquired entirely new properties on Earth. They make a few locals immortal as well and establish themselves as gods on the island. While the females who become immortal are incapable of conceiving a child, this is absolutely not the case for any immortal male who sleeps with a human woman. That is, in fact, the cause of the many hair colors modern humans have. The original humans all had dark hair, while the Olympians (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">those Olympians</a>; they also call their island <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> after Atl, their home country on Oll) are all redheads. Immortality can only be achieved through consuming a sufficient quantity of ambrosia, which withered and died soon after blooming.
<ul><li> The Ollans have managed to dry and preserve some ambrosia leaves. One of them is awakened by a Russian man after centuries in stasis. In return, she gives him a full dose. However, he decides to only take half of it and keep the other half for later. The half only heals his grave wounds and extends his life but doesn't turn him young or stop his aging. Later, he gives the other half to the protagonist's friend, who has lost a leg during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The leg grows back overnight.

Oh, and the most likable group, the ones who learn English and talk to the humans of the series? They're sterile hybrids. They die after 25 years or so.

Jagi Lamplighter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter">Prospero's Daughter</a></em> trilogy, since the immortality comes from an external source, they are fertile and most have had dozens of children. But the source is not extended to the children or spouses, and so some swore off it.

<ul><li> The Elves of usually live around 500 years, looking young until the last year or two of this, but have very few children during this time. Dallandra discusses the low elven birth rate with Cal and some other elves. It's hypothesized it's not just the length of their lives that restrict their birth rate, it's that part of their diet is meat, and meat-eating animals generally have a comparatively low birth rate. She also compares having children with humans as trading in some of their race's lifespan to have more children.
</li><li> Dwarves are also very long lived. Otho lives at <em>least</em> 400 years. Combined with their legendary stubbornness, it makes it very hard for them to let go of grudges.

<ul><li> The Elves breed much more slowly than humans, because their women ovulate once in a couple of years (or even tens of years). Not to mention that after a hundred or so years, the sex gets boring. It's also mentioned they're only fertile at young age, but as later in the books a girl is bred with an elf over 500, it's probably only the women.
</li><li> Witchers themselves. Thanks to the mutagens that give them their abilities, they live very long lives, but are unable to procreate. Therefore, they have to recruit children from outside, since they can't just breed new witchers.
</li><li> Sorcerers are generally sterile after their training, though there are a few exceptions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Geralt's mother, for example.</span>

However, this also means they are highly unlikely to have children until they are well in their 40s or even 50s. This could indicate a slower rate of maturity.
<ul><li> However, once able to have children, they usually have at least 2. One is noted to have 3 children of her own and then adopting 3 more (keeping a promise she makes at one point).
</li><li> One of the advantages the humans have over the Faata is their numbers and reproductive ability. Despite centuries of genetic engineering, the Faata still haven't figured out how to grow their race at a rate even approaching that of the humans. It also doesn't help that they deliberately engineer their lower castes to have a lifespan measuring only a few years, further reducing their population growth, despite the fact that they have a whole caste of breeders who are artificially inseminated and whose gestation is accelerated to a matter of weeks.
</li><li> This also applies to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Metamorphs</a>, whose lifespans are measured in millennia. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>, they reproduce by having several individuals fertilize one of them, which starts the budding process. It's mentioned by the Exile that his parent may or may not have another child, as births are a very rare occurrence for them.

In fact, the titular character, being quite possibly the oldest human alive (being born in pre-CR days on Earth), has hundreds of thousands of children, although he explains that he didn't technically father any of them save one (his first daughter with his first wife), as they're all the result of artificial insemination with his sperm donated on many planets. However, this trope is, technically, preserved in that the CR treatment is not passed down to children and must be reapplied to everyone once they reach the age they want to be "frozen" in (most choose early 20s, although some prefer ealy 30s).

White Court vampires <em>can</em> avoid activation by having their first sexual encounter with someone they love, which essentially kills the demon inside them and renders them mortal.

About two hundred of them fled to the Dragon's Isle five thousand years ago and never increased their numbers. One observes with frustration that they <em>should</em> have increased, but the species seems demoralized and getting more so. There are fewer mated pairs and even fewer births happening all the time. It's mentioned with great concern that there have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">only three births in the past eight hundred years</a> — and the Kantri with their huge claws are helpless in the face of complications of birth.

This is why many Others avoid having children, so that they don't have to watch them grow old and die. The Others aren't, technically, immortal, but even the weakest of them can enjoy several centuries of life. The most powerful ones tend to be thousands of years old and not look it. The vampires and werewolves are the exception, as they're able to "initiate" (i.e. bite) their children to turn them. However, vampires and werewolves are the lowers rungs of the Dark Others and are viewed at with little more than disdain. The Light ones see them as nothing more than beasts, while the higher Dark ones consider them cannon fodder. Additionally, they can only feed on humans with a license granted by the Night Watch. Doing so without one is punishable by death.
<ul><li> Additionally, vampires can only have one child after being turned, at which point their reproductive ability disappears. Nothing of the sort is mentioned for werewolves, but then the author can't seem to decide if they're undead or not.

</li><li> Amy Thomson said in <a class="urllink" href="http://io9.com/355206/amy-thomson-gives-good-alien">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that "I believe that societies whose individuals have immensely long lifespans, must either have very few young, resulting in a stagnant, inflexible, rigid culture, or else they must place cultural limits on lifespan in order to have the cultural renewal of a younger generation." She chose the latter, so while both the Tendu and the harsels in her books can theoretically live forever if not killed... they don't. Harsels choose to reproduce and die in the act of giving birth to hundreds of nonsentient harlings, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction">chew their way out of their mother's flesh</a>. Tendu spawn in huge numbers throughout their lives, but they <em>eat</em> their nonsentient young, or otherwise are not concerned by animals eating them. Most adult Tendu select one nonsentient subadult and cause it to metamorphose into an adult which is then cared for and taught, and choose to die soon after this child/apprentice is fully mature; there are a few individuals who choose not to die, and then they are culturally compelled to leave home forever and metamorphose again, becoming sort of wandering judges/problem solvers. This is portrayed as more frightening than death. It's mentioned that there was a time when they did things differently and the ecology was absolutely swamped with Tendu, and there weren't enough resources for everyone.
</li><li> Both averted and justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>. Vampires are perfectly capable of reproducing, through both the bite and the normal way, but they seldom <em>want</em> to because it means more competition for food. Even worse, the vampire parents usually expect their offspring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">remain their loving, obedient children for all eternity</a>. This does not go over well with the kids.

This is actually a problem in the setting, as only humans with some degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">aurenfaie</a> blood can have magic powers and the Aurenfaie have been very isolationist for the last few centuries. So the number of wizards is slowly dwindling, and this is becoming a military disadvatage for the main culture in the story. The royal family, who have an Aurenfaie ancestor a few generations back, live about twice as long as pure humans and most of them can reproduce, though. On the other hand, they don't appear to have any magic talents. The Aurenfaie themselves live 300-400 years and are fertile (the family the reader learns most about had at least 4 children before the mother died) but despite occupying a limited territory, they don't appear to have any population problem. This may be because they don't allow a youngster to marry until he or she is well on their way to their 100th birthday, even though they develop a sex drive somewhere around the age of 20.

Thus, when the protagonists arrive, it's been over 200 years since the plague, and the world still looks like it's in the middle of 18th century with almost no progress having been made, except with animatronics, which are used to make child-like automatons that the immortals can pretend to be children.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>, vampires cannot procreate. This actually comes up when Elena wonders whether, supposing Katherine was her ancestor, she was part vampire. Damon shoots this down and says that if Katherine had any children, it was before she became a vampire. Although Klaus, the Original Hybrid, can have children thanks to a loophole. In matters of procreation, his werewolf side trumps the vampire side. His daughter Hope is a tribrid (vampire, witch, and werewolf) and it's assumed she has the same loophole. Other vampire and werewolf hybrids don't seem to have this ability though.

<ul><li> The lifespan of elves has decreased somewhat over the various editions (from a maximum of two thousand years for grey elves in 1st edition to a handful of centuries now); perhaps this is appropriate, considering that they've become more and more common in their game worlds, suggesting higher levels of procreation. Their pregnancies are still long, and they need to wait five years to get pregnant again.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fp8j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fp8j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fp8j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>The Book of Erotic Fantasy</em> has it that elven pregnancies last a full <em>two years</em>, which does a number on the mother's body.</span>

</li><li> Completely averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons</a>, however, which are some of the longest-lived beings in <em>D&amp;D</em>. The only issue with them is that after a certain point in their lives females stop being fertile, and mortality rate is relatively high amongst younger dragons, so they're not overrunning the world.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>: Neothelids are technically mortal creatures, but are functionally immortal insofar as most other races are concerned — their lifespans are measured in the tens of millennia — and magic can easily allow them to transcend their own theoretical mortality as well. This is offset by a glacial birth rate, as neothelids are born very, very rarely. This is a significant problem for them, as they have effectively no ability to absorb losses in population and the death of even a single neothelid is a disaster, and as they simply cannot keep up with the rapidly swelling numbers of more short-lived species.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fluff and lore about Space Marines and whether or not they can even sire children, much less raise them, is very vague and ill-defined, but given the massive physiological changes a baseline human goes through to become an Astartes, along with his psychological conditioning and the simple fact of Marines being created specifically as soldiers, it's <em>very</em> unlikely that any would have kids.
</li><li> The Eldar combine a low birth rate with a natural aversion towards any sort of extreme emotion (an Eldar having sex is practically begging to get his soul sucked out by Slaanesh), to the point where their population is likely just below sustainability levels. It's also stated that Eldar pregnancies are long and complicated exactly due to them being such a highly-developed species that can afford little in the way of mistakes, which makes things only worse. This probably has something to do with the fact that they were originally created by the Old Ones to fight the Necrons and reproducing naturally wasn't high on their priority list.
</li><li> Played with by the Dark Eldar. They can indeed reproduce, but the majority of Dark Eldar are vat-grown clones (which serve as mooks in combat or spare bodies in experiments) which are only sub-par (allegedly) in combat skill but otherwise differ little from actual Dark Eldar. Dark Eldar literally feed on pain and uses this to extend their lifespans. Asdrubael Vect, Archon of the largest Dark Eldar Cabal, is currently the oldest living being in the universe, bar the Chaos Gods and Necrons. Having natural "True-born" children is a privilege reserved for the upper-echelons of Dark Eldar society.
</li><li> The Necrons gained immortality by being transformed into robots, which obviously presents a rather insurmountable obstacle to reproduction. In fact their (active) population is not particularly high, yet can war with other races with little issue because any "killed" Necrons are immediately teleported back to their base and repaired by automated systems.
</li><li> In early editions, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> had fathered quite a few children in his 39,000 years. Known as the Sensei, they were also immortals with psychic powers, and were hunted down by the Inquisition either to make more psyk-out weapons or to sacrifice them to jump-start the Emperor.
</li><li> The Orks, by contrast, are an object lesson in the disastrous effects of averting this trope. Orks don't die of old age and are constantly shedding spores to grow more Orks and related organisms. As a result they are the most populous race in the entire galaxy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">an ever present threat to humanity and the other races</a>. The only reason they haven't conquered the universe yet is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">their infamous compulsion to immediately start fighting each other the minute they run out of enemies</a>.

<ul><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Tzeentch</a>. The ancient race of Dragon Ogres asked the Lord of Change for a boon, to make them immortal. He did, but also rendered them sterile. Most of the still-living Dragon Ogres consider this to be Tzeench's idea of a joke.
</li><li> The Slann, the rulers of the Lizardmen, do not seem to be able to die of old age (the oldest are old enough to remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Old Ones</a>), but there have been no new spawnings of Slann since the disappearance of the Old Ones some eight thousand years before the present day. None of the Lizardmen species in Warhammer breeds in a sexual manner, their eggs simply come into being in magical spawning pools deep in the Lustrian jungles — each new spawning occurring according to the (now much fragmented) plan of the Old Ones. But the Old Ones didn't plan on needing more than five generations of Slann, and there is nothing the Slann themselves can do to increase their numbers, so they are now a dying race, and the loss of even one is an incalculable blow (See Warhammer: Lizardmen (2013), p. 31).
</li><li> Elves can live for thousands of years, but produce so few children that they are slowly declining and dying out. Warhammer's Dwarfs live for hundreds of years, and seem to breed at far below replacement levels as well. Meanwhile short-lived humans breed at human-normal rates and the rat-like Skaven, the vast majority of whom never live past twenty, breed in huge numbers like the swarms of vermin they are.
</li><li> The Undead, including Vampires, are completely unable to reproduce. Except by raising more corpses with magic.

Maturing within seconds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">very fertile</a>, and immortal, they will easily max out your population no matter what population limit you choose.

The former due to sterility as a side effect of FEV perceiving the 23 chromosomes in sex cells as "damaged" and "repairing" them by filling in the missing chromosomes, and the latter... radiation sterility and, well... rot?
<ul><li> Van Buren would have had "born ghouls," children born into ghouldom. To Drs. Sebastian and Clark, the masterminds of the breeding program, the born ghouls represent the future of the ghoul "species."

<ul><li> Initially averted, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a>, with the krogan.

However, while their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> homeworld kept their numbers in check, once they were colonizing more pastoral worlds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">their population exploded in a single generation</a>. To stop the Krogan Rebellions, the entire species was infected with a virus that devastates their birth rate (1 out of 1000 is live, the rest are stillborn). Even with the high mortality rate, they'd still be capable of maintaining a population equilibrium if not for the species wide fatalism that followed the genophage (kind of hard to keep your chin up when your contemporaries annihilate a fundamental aspect of your biology and society).
</li><li> The asari, who live for one thousand years, don't seem to have a problem with this trope. They happily breed all they want to. On the other hand, in order to become pregnant, the asari has to be consciously trying to become pregnant. They can have sex all they want and only reproduce when they have a desire to. The asari, of course, are an entire race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">Blue Skinned Space Babes</a>, which probably rejiggers their place on the immortality vs. fertility continuum. Most of the time, the asari don't choose to procreate until they pass their 300th birthday and become Matrons, and generally don't have that many children in their whole lifetime; nearly 1000-year old Matriarch Benezia only has one daughter, for example. Aethyta, who's as old, is implied to have had a good number, but her father was a krogan.

They did not even have enough children to replace the members they lost, so the birth of Arcueid itself was pretty big news even before people knew how powerful she was. Possibly tied to the fact that they were almost entirely all male.

Elves mature and reproduce at the same rate as humans, but have no upper limit to their ages.

Zombies and Servo robots are immortal but cannot have children, while Vampires can reproduce, but any children born will be completely normal.
<ul><li> In <em>The Sims 3</em> Vampires are no longer immortal (though they still live much longer then regular sims), and can have children at the same rate as ordinary Sims at least in theory although only half of their children with an ordinary Sim will be Vampires. Also, the Fairy Sims in the Supernatural expansion have the same lifespan as Vampires, and can likewise reproduce at the same rate as ordinary Sims. Both also age at the same rate as ordinary Sims until they reach adulthood.

(<em>Exactly</em> how much longer they live is inconsistent throughout the lore, and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> when brought up, but there are plenty of (non-magically enhanced) examples living 200, 300, or even 500 years without it being seen as too unusual.) However, the races of Mer are also implied to have far fewer children as a result, with some sources even indicating that there may be a "cap" on the amount of children a Mer woman can have in her lifetime (with few ever having more than three). Additionally, their chances of having children are higher if they take a non-Mer lover. (For example, the Bretons are an entire race of Mer/Man hybrids who eventually outbred both of their parent races in the region of High Rock.

They are also stated to be "not a prolific people"; even before the events of the first game, the Protoss' population was steadily declining, as they were dying of old age faster than they could bear new children. The Fall of Aiur, with the resulting tremendous fatality count, worsened the situation.

<ul><li> Cubi Clans are led by a Tri-winged Succubus or Incubus, who are as close to immortal as one can get with a an ungodly long lifespan and are so powerful very few dare to challenge them. The catch is they cannot have children of their own, and while it is possible to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1222.php">convert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> non-blood relatives to their clan there must be at least one fertile member of the clan alive who has had a child with the prospective member. The character Fa'lina shows how this can be bad, being a clan leader and being the last surviving member of said clan.
</li><li> In addition to Cubi, no new members of the Fae race may be born until living members willingly and deliberately die. They can have children with just about anything, but, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.missmab.com/Demo/HG06.php">well...<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The problem is that the fae race has only so many souls to go around, and nothing can be done to increase that number. That's why a fae has to die before a new one can be born — the dying fae's soul is reincarnated in the newborn fae.
</li><li> Destania's clan leader Cyra is in a similar boat as Fa'lina. Destania is her <em>last</em> surviving "child" and she can't even speak with her anymore since Destania has given up dreaming — and Cyra mostly communicates in dreams. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So she's absolutely <em>thrilled</em> when she gets the chance to <a class="urllink" href="http://missmab.com/Comics/Vol_1002.php">speak with her "grandson" Dan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>.

In the wake of the Errant Wars, the elven fertility rate seems to have dropped from "low" to "zero," as the last elven child born is now some 1,500 years old. <br/><br/>When <a class="urllink" href="http://www.errantstory.com/2010-07-12/4871">Meji finally starts 'talking' with Senilus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the things she learns is that the something went wrong when the 'gods' made one of the races; the race would lose the ability to reproduce itself after 427 generations. Since the first two races the 'gods' made weren't <em>able</em> to reproduce, and the last race made by the gods is generally agreed to be the trolls, it is very strongly indicated that the race in question is the elves. <em>But</em> they are still fertile with humans, since errant Meji is only 17, and errants can be very long-lived. The elves originally took advantage of this to increase their population, until one powerful errant mage went mad for some reason and went on a rampage. The elves thought it was an inherent problem with errants and forbade future errant births.

As a result, the Elves invented prophylactics before they discovered how to use fire.

Meanwhile Diva'ratrika Val'Sharen is over a thousand and has only had five (surviving) daughters and one son, which the suggestion that politics has played a role in this. Meanwhile, during a 15 year timeskip, Mel'arnach has three children, which suggests fae are able to have multiple kids within a short amount of time with relatively little trouble, and drow in particular elevate motherhood to a sacred level, with one character's <em>losing</em> her ability to have more children playing a critical role in her motivations and actions. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> nature of the environment means that despite people having lots of kids the population has stayed relatively stable due to the high chance of death.

Also, the biological clock normally doesnt start ticking until a few millennia, eliminating the desire to have children for quite a while. Enchanters who have children while theyre still relatively young, or have more then one, are typically frowned upon.

Most do not seem to do so, though. "Half-Immortals" (called "elves" in the series jargon), the offspring of an Immortal and an ordinary human, are confirmed to be sterile. No word on what happens if two Immortals attempt procreation.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's later confirmed that elves are <em>not</em>, in fact, sterile, though they <em>are</em> less likely to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant than a normal human. The sterility is deliberate misinformation the Immortals pass on to their reset selves, in part so they can avoid attachments to extended families after resetting. Jerry's reset version only knows this at all because Jerry wanted him to be a responsible successor, and Pandora only learned the truth relatively recently herself, with it being confirmed that Susan and Diane are descended from Raven</span>.

The majority of Servant species can live forever unless killed, and seem to vary between fairly low fertility, and something that is about normal for humans. Then there are goblins, a species of Servant that was created to fulfil a task that would have a high mortality rate, meaning that they reproduce at an extremely high rate; since they no longer do that job, they greatly outnumber virtually every other race in the multiverse, meaning that their clans are very well represented amongst the businesses and criminal enterprises that run everything.
<ul><li> Results vary for the Demiurges ruling over this mess; Jadis is sealed in a stone slab and suicidal, so analog reproduction is out the window. Solomon has thousands, if not millions, of mortal sons who have been general disappointments, while Gog-Agog is a sentient colony of worms so she has a tide of her 'babies' infesting various minions across the multiverse, but all of them can be classified as 'limbs', 'toys', or 'food'.

<ul><li> Celestia and Luna seem to follow this trope. Their personal lack of children could just be because they've never had mates, but they have both lived at least a thousand years, possibly much longer, and their only onscreen relatives are a niece and a nephew (and presumably their offscreen relatives). The existence of Age spells only accessible to really powerful unicorns further complicates things, as their immortality may not even be natural. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Said niece and nephew aren't even blood relatives. As far as we know, the sisters have no other living relatives.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters">The Journal of the Two Sisters</a></em> implies that natural alicorns, as opposed to ponies changed via magic, are apparently a very rare and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a> pony race.

The only reason Poof exists is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">no one forbade their godchildren from wishing for them</a>.
<ul><li> More accurately, Jorgen keeps forgetting to implement that rule, so it's possible that there may have been more Fairy babies brought into life (explaining Poof's peers in nursery school.) Poof seems to be a big case because of who his parents and godbrother are.

<ul><li> Averted with amoebae, and other single celled organisms that reproduce by binary fission. When you split in half (as opposed to budding off a daughter cell), you can consider both resulting amoebae to be an extension of the life of the parent. In short, every single amoeba on the planet is the very first amoeba. They're immortal and reproduce like crazy. Good thing they're fairly low on the food chain, so their hypothetical immortality isn't much of a problem.
</li><li> Throughout history people have attempted to discover the secret to eternal life and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey">Aubrey De Grey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is probably the most famous example in modern science. He has come up with his own theories and has even gone so far as to speculate that, once technology can stop and reverse aging, people will have to file a form to have children and then wait for other people to die (through natural causes or requested suicide) to be given the go-ahead.
</li><li> Thought experiments on population growth rates suggest that extending lifespan needn't necessarily produce an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">Explosive Breeder</a>, as it's really the age <em>at first reproduction</em> that determines how fast a population grows. Mathematically, having a breeding female live forever will do less to increase birth rates than having her produce a daughter (who'll breed early in turn) slightly sooner.
</li><li> This idea is truth in television in human communities insomuch as the childbirth rate of a country appears to be inversely related to its average lifespan. This is attributed to things like education, not seeing everyone around you die young (which tends to cause survivor lust), and good healthcare that improves lifespans and reduces infant mortality, meaning people don't need to have as many children to guarantee some survive. More developed countries also tend to have less of a primary-industry focus, meaning children are a net drain on assets rather than a source of income. State welfare and wealth in general also means parents aren't as reliant on children to support them in their old age.
</li><li> Because human oocytes (eggs) are produced by a woman's ovaries before she, herself, is born, an immortal woman's capacity for natural reproduction would inevitably expire when her supply runs out, even if she never goes through menopause (assuming the science at some point won't be able to reboot the ova production mechanism, of course). She could, however, give birth to a baby conceived <em>in vitro</em> from a donor egg.
<ul><li> This has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">recently</a> been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nature.com/news/egg-making-stem-cells-found-in-adult-ovaries-1.10121">the discovery of egg-producing stem cells<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (so-called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogonium#Oogonial_stem_cells">oogonial stem cells<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) in adult women's ovaries. Regardless of this, menopause obviously still renders women infertile.
</li><li> There are also services now that preserve a woman's eggs in case she doesn't have a baby before menopause. This is the same as the process mentioned above with the only difference is that it's still her own baby.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18471_5-animals-that-are-terrifyingly-hard-to-kill_p2.html">immortal jellyfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doesn't die; it turns back into a baby and starts over.
