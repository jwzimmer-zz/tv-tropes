The trope gets played with, as Ainz was completely aware that would happen, despite his station requiring him to hand out discipline, he feels like the above spoiler was his fault.

</li><li> One comic relates the founding of Australia as a penal colony by imitating a griping English criminal who can't believe he's being shipped off to some godforsaken island halfway around the world for stealing a loaf of bread. Then the prison ship passes Bondi Beach, a beautiful stretch of beach that is today one of the most popular and well-known places in Australian to visit. "Lemme get this straight... I steal a loaf of bread, and I get to spend the rest of my life on that beach?" And 200 convicts go, "Hell, yeah!"

Kirk specifically "orders" Scotty to go along in order to keep the lower-ranked men from starting trouble with visiting Klingons. Instead, it is Scott himself who starts a brawl with those self-same Klingons. This sparks the following exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kirk:</strong> Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice. <br/><strong>Scotty:</strong> Yes, sir. <em>[smiling]</em> Thank you, sir! That'll give me a chance to catch up on me technical journals!

Also, Scotty is almost immediately seen back out working again; it's not stated but likely that Kirk realizes how pointless it all is.

All along, Ma Parker had been infiltrating the prison with criminals posing as cops, until the warden had been the only legitimate lawman left; once he was out of the way too, Ma declared herself the new warden and let all the inmates have total run of the place.

The penalty is five yards. There are some occasions, though, when a team will intentionally get flagged for delay of game because they want to back up five yards to give their punter more space to punt the ball deep in the "coffin corner" (as close to the opponent's goal line as possible without crossing it - a punted ball that touches the end zone is called as a touchback and the opponent will get the ball at their own 20-yard-line). Usually this is when the offense stalls on their opponent's side of the field but not close enough to try a field goal and the line to gain is too far. It's becoming less common, though, as the opposing teams are beginning to decline the distance penalty.
</li><li> Los Angeles Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen was trying to nail down the final outs of a 5-3 game against the Chicago Cubs on June 15, 2019. The Cubs had Jason Heyward on second base, a prime position for him to steal signs, and Heyward makes a feint towards third while Jansen's looking at him to try to bait him into a balk. Jansen doesn't bite, and after getting the strikeout to get the second out of the 9th inning he goes back to the rubber and, finally sick of being distracted by Heyward at second, intentionally commits a balk to send Heyward to third base, which was fine for Jansen as, in that situation, there was basically no difference scoring-potential-wise in putting Heyward at third while allowing Jansen to concentrate on getting the final out, which he did. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJaIoryOXYw">See a commentated overview here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsefulNotes">Useful Notes</a>/basketball, there are multiple unishments related to fouls and freethrows.
<ul><li> While a foul call in "bonus" situation can provide free throws for the offended team, it also terminates their possession of the ball returning the fouling team the ball. Therefore it is a common strategy for a team trailing by a few points in the score to spend the final minute or two seeking to foul as quickly as possible to get more opportunities to score. When a team has committed so few fouls that the "bonus" is not yet in effect, they commit additional fouls ("They have two fouls to give") just to set up this strategy.
</li><li> When an opposing team has a player with a notoriously poor free throw shooting record, the opponents will deliberately foul that player at any time they are in "bonus" because - on average they will give up less points with two iffy foul shots than one regular shot. Frequent use against Shaquille O'Neal earned the strategy the name <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-a-Shaq">"Hack a Shaq"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as well as making Shaq the player with most free throws in playoffs. However the most extreme use was in 1997 when Bubba Wells fouled Dennis Rodman six times in three minutes, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scWfUFtwXGs">setting an NBA record for fastest ejection on six fouls<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. To avoid combining these strategies, coaches may bench their worst shooters in closing minutes of a game.
</li><li> "Foul up three" is used when a team leading by three would rather allow two free throws rather than risk giving up a three point foul. <a class="urllink" href="https://kenpom.com/blog/yet-another-study-about-fouling-when-up-3/">Statisticians doubt the effectiveness of this strategy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Minor infractions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a> are punished by having the individual offender sit in the penalty box while the opposing team's power play units (five skaters at a time) play against the offending team's penalty kill units (four skaters at a time). How effective that is as a punishment depends greatly on the relative abilities of the power play and penalty kill units. During the 1980's, the Edmonton Oilers had such a potent goal-scoring roster that they would frequently have one player start fights on purpose so that both sides would play 4-on-4 hockey, which opened up the ice for the remaining four skaters and gave them an easier time in scoring goals — it got to the point that the NHL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">changed the rules</a> so that fighting majors would still have the two sides play 5-on-5 with each participant still in the box.
</li><li> The 1993-94 New York Rangers had, amongst their roster, hotshot winger Alexei Kovalev. One game in February saw him stay out on the ice longer than he was supposed to — a hallmark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a> superstar move — so strict disciplinarian coach Mike Keenan forbade him from returning to the bench for the next shift... then the next shift... then the next shift... all the way to the end of the period.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17fc5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17fc5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17fc5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Individual ice time wasn't kept back then, so depending on sources the exact amount of time Kovalev stayed on the ice was somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes — save for goalies, shifts rarely last longer than one minute lest the player collapse in fatigue and cramps</span>. Apparently, Kovalev concluded exactly the opposite of what Keenan intended and thought that he was being rewarded for good play, and at any rate, he did score a goal in that super-long shift.
</li><li> This is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in sports events, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a>. It occurs multiple times that a player is one yellow card away for getting a suspension for the next match, but that following match is actually meaningless. For example in the case of a round robin stage where the team already qualified for the next round, but they still have one match to play in the group. The player deliberately commits a foul that results in a yellow card. The player is then suspended for the next, meaningless, match. After he sits out his suspension he can begin again with a clean slate. However, the governing bodies regularly see through these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">acts</a> and suspend the player and/or coaches for additional matches due to unsportsmanlike conduct.

Two of the other characters are clearly suffering punishment for the things they've done. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eddie is punished by being faced with the visages of all the people who have tormented him throughout his life.

</li><li> Ignus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>. He was an insane pyromaniac mage who burnt down half of the Hive. His punishment? Being turned into a living conduit for the Elemental Plane of Fire, giving him even better ability to burn stuff. In fact, the only part of the punishment that worked was that it made him so <em>happy</em> that he was content to remain floating in one place in reverie, not causing problems for anyone... Until The Nameless One comes along.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> has a few, both from the original lore and the modern lore:
<ul><li> Soraka's original, Journal of Justice-era lore involved trying to punish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mercenary alchemist</a> Warwick through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation">Karmic Transformation</a>, which turned him into a bloodthirsty werewolf. While this seemingly did strip him of his scientific knowledge, he instead had way too much fun using his new form to rip people apart to care. He was already a sadistic monster; she basically gave him the ability to indulge his appetites directly. Their lore after that (but prior to future retcons to both characters that permanently removed their association) makes this a bit more of an actual curse, as Warwick will eventually fully become a mindless beast unless he devours Soraka's heart.
<ul><li> Warwick's current lore, where he's an alchemical hybrid in the shape of a werewolf, zig-zags this a bit. He seems to be resigned to his "curse," the result of the alchemist Singed trying to bring out his "beast within" literally, but appreciates the knowledge of his "true nature" as a killer and the ability to hunt other killers.
</li></ul></li><li> Prior to the Institute of War retcon, Cassiopeia was a Noxian spy who specialized in seduction for information, but when she broke an oath of secrecy to a Freljordian diplomat she wound up turning into a naga. Because of her position as a noble's daughter she faced no shame or shunning from Noxian society, and upon finding out that her new form came with extremely toxic poison and a petrifying glare, the Noxian army gave her a new position as an assassin and eventually a Champion, which was easily one of the greatest honors a Noxian can obtain aside from high military rank.
<ul><li> In the current lore her transformation was caused by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Shuriman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">security system</a>, the result of a desperate gambit to claim the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Ascension</a> for the Black Rose cabal. Like Warwick, she has mixed feelings about the transformation—at first, she absolutely despised it, and there are still signs that she doesn't entirely approve of her new form. But the chance to use that power to serve the Black Rose and simply *take* what she wants directly instead of having to scheme for it is proving quite appealing...
</li></ul></li><li> For an example from the modern lore, the revenant-warlord Mordekaiser deliberately planned to be defeated. When his spirit was severed from his iron armor by a rebellion whose decendants would later found Noxus, the souls of his empire remained in the realm of the dead, unfading—letting him forge a new empire of the dead there, an afterworld where souls would remain under his dominion eternally. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">He seems to also be ready to come *back* to the realm of the living, and it's implied he's about to do so in the heart of Noxus itself...</a></span>
</li><li> Another, more heroic modern lore example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">Taric</a>, whose appreciation for the world's beauty ended up leading to his men getting slaughtered by Void monsters while off admiring a temple, was exiled to climb Mount Targon. While most people used this as a chance to start a new life in exile, Taric took the chance to atone for his mistake seriously. His successful climb led to him becoming the Aspect of the Protector, giving him the ability to guard the entire world and its beauty alike.
</li><li> During the story <a class="urllink" href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/confessions-of-a-broken-blade-act-1-story/">Confessions of a Broken Blade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Riven, a Noxian ex-soldier and expatriate haunted by her past, now living in Ionia, is accused of killing an elder and must stand trial as a result. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As it turns out, both her and Yasuo, who had also been accused of killing said elder in the past, played roles in the elder's death—Riven's runeblade accidentally fragmented as a freak result of exposure to wind magic, while Yasuo could have prevented the blade-shrapnel from being lethal had he been there to guard said elder. In the end, seeing the death was accidental and Riven's honest desire to atone, the judge sentences her to hard labor—working the fields of her adopted Ionian parent-figures (which she'd been doing prior to her trial), and repairing damage to both the courthouse and homes damaged by the Noxian invasion. Riven, appreciating the chance to redeem herself and earn the mercy she's been offered, accepts.</span>
</li><li> Senna, trapped in the lantern of the spectral torturer Thresh, ended up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">managing to be the only soul to successfully pull this off against him, as well as the only soul to ever escape his grasp outright. Her unique abilities allowed her spirit to not only survive within the lantern, but also to find out new information from the other souls trapped inside. When her husband Lucian finally managed to free her from the lantern, she also escaped with a relic cannon that could channel both light and shadow.</span> Technically zigzagged in that she was still tormented by Lucian's repeated attempts to rescue her, risking his life and freedom repeatedly to either save her or bring her to rest.

<ul><li> The episode "The Son That Got Away" has Bobby (and Connie) disrupting their music class, and Hank decides to punish Bobby by making him clean the rain gutters. He later finds out Bill and Dale took the job from Bobby out of personal satisfaction.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill:</strong> You say punishment, I call it funishment.
</div></li><li> In the same episode, Hank berates Kahn for making Connie mow the lawn, thinking of that as a privilege.
</li><li> Also in the episode where Hank makes Bobby get a job during the summer instead of stay in his room playing video games the entire break. He gets a job working for Strickland and almost gets into a lot of trouble. So after Hank rescues both of them he tells Bobby his punishment for all of this is that he is grounded for the rest of the summer (aka staying in his room). Bobby clearly catches what his father means and thanks him.
</li><li> In another episode, Bobby is punished with summer school because he wrote in his Texas History textbook. Hank is upset, but then he finds out that what Bobby wrote was a speech Hank had given earlier about the Alamo, presenting the bare facts rather than the "pop history" version that depicts the Texans as drunken cowards. Smiling, Hank says that since Bobby has to take summer classes anyway, he might as well skip school the next day and they both take a trip to Six Flags.
</li><li> Averted in the episode "High Anxiety", where Hank allowed Bobby to punish him for accidentally using drugs. Bobby decides to punish Hank by not allowing him to mow the lawn for a week. To almost anyone but Hank this would be an Unishment, but it's a genuine punishment to Hank, who even complains to Bobby that the punishment is too harsh.

<ul><li> Gumball and Darwin throw a bowling ball into the Robinsons' backyard, so Mr. Robinson has them do chores as punishment. Gumball and Darwin do them with gusto, such as raking the leaves, cutting the grass with a nail clipper, and painting his fence repeatedly, which creeps him out.
</li><li> When Nicole assumes Gumball and Darwin have been stealing stuff from around the house, she tells them that they can't come to the museum with the rest of the family, but as it turns out they didn't want to anyway.

Phineas quickly points out that Buford would eat a bug if they <em>merely</em> asked, and he refuses to accept their counter-suggestion unless it also includes eating a bug.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode "Ghoul Fools", Patrick gets sent to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a> where he has a talking donut on his head that he can't eat because when he tries to grab it, it makes the top of his head grow so the donut is out of his reach. Patrick complains that it's a plain donut and makes it turn into different flavors, then asks for it to turn into a stack of pancakes, and then a Krabby Patty before deciding he wants a plain donut again, leading to the donut's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Here Comes the Neighborhood" had an influx of rich (black) people moving into the town causing most of the native poor (white) people to resent their presence to the point that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">passed laws forbidding rich people from mingling with poor people</a>. Much of the episode was actually a subversion, since the rich people were outraged that they were excluded from South Park's blue-collar lifestyle. But on at least one occasion it was played straight: poor people at the back of a bus object to Bill Cosby and his kids sitting down next to them, and the passengers make them sit in the front in much more comfortable chairs. They obey, and then a passenger tries to taunt Cosby by sarcastically remarking how pleasant it must be sitting up there - only for Cosby to sincerely tell him that, yes, in fact, it <em>is</em>.
</li><li> In several episodes, Saddam Hussein is shown to be way too comfortable and happy in Hell, and is even in a sexual relationship with Satan himself. Both Satan and God realize that he's not getting punished as is intended, and the two eventually cooperate to give him a fitting punishment: he's sent to Heaven instead, which is full of people who constantly rope Saddam into social activities he considers boring, making this an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted Trope</a> too.

<ul><li> "Lock-Up" has a particularly ironic example, perhaps even a subverted inversion: Former Arkham Asylum guard Lyle Bolton becomes the psychotic vigilante Lock-Up because he believes that the criminals confined there are not being punished harshly enough. After he starts terrorizing <em>non</em>-criminals too (because they are too "sympathetic" to the criminals), he is straitjacketed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation">put in a cell in Arkham among all the inmates for whom he has such contempt</a>. But Lock-Up is happy about this punishment, because now he can keep an eye on all the lunatics 24 hours a day — blind to the fact that he is now one of them, and that if any of them escape, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">he will be helpless to do anything about it</a>.

Twilight decides to give them an additional "punishment" in the form of growing mustaches on them with one of her magic spells.
</li><li> Starlight Glimmer's punishment for her actions in the season 5 finale "The Cutie Re-mark" is to be made Twilight Sparkle's personal student. However, the Mane Six acknowledge that she is too dangerous and unstable to be left unattended, and that her magic power (which Twilight acknowledges may be on par with or stronger than her own) can be a great benefit to Equestria. It helps that she saw what her actions may lead to, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">didn't like it</a>.

Johnny then had to get home before the sun would come up and Hugh would see that Johnny has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingDummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingDummy">replaced himself in bed with an inflatable decoy</a>.

Subverted when Arthur protests that he likes his desk and doesn't want to argue with them, making Mr. Ratburn send <em>Arthur</em> to Brain's desk.

<ul><li> Schools can be subjected to this quite a bit. Quite often, "punishing" a child who has a different learning style or doesn't care about school will be giving them exactly what they want.
<ul><li> Misbehaving can lead to suspension, which means time away from school. This is why a number of schools have in-school suspensions — effectively, detention by another name but all-day long. However, this can still be Unishment for some because it means they're out of class all day and while they may be given work, they may not exactly be forced to do it. In fact, most ISS teachers really don't care what the students do as long as they're quiet and don't use electronics. Students sometimes even go for this intentionally if they are antisocial or unable to concentrate in a crowd, and so will be given a day of peace to focus on their schoolwork.
</li><li> One American school <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396362,00.html">required violators of dress code to wear prison jumpsuits.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> As you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnItFeelsGoodToBeAGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnItFeelsGoodToBeAGangster">might have expected</a>, many students deliberately violated the dress code just so they could wear these prison jumpsuits.
<div class="indent">"I don't think that jumpsuits are going to work, because my friends actually, instead of it being a punishment, they'll see it as an opportunity to be like, rebels," said Meredith, who also isn't sure whether his hair, dyed bright fire-engine red, will pass muster. "I don't think there's going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school."
</div></li><li> When some schools began to reopen during the Covid-19 pandemic, claiming that they could enforce social distancing without any problems, a student shared pictures of crowded school corridors showing that there was no attempts at social distancing whatsoever. They suspended her, and it not only reduced her risk from catching the virus, but gave her enough free time to tell her sory to any media outlet who wanted it, making the school look worse in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> Played desperately straight with the (US) prison system. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Causes">Some people simply cannot succeed outside of prison, so they keep doing illegal things<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is a major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em>.
</li><li> Drug lord Pablo Escobar arranged to serve his prison sentence in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">a prison he was allowed to design himself and staff with his own guards</a>. Since he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll">able to run his criminal enterprise from in there and it actually served to protect him from assassins</a>, he probably didn't mind too much. Eventually the authorities declared he had to go to a regular facility after he brought some people into his prison to be killed, and Escobar became a fugitive by just walking out the back door.
</li><li> Australia began as a penal colony to remove cons from England's crowded prisons. However, as featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations">Great Expectations</a></em>, if you survived your sentence (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">which was far from guaranteed</a>) then it was quite possible to become very wealthy indeed from the abundant mineral resources and cheap grazing land. And public outcry eventually mitigated the worst excesses of neglect and brutality in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">Transportation</a>, to the point where inmates travelling to Australia on a prison transport were <em>less</em> likely to die at sea than paying passengers; the shipping lines were paid per <em>living</em> prisoner, on arrival.
</li><li> The founding principle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s program of non-violent resistance, <em>Satyagraha</em>, is that the best way to defeat an unjust law is to break it, and then insist on being punished for it, as the forces behind the unjust law and the public that supports them will then have their noses rubbed in just how unjust it is.
</li><li> In March 2014, Utah resident Andrew Wilcox lost a bet to his brother, and had to dance on a busy street intersection for 30 minutes to whatever music his brother chose. He quickly started a dance party which became an internet sensation and got a date out of it. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/12/brother-loses-bet-dance-intersection_n_4948939.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular">Read about it here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> At some speeches about Autism, a few speakers mentioned being told to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandingInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandingInTheHall">go stand in the hall</a> because they were being a disruption. They actually used this as an opportunity to relax. Somewhat subverted in that being told to stand in the hall (or sit in another room) isn't always <em>intended</em> as a punishment — sometimes they just need a bit of time to cool down.
</li><li> Some political criminals of the German Democratic Republic were punished by forcing them to move to West Germany. As a matter of fact, most political prisoners in the GDR were "bought" by West Germany to be released into the West. The GDR was desperate enough for hard currency to ignore the political ramifications of this and West Germany knew enough about East German prisons to want to spare political prisoners that fate. Depending on the decade, this trope was subverted — if Russia felt like it, then the order of the day was to send political criminals to the Gulags in Siberia.
</li><li> Radical labor leader Eugene V. Debs spent much of his incarceration in the prison library reading socialist literature — guaranteeing that once he was released, he would be even <em>more</em> radical.
</li><li> Many small-time criminals in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">Depression-era</a> America actually looked forward to jail, since it offered them some measure of employment, as well as guaranteed meals and a relatively comfortable place to sleep. It was referred to in Depression-era slang as "three hots and a cot".
</li><li> An impressively ineffective boycott strategy: buying an item in bulk in order to destroy it (especially after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, if you intended to show the action on social media). The issue is that the company making the product doesn't really care what you do with their product once you've purchased it. If anything, buying and destroying a product gives the company free publicity, while the people destroying said product come off as immature and petty for giving away their money.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EthanVanSciver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EthanVanSciver">Ethan Van Sciver</a> bought a whole crate of die-cast Rose Tico action figures to destroy them in order to complain about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>. Disney couldn't care less whether Van Sciver intended to give them away as Christmas presents, paint them green and stick them up his nose, or (as actually happened) attempt to cut them in half with scissors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">only to fail because they were clearly marked as die-cast</a>. All that Disney cared about was the bit where Van Sciver bought a whole crate of <em>Star Wars</em> action figures.
</li><li> There was a boycott of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a></em> in which the boycotters went around buying as many copies of other <em>Sonic</em> games as they could find. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>'s financial department wasn't complaining.
</li><li> Something similar occurred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> after John Lennon's infamous "bigger than Jesus" comments; outraged, hordes of outraged Christian fundamentalists organised mass burnings of Beatles records and merchandise. Except, of course, they would have had to buy them first in order to burn them, meaning that as Lennon and the other Beatles would later archly note, it wasn't quite the punishment to them it may have seemed.
</li><li> Book burnings are the first documented cases of this. While many early ones involved forcibly taking the books off the shelves and possibly torching the whole book store or library for carrying it, most modern book burners have to buy the books first. For example, every so often <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf">Mein Kampf</a></em> will sneak it's way onto the best sellers list, mostly because of people buying copies to burn or deface. While Hitler fortunately isn't in a position to collect royalties, it's hardly a punishment to the publishers or stores.
</li></ul></li><li> Scathing reviews and criticisms of a work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticProof">can often boost its sales</a>. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em> was near universally panned and many internet personalities savaged the idea of the film and trailers before it even came out. This may have honestly saved the film, which was deemed as too boring and slow to keep its target demographic occupied (and thus deterring parents from taking them to see it). However plenty of adults went to see the movie to see what all the fuss/cringe was about, resulting in the film being a success.
</li><li> For continual drug taking and what was perceived as a lack of effort, Richard Wright was fired from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> for the tour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a> but kept on solely as a paid session musician. However, due the amount of special effects necessary for the tour, it ended up being a financial loss for all the band... except for Richard Wright, who still received his wage for doing nothing.
</li><li> This trope is how Philadelphia sports update analyst Natalie Egenolf got her start in the media industry. As a teenage girl at the now defunct Cardinal Dougherty High School, her teachers decided that if she wasnt going to stop talking in the classroom, her chattiness was best utilized for their in House morning news program, CDTV. After her graduating, she enrolled at Temple University in Communications and the rest is history.
</li><li> At the start of Christian missions into Nordic countries, the missionaries very quickly learned that the idea of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">lake of fire</a> didn't sound like a particularly awful punishment for people who spent their entire lives in one of the coldest places on the planet. So if anything, by what these missionaries were saying, they should ignore the Bible <em>even more</em>. The missionaries wisely decided to stick with the version of Hel from Norse mythology as a place of insufferable cold and loneliness until they had spread Christianity enough to muscle out Norse mythology as a practiced religion.
