Or perhaps, her soon-to-be husband has difficulties, or maybe his mother has problems (often because she doesn't like any daughter-in-law taking the same name she changed her own to). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. This tropes usually starts with the woman in question writing out her maiden name along with her married time to try it out, or try saying it in front of a mirror for practice. Usually, the lady is an established career woman (or wants to be). Less often, there is the issue of the aesthetics of the name: should Rhea Mills have to be saddled with ridicule for the rest of her life for having married Robert Peer? (As a general rule, since you never know who she might marry, it would be wise to avoid naming your daughter "Anita".) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, obviously, and a potentially contentious issue.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A traditional solution was for a married woman to take her maiden name as a middle name (e.g.: Laura Ingalls Wilder). It's still done today, as was the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWright">Robin Wright</a> when she was married to Sean Penn (well... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">maybe that's not the most relevant case</a>). Note that this is different from the more modern solution of a hyphenated name. Robin Wright Penn is not the same as Robin Wright-Penn, and this can cause quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">annoyance</a> as hyphenated names gain more prominence over time, while the "maiden name as middle name" falls out of favor.
</p><p>Particularly applies if you're a media personality. This is partly due to working in an industry where your name is your brand, and partly due to the typical brevity of celebrity marriages.
</p><p>Not a completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTropes">Universal Trope</a>, as many cultures do not expect a woman to change her name (like Korea, Vietnam, China, Arab countries, and Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries), and some do not use surnames at all (like Iceland, Indonesia, and the Tamil people of South and Southeast Asia). Asians in general tend to avert this, with women keeping their names after marriage being the norm. This came from the belief that while a woman is expected to value her husband, she is supposed to value her parents <em>more</em>, so discarding the surname inherited from her father is considered disrespectful. The only exception is Japan, which prescribes husband and wife to be listed on the same family register, and thus to have the same surname. While it's almost always the woman who changes her registration and surname, it's legally equivalent for the man to do so and is considered a decent compromise if the woman is from a particularly high-status family (especially if they have a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyBusiness">Family Business</a>) and/or is the last of her name. This could similarly be required as part of marriage negotiations in England if the bride's family were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">nobility</a> but had no sons to carry on their name. The husband changing his last name in this manner would however require either an Act of Parliament or a Royal Warrant to enact, and thus was only even an option among the most well-connected families.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07emk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07emk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07emk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The same procedure was required if a noble with no surviving heirs bequeathed his estate to a distant cousin but required they adopt his last name to keep it alive. In such a case the adopted heir would keep his own father's last name but add the new name to it. Confusingly, hyphenation was traditionally not used for this and thus it'll look just like a middle name when written. In the modern era, some descendants of such families have added a hyphen to avoid that confusion, such as two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>'s cousins (though not the comedian himself).</span> Invariably the would involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">arranging a marriage</a> with a younger son of another noble family, who would thus still have their eldest son to carry on their own family name and keep both family dynasties intact. Women did not change their name in France before the Code Napoleon, which is why they still don't in Quebec. In the former Soviet Union, the choice to change one's name is part of the (civil and very bureaucratic) ceremony, and the man changing his name is not unheard-of, though less common than the woman changing her name or there being no name change at all.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Note that keeping the maiden name is extremely common among female scientists and other academics, as their professional reputation is built upon their peers being able to track their body of work through published studies, most of which only show the last name and first initial of the contributor. Female authors, likewise, and especially their publishers, tend to prefer it if their readers aren't confused by their books appearing with two different names on the covers. Women who do change their legal names when they marry may also continue to use their maiden names socially or professionally, especially in fields like acting where stage names are common.
</p><p>If a person with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a> marries a Two-Named person, regardless of gender, they will almost always take the Two-Named person's last name.
</p><p>Whether a married woman reverts to her maiden name after marriage usually depends on how it ends. If she's widowed, she'll usually keep the married name unless and until she remarries. If not, she's likely to go back to her maiden name unless her married name is socially or professionally advantageous.
</p><p>With same-sex marriage becoming legal in many parts of the world these days, the problem with applying this practice to a same-sex couple is obvious. Since there is no traditional protocol to follow, it's up to each couple to choose a solution that works for them. The most common solutions are for the spouses to simply keep their original names or to hyphenate. It's not unheard of for one partner to take the other's name, but it may lead to unwanted implications that the one who changes their name is the "passive" one in the relationship.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jouichiro Saiba took his wife's family name when he married, becoming Jouichiro Yukihira. The reasons have not yet been explored, but we know he loved his wife dearly, and there is enough of a whiff of scandal in his past that he may have seen it as a convenient way to change his name and drop off the radar.
<ul><li> As a corollary to the above, protagonist Soma Yukihira also inherited his mothers name, which (for good and ill) makes people not immediately realize who his father is.
</li></ul></li><li> Azami Nakamura became Azami Nakiri after marriage. In this case, his wife's family is extremely wealthy and powerful, and even if he wasn't the type who would want to brag about marrying a Nakiri (which he definitely is), the rest of the family would probably have had strong opinions about her changing her name and "leaving the family behind", so to speak.
</li></ul></li><li> Yui Ikari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> kept her maiden name when she married, which is highly unusual in Japan (generally only done if the woman comes from a prominent family whose name holds power). Her husband, Gendo Rokubungi, became Gendo Ikari when he took Yui's last name, though the reasons why aren't explicitly made clear. If the ambiguously canon information that Yui is the daughter of a SEELE member is to be believed, it may have been to gain a foothold in the organization. Within the show itself, though, it seems Gendo did it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">he really did love Yui</a>, and wanted to prove that he was utterly devoted to her. Note that even Fuyutsuki found his name change odd. It's possible he just wanted to lose the 'Rokubungi.' There's some implication that Gendo had a dark past he wanted to get away from, or a bad relationship with his own family.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> changes this: in this continuity, Gendo's name was always Ikari, and Yui's maiden name was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ayanami</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>: Fate Testarossa became Fate Testarossa-Harlaown (or T. Harlaown) after being adopted by Lindy Harlaown out of respect for her biological mother. She is later integrated into the "Takamachi Family" but just keeps her previous hyphenated last name. Both because it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">too obvious</a> and a tad wordy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note174b3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note174b3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note174b3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or invoke this trope over whether she would take the name Takamachi, Nanoha would take the name Testarossa-Harlaown, or both would go with the triple name</span>. In the second Megami Sound Stage, she apologizes for how long "Testarossa-Harlaown" is, noting that "both Testarossa and Harlaown are (her) real last names".
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever">Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever</a></em> continuity, Nanoha's father Shirou was originally a member of the Fuwa clan, but he changed his name to Takamachi when he married Momoko (presumably to throw his enemies off his track). It's ambiguous if this is the case in the <em>Nanoha</em> continuity.

Sadly, the Itoshiki family is very high-ranking, so she has trouble finding an acceptably prominent suitor. In fact, her brother's friend who is in love with all things old tries to marry her in order to acquire an old name (that is, the right to sign letters "Itoshiki [First Name], Old name Ikkyu," though the age of the Itoshiki name does make it more attractive).

Said man is very, <em>very</em> likely to become either a murder victim or a suspect.

Rukia and Renji's daughter Ichika was named "Ichika Abarai" when she was born, probably because were she named after the Kuchikis, this could potentially mean the accidental creation of a branch of the clan and would bring up a HUGE mess.</span>

Isshin is not only a former Captain of the Gotei 13, his family name was <em>Shiba</em>, one of the most powerful noble clans in Soul Society and an equal of the Kuchikis.

<ul><li> Pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisonInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisonInfiniteEarths">Crisis</a>, the Earth-Two Lois Lane changed her married name to "Lois Kent", but kept her maiden name for professional purposes like her post-Crisis counterpart. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, her name is a huge draw for readers of the Daily Planet, after all.

Strange, considering the fact that he was horribly abusive and that Moira's son Proteus was implied to be the result of marital rape. Partially justified seeing as her husband refused to divorce her, leading to her running away and pretending she was widowed... but when he actually died, there was no reason to keep using the name.
<ul><li> Although, academics and scientists have a tendency to retain the name under which they first published. Moira MacTaggert would also have achieved fame and peer recognition (e.g., her Nobel Prize) under the name MacTaggert, so she could not get entirely rid of it without causing confusion. At best, she could have called herself Kinross-MacTaggert.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntDimity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntDimity">Aunt Dimity</a></em> series, Lori retains her maiden name (Shepherd) after she marries, and is often found correcting people who call her "Mrs. Willis". That said, she is characteristically upbeat about the matter, and will ask people to call her "Lori".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">BattleTech Expanded Universe</a></em>, women who come from prominent families or are prominent in their own right either keep their own surname (e.g Melissa Steiner, Asai Rhys) or hyphenate their names (e.g Siriwen Mcallister-Kurita). The latter is more likely if their husband is also from a prominent family or prominent in his own right, though it is not universal as both Melissa and Asai married prominent men (Hanse Davion and Gerald Monroe respectively).

When they marry, women drop the paternal name and men the maternal one and replace it with the surname of their spouse.

Probably has Views. Do not attempt to kiss hand."
</li><li> In Lancre meanwhile, there's a sort of tradition of matrilinearity, at least amongst witches. So when Miss Gytha Ogg got married, she became Mrs Gytha Ogg and her husband became Mr. Ogg (as did her subsequent husbands — well, the ones that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">were actually hers</a>). Her married sons, however, are still Oggs, because none of her daughters-in-law are brave enough to explain to Nanny that they shouldn't be. (And the witches are not feminists. Their attitude to sexism is that it is fine to impose it on ordinary women, but that witches are, <em>of course</em> exempt from such rules.)

It doesn't keep the clueless from calling her "Lt. Roarke" (or worse, "Mrs. Roarke") and being quickly shut down. Roarke himself has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>, but does not adopt "Dallas" as a surname after marrying Eve.

Reijiro Enokizu laughingly points out the obvious—her maiden name came from her father, so if she really were that dedicated to having a name that only belongs to herself she should just come up with a completely new one.
</li><li> Comes up in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey">Lord Peter Wimsey</a></em> book <em>Thrones, Dominations</em> when Lord Peter's new wife, Harriet Vane (properly addressed as "Lady Peter" in the previous book, <em>Busman's Honeymoon</em>), informs her publisher that "You'd better just keep on calling me Miss Vane, it's so much easier" to the great consternation of Peter's aristocratic family. Lord Peter himself remarks that, when consulted, he agreed to the idea with alacrity, as "It gives one the illusion of having both a wife and a mistress, which is obviously gratifying."
</li><li> <em>A Love for All Time</em> by Bertrice Small begins in Elizabethan England. Queen Elizabeth commands one of her courtiers, Conn O'Malley, who is a troublesome Irishman, to marry Aidan St. Michael, who is a titled Englishwoman, and to take her name along with the title that went with it. He agreed, mainly because of the title. One of the queen's advisors pointed out that this would effectively make Conn an Englishman.
</li><li> In E.F. Benson's <em>Mapp and Lucia</em> novels, the recurring character Olga Braceley has kept her maiden name. Upon first meeting Olga's husband, Lucia commits a faux pas by mistakenly addressing him as Mr Braceley (his actual surname is Shuttleworth). The general thrust of the incident is that Olga to a large extent represents a more glamorous and more bohemian world to which Lucia aspires, but about which she is so naive that it would never even occur to her that a wife might not take her husband's name.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCoville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCoville">Bruce Coville</a> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterOfTheYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterOfTheYear">Monster of the Year</a></em> has Michael McGraw, whose mother (Elsa Adams) changed her name to her husband's when she got married, changed back after they divorced, and said she'd stay with her maiden name for the rest of her life. Michael, on the other hand, had his name changed to match his stepfather's. As he puts it, "This confuses outsiders, since they can't figure out who I really belong to, but it suits the three of us just fine."
</li><li> <em>Sebastian Barth</em> (a series by James Howe): Sebastian's mother Katie Hallem kept her maiden name when she married Will Barth.

This causes a minor issue for interracial couple Dag Redwing and Fawn Bluefield. While they briefly consider splicing their surnames (Redfield, Bluewing) or merging them (Purple-something), Dag eventually takes Fawn's surname.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, Queen Cersei keeps her maiden name Lannister despite marrying King Robert Baratheon, and gives her children a double-barreled last name of "Baratheon and Lannister." Westeros tradition established by the Targaryens prevents the consort of the King (or any Targaryen prince, for that matter) from taking his name, in part because the Targaryens were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">very weird</a> about blood purity and didn't want "outsiders" being brought into the Targaryen line. For every other position, such as Lord of one of the Seven Kingdoms, the wife takes her husband's name.
<ul><li> Exceptions are made for women who either hold or are the heir to a title. In that case, both husband and wife keep their names and their children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom">take their mother's name</a> to ensure its continuation. If both spouses are heirs or title-holders, they split the inheritance between their children, where the heir to the man's title keeps his/her dad's name, and the heir to the woman's title takes his/her mother's name.
<ul><li> Even those who inherit a different family's title through a female ancestor are expected to take that family's name for themselves. For instance, the current heir to the Vale, Harrold Hardying, is the grandson of the sister of Jon Arryn, and he is expected to change his name to Harrold Arryn when he inherits.
</li></ul></li><li> Going back to the setting's history, when one Lannister king died without male heirs, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirInLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirInLaw">son-in-law</a> changed his name from Joffrey Lydden to Joffrey Lannister as a condition of being given the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> Susan Silverman of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser">Spenser</a></em> novels uses her ex-husband's surname. Brad Silverman, however, changed his name after the divorce to the less Jewish-sounding "Sterling".
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em> books, where a woman taking her husband's last name is considered an archaic holdover from a primitive past, like the "perverted" concept of monogamy. Lieutenant Shea Ashton (née Ryan) constantly has to correct people to call her by her new name.
</li><li> This is the twist ending of the classic Soviet SF novel <em>Star KETs</em> by Aleksandr Belyaev. A mysterious stranger asks the protagonist about his girlfriend. He says he knows her former co-worker Paley, who disappeared with important research data. But he has no time to explain, gives his forwarding address and leaves. The protagonists chase the stranger all over USSR and end up spending eight months working on the eponymous space station waiting for his return from an expedition to the asteroid belt. Nobody they ask knows of Paley. In the end the stranger turns out to be Paley, who took his wife's name. The idea was still novel for mid-1930s. And the data was waiting for them in Leningrad right from the start.

Later flashbacks imply (but never outright state) that the name came from Grams's first husband and true love, whose death caused her to become the warlock-hunting superwitch she was known as. Leo points out that the name Halliwell is highly respected in the magical community.

It mostly comes from a combination of strict protocols regarding how servants are addressed and the characters habit of marrying their coworkers:
<ul><li> Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Patmore are entitled to use Mrs in combination with their maiden names by virtue of their positions as housekeeper and cook, respectable positions that a woman would historically have to forgo marriage to achieve.
</li><li> Anna would normally be called Bates upon her promotion from head housemaid to ladys maid, but keeps going by Anna because her husband is a valet, the male equivalent, and therefore already Bates.
</li><li> Theres a lot of joking and a bit of dread both upstairs and downstairs at the prospect of Mrs. Hughes becoming Mrs. Carson, to the point that Robert proposes a toast when he learns that she plans to keep using her maiden name professionally.
</li><li> Finally, Lady Mary Crawley takes her husband Matthew Crawleys last name, but because theyre (distant) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Kissing Cousins</a> nobody really notices.

<ul><li> Germany has changed laws multiple times in attempts to figure out the issue. Currently parents have to settle on one "family name" for all their children (which can be either the name of the mother or the father, but not a combination of both to avoid overly long family names), while the parents themselves might (depending on the current ruling at the time of marriage) either stick both to their names, or one of them having to use a combination. In general, the husband taking the family name of the wife has become more common.
</li><li> This is an issue for same-sex couples since obviously there either isn't a wife or there isn't a husband in the picture. Therefore, there's no tradition to go by. Some take just one of their names. Some hyphenate. Some even pick out an entirely new name for themselves. Lately, there's also been a discussion brewing about how male couples who change one or both of their names are supposed to refer to their old name(s) since "maiden name" obviously doesn't work.
<ul><li> Official documents in Poland usually circumvent this by using the term <em>nazwisko rodowe</em> (translated as "family name") for the surname one is born with, as opposed to <em>nazwisko</em> ("surname") meaning the bearer's current name.
</li><li> Dan Savage wrote an interesting piece about trying to figure out what last name to give their son when he and his husband (then boyfriend) adopted him. They compromised by giving him his birthmother's last name, which seemed like a sweet gesture at the time, but wound up leading to a lot of trouble later on - it was hard enough to convince workers at airports and national borders that they weren't two strangers kidnapping a baby even <em>without</em> having to explain why the baby didn't share either of their last names.
</li></ul></li><li> It's not entirely unheard of for a newly married couple create a new last name,<a class="urllink" href="http://www.babyzone.com/baby-names/baby-name-articles/last-word-on-last-names_71348-page-3">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><a class="urllink" href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_whose-last-name-should-you-give-your-baby_10327041.bc?page=3">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> whether it is original symbolizing the new life as a married couple<a class="urllink" href="http://www.fromtwotoone.com/2011/07/our-new-name.html">[3]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><a class="urllink" href="http://thefeministmystique.blogspot.com/2012/04/m-last-name-project.html">[4]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName">portmanteau</a> of the spouses' original family names.<a class="urllink" href="http://thefeministmystique.blogspot.com/2012/04/sue-last-name-project.html">[5]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Many actresses (at least American ones) actually will legally change their names when they get married, but continue to use their <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreenActorsGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreenActorsGuild">Screen Actors Guild</a>-registered unmarried names professionally. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>, for instance, changed her name to Alyson Denisof upon marrying Alexis Denisof, but still uses "Hannigan" as her screen name.
</li><li> Some cultures avoid this:
<ul><li> In Korea, for instance, the wife never changes her surname (the children retain their father's surname or mother's surname if couple agreed on it when they did the legal marriage paperwork).
</li><li> Something similar happens in Spanish naming customs. Maiden names don't exist and children have two surnames, usually the first surname from the father and the second surname from the mother. The order can be legally swapped if the person wishes.
<ul><li> Also, anyone may choose to go by whichever of their surnames they choose, even if they don't change it legally. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note91ptu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note91ptu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note91ptu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course it's only social, in legal documents, they have to use their father's name.</span> Case in point: José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the former Prime Minister of Spain, had a strained relationship with his father and chose to go by his maternal surname Zapatero rather than the more typical Rodríguez. Or Pablo Ruíz Picasso that is known for his mother's surname.
</li><li> It used to be traditional in Hispanic cultures for the wife to take their husband's name with the preposition "de" meaning "of". Thus when María García married Juan Pérez she'd be known as "María <strong>de</strong> Pérez (María of Pérez). The custom has fallen out of practice due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">rather unfortunate implication</a> that the wife is her husband's property. However, a form of the custom does live on: while no woman would call herself "María de Pérez" but always "María García" if trying to be short, a full introduction (e.g. in an official context) might have her introduce herself as "María García de Pérez". A prime example is the President of Argentina, Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner, who typically goes by "Cristina Fernández" (although she'll often add the "de Kirchner" part to invoke the memory of her late husband, her predecessor Néstor Kirchner).
</li><li> Actually, Spanish people have oficially two last names, one from the father and the other from the mother, but extra-oficially they also inherit the last names of the maternal grandfather and both grandmothers, to the point when they can recite six or eight last names. This is the fact that led to the stereotype that Hispanic people have really long names.
</li></ul></li><li> In Quebec, it is actually illegal for one spouse to take another's name.
</li><li> In Japan, it's not unheard of for the husband to take the wife's name if she's the last of the family line to bear the name (and it helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">if her family is well-off</a>).
<ul><li> A notable example of this would be <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiroemon_Kimura">Jiroemon Kimura<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, primarily known for being the only male verified to have reached 116 years of age. He was born Kinjiro Miyake, and changed his name on marriage, since his wife's family did not have a male heir.
</li><li> Technically, because of the <em>koseki</em> (family register) system, the idea is that the couple must be listed as members of the same family. A man taking on his wife's name is actually taking on the family name of <em>her father</em>, since a woman will always be on the <em>koseki</em> of either her father's family or her husband's family.
</li></ul></li><li> There's an interesting variation in traditional Chinese naming. A woman who marries would keep her own surname, and their children would take the father's name. However, they could be referred to in various manners, like Mrs. <em>husband's surname</em>, or <em>husband's personal name</em> plus <em>appropriate address form for stranger</em>, or <em>husband's surname</em> plus <em>her own surname</em> plus the word 氏 <em>shi</em>, which is akin to saying née in English. Today Chinese women may follow Anglo-Western naming customs, but as an example, a woman whose name is Chen Jiao (陳嬌) who marries a Shi Dachuan (石大川) could be referred to as the following:
<ul><li> 陳嬌 <em>Chen Jiao</em> (the woman's own name);
</li><li> 石夫人 <em>Shi Furen</em> (archaic, "Madame Shi");
</li><li> 石太太 <em>Shi Taitai</em> (modern, "Mrs. Shi");
</li><li> 川嫂/嬸/姨/姑/婆 <em>Chuan Sao/Shen/Yi/Gu/Po</em> ("Aunty Chuan," rather than "Aunty Jiao");
</li><li> or 石陳氏 <em>Shi Chen shi</em> ("Mrs. Shi née Chen", although it's archaic and mainly restricted to historical fiction)
</li></ul></li><li> In Ancient Rome women kept their family names, but by the late Republic era most women didn't have given names as once they married they would be the only person in the household with their family names and could simply be referred to as thus.
<ul><li> To elaborate. Every daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar was named simply "Julia Caesaris", the feminine of the family name. Roman noblewomen married very young, at approximately 13, so this did not normally become a problem, as she would be the "Julia" of her husband's family.
</li></ul></li><li> In Italy both partners keep their original last names but can choose to add their partner's at the end. They lose it in case of divorce, but can continue using it if widowed until they remarry. It is however customary to refer to a married woman by her husband's name.
<ul><li> Children can take both of their parents' names, without hyphens. This is usually not done, but older families can do it, especially if the father married in a noble one.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10n2tn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10n2tn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10n2tn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As example could be the current head of the Colonna di Sciarra family, whose name is Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra: "Riario Sforza" being his father's last name who married in the Colonna di Sciarras, and "Barberini Colonna di Sciarra" his mother's</span> This is according to <em>post-Italian unification laws</em>, as before unification the rules depended on the country<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11t4n2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11t4n2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11t4n2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Using the previous example, the Riario Sforza are a branch of the <em>Riario</em> family and named according to ancient Genoese rules when, in 1477, Girolamo Riario married Caterina Sforza, the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Milan, while the "Barberini" bit comes from Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra marrying the daughter of Urbano Barberini and giving his son his mother's last name to let him keep the rights to his grandfather's fiefs according to the 18th century rules of the Papal States. As for the "di Sciarra", that came when the Colonna di Sciarra branched out of the Colonna family and named themselves after <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciarra_Colonna">their founders' (in)famous brother<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</span>
</li><li> Foreigners marrying in Italy keep their own names, but can have it changed in their own country and then update their Italian IDs.
</li></ul></li><li> In France both partners keep their birth name forever, with the woman being customarily called Mrs. and with her husband's name unless she specifies. This is the law, but most people assume that the woman always takes her husband's name and act as if she legally changed it.
</li><li> In Greece, the wife keeps her original surname, while the children take the surname of their father. In past decades, the wives of prolific families would use both their surname and that of their husband in tandem, but this has since been dropped.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CherylCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CherylCole">Cheryl Cole</a> of pop group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsAloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsAloud">Girls Aloud</a> and judge on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a></em> was originally Cheryl Tweedy. When she married Ashley Cole in 2006, she changed her name to Cole for personal and professional use. She kept the name after their divorce in 2009 as she became more known as Cole. After she remarried, she adopted Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, but bills her music as just Cheryl because it was easier for the designers of her album covers. When her second marriage ended, she has simply refers to herself as just Cheryl.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Rodham</a> married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, she had already established herself as a successful lawyer and writer. Up until her first tenure as first lady of Arkansas she kept that name, but when Bill lost the governorship in 1980 his advisors claimed her decision was one of the main reasons he lost (forget the thousands of Cuban refugees he permitted to enter the state and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Reagan's coattails</a>), presumably because voters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> perceived a woman to using her maiden name as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a>. She compromised, changing her name to Hillary Rodham Clinton for publishing and law-practicing purposes. Since her 2016 presidential campaign she's been known officially as Hillary Clinton.
</li><li> Annie Mae "Tina" Turner kept her married name after divorcing Ike, enduring the bad memories attached to it, for business purposes. It worked, however, as she brought far more good to that name than Ike ever did.
</li><li> There was (and still is, in many places) a significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> about this. For women to change their names after marriage was a simple procedure, while for the man to take his wife's name required moving hell and earth. The most famous person to do this is probably the NFL's London Fletcher-Baker, who adopted the Baker to honor his father-in-law.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> is actually named Joanne <em>Murray</em> since marrying in late 2001. She just didn't bother to change her pen name (which technically was a pseudonym anyway, since she never had a middle name). All three of her children have "Rowling" as a middle name, however.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> was Agatha Mallowan from 1930, but she kept Christie (her first husband's surname) as her pen name.
</li><li> An interesting case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">Jon Stewart</a>. His birth name was Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz, and he chose Jon Stewart as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageNames">professional name</a> (mostly because he'd had some really nasty fights with his father). About a year after he married Tracy McShane, they <em>both</em> changed their legal last names to Stewart. Note that even before he got married, Stewart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotCallMePaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotCallMePaul">refused to respond to anyone who called him by his birth name</a> except when it was unavoidable (e.g. on official ID documents).
</li><li> Meg and Jack White (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes">The White Stripes</a>) invert this: John Anthony "Jack" <em>Gillis</em> married Megan Martha White in 1996 and they divorced in 2000. He took, and kept, her last name of White and they remained on good enough terms to keep going in the band together.
</li><li> Cherie Blair, wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a>, uses Cherie Booth (she's the daughter of actor Anthony Booth) for her legal work. A confusing situation in that she had already been a barrister for four years when she married Tony Blair, and for the fact that she accepts being called "Cherie Blair" or even "Mrs. Tony Blair" outside of being a barrister.
</li><li> When Geraldine Ferraro, who didn't change her name, was the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee, no one quite knew what to call her on the campaign trail. Senator Barry Goldwater insisted on referring to her as "Mrs. Zacarro." George HW Bush referred to her as "Mrs. Ferraro" in their vice presidential debate. This was before "Ms" really caught on as the marriage neutral honorific for professional women. Fast forward 30 some years and high ranking female politicians like Speaker Nancy Pelosi (the highest ranking woman ever in the American governments history) are usually referred to as "Ms." even if they changed their names upon marriage (as she did). Women who didnt change their names also are referred to as Ms. In the former case, it just comes down to editorial standards. For example, <em> The Wall Street Journal </em> and <em> The Washington Post </em> use Ms. as a blanket term for while <em>The New York Times </em> asks if they want to be referred to as Mrs. or Ms. and uses what they prefer.
</li><li> While, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did take her husband Martins surname when they got married in 1954, she abhors being called Mrs Ginsburg. Shes always used Ms Bader Ginsburg instead, both personally and professionally. She did, however, know to pick her battles about it when she was younger.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno">Yoko Ono</a>, she became Yoko Ono Lennon. And he became John Ono Lennon, legally changing his middle name from Winston to Ono.
</li><li> A contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinBenSteinsMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinBenSteinsMoney">Win Ben Stein's Money</a></em> told the story of his marriage to a woman surnamed "Wolfe". His own surname was "Dark", so they decided to both change to the hyphenate "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Dark-Wolfe</a>."
</li><li> A somewhat notorious case of that occurred in Russia around 1830. Colonel Zass, having no sons, would allow major Rantsev to marry his daughter only if the newlyweds take the name Zass-Rantsev. And he would not accept Rantsev-Zass, since Zass family was much more noble. Nothing unusual for those days, except that "Zass-Rantsev" sounds like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">shitter</a>" in Russian. The groom had to petition the tsar to change the name to Rantsev-Zass. Fortunately, Nikolai I didn't like "discordant" names and encouraged his subjects to change them.
</li><li> Polar explorer Apsley George Benet Cherry-Garrard was born Apsley Cherry, but the terms of his great-aunt's will required his family to take her name in order to inherit her estate.
</li><li> Pulitzer Prize-winner Connie Schultz wrote a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cleveland.com/schultz/index.ssf/2011/06/beware_marital_identity_theft.html">column<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a reader who consistently criticizes her for not taking her husband's surname and insists on using it in lieu of her chosen maiden name.
</li><li> For some reason, the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChancellorsOfGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChancellorsOfGermany">Chancellor of Germany</a>, Angela Merkel still uses the name of her first husband, even though they divorced back in 1982, and she's currently married to Joachim Sauer. (Her birth name is Angela Kasner.)
<ul><li> While Merkel had already been divorced for 8 years by the time of her first election, she was a chemist involved in scientific research before that. And while she'd been dating her current husband long before entering politics, it took them well over a decade to marry... by which point she was one of the most prominent politicians in Germany and thus would've potentially caused confusion on the ballots by changing her name again.
</li><li> Opera singer Angela Giorgheu has a similar pattern (she became famous using the name of her first husband, and carried on using it even after she'd divorced and remarried. Possibly because her birthname sounded rather unglamerous- for that matter it wasn't 'Angela' either.)
</li><li> A similar example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> singer Grace Slick (born Grace Barnett Wing), who married Jerry Slick in the early 1960s and kept her married name after their divorce and her later remarriage to Skip Johnson.
</li><li> Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren (née Herring) also kept her first husband Jim's name after divorce. She had already built up her law practice under that name by the time they got divorced. She's been married to her second husband Bruce Mann since 1980.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by BBC Radio 2 newsreader Fenella Haddingham, who has <em>exactly</em> the accent you'd expect a woman with a name like that to have, when she became known as Fenella <em>Fudge</em> after getting married. Listeners are still wondering why.
</li><li> Another inversion: Paul Landers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> was born Heiko Paul Hiersche (he later dropped his first name), but when he married Nikki Landers, he took her surname and still kept it after they divorced.
</li><li> Kim Deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> this trope for her first two albums with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies">The Pixies</a>, crediting herself as "Mrs. John Murphy" to mock a woman she'd met who insisted that she wanted to be known by her husband's name.
</li><li> Roosevelt administration Labor Secretary Frances Perkins (1933-45), who was the first woman ever appointed to a Cabinet position in America, kept her last name and even won the right to do so in court. At 33, she got married late for the era and had already built a name for herself working in New York State politics. She didnt want to confuse anyone. She also wanted to keep her work separate from her husbands, who also worked in state level politics. Her husband was also mentally ill, making her the family breadwinner in a time in which both were very stigmatized so keeping her name gave her a level of separation from the situation.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>, who married fellow actor Brian Miller in 1968, kept her maiden name for her professional career, she was "Lis Miller" at home.
</li><li> Olympic beach volleyball legends Misty May and Kerri Walsh both got married between Beijing 2008 and London 2012, and are now credited as Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, illustrating two of the options mentioned above.
</li><li> Carrie Underwood married then Ottawa Senator Mike Fisher in 2009, perhaps to not be mistaken for actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher">Carrie Fisher</a>.
</li><li> Japanese writer Fuyumi Ohno, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em>, kept her maiden name as her pen-name after marrying.
</li><li> Since her marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidMitchellActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidMitchellActor">David Mitchell</a> in 2012, Victoria Coren has used all three variations of her name <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12u36v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12u36v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12u36v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Victoria Coren, Victoria Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell</span>, in both personal and professional capacities, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/15/women">as chronicled in her The Observer column.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>, née Tomalin, has always used the surname of first husband Chris Sarandon in her professional life, during and after her common law marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimRobbins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimRobbins">Tim Robbins</a>.
</li><li> Science fiction/horror writers Steve Rasnic Tem and Melanie Tem chose a new surname on marriage. He still uses his "maiden" name as a middle name because he had published under it when he was single.
</li><li> Actor/singer Carlos Pena, Jr. and actress/singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexaVega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexaVega">Alexa Vega</a> took a combined surname of PenaVega upon marriage.
</li><li> When Antonio Villar, Jr. married Corina Raigosa in 1987, they combined their surnames into a new name, Villaraigosa. They eventually divorced two decades later, but Antonio, who'd gained huge name recognition as the mayor of Los Angeles, elected to keep the combined name.
</li><li> Norman Geddes married Helen Belle Schneider in 1917, and they coined a new surname for the union: Bel Geddes. Norman became a celebrated theatrical and industrial designer, and the Bel Geddes name gained further prominence when their daughter Barbara became a famous actress. Barbara was married twice but kept her distinctive maiden name.
</li><li> When <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TradingSpaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TradingSpaces">Trading Spaces</a></em> host Paige Davis married her husband, Broadway actor Patrick Page, she kept her maiden name for understandable reasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeraMiles">Vera Miles</a> kept the surname of her first husband, Bob Miles, after they divorced. She couldn't go back to her maiden name, Vera Ralston, because there was already a well-known actress by that name (a former champion figure skater who moved to Hollywood). To make things even more confusing, both Veras co-starred in films with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>.
