Crimes that are often committed in the pursuit of the proof of innocence include resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, grand theft auto, breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, assault and fraud. The immunity to consequences for those acts is a specific form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance">Hero Insurance</a>, perhaps granted because they are perceived as acting under compulsion, like a twisted version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a>. In many cases, the transgressions they commit are also comparatively minor (property damage against the bad guy, petty or returnable in same condition theft, perhaps an assault that doesn't result in lasting injury) when compared to the crime they have been wrongly accused of, thus allowing the audience to overlook them and maintain sympathy with the character; when the crime <em>isn't</em>, however, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">good luck keeping them on the hero's side</a>.

Alternately, the government may be sufficiently damaged over the course of the story that it no longer has the capability to prosecute the hero.

However, since all of his actions are justified, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">name is cleared</a> due to having a good attorney, a criminal psychologist, and a cop's thorough testimony on his side, the trope is averted.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>. What's the first thing Gene does upon his return to Sentinel? Jail time.

Even if intergalactic pirates are to blame, that just knocks it down from a criminal charge to an exorbitantly high fine. Fred paid that though, so it's alright (or, considering how much Gene already owes Fred, maybe not).

<ul><li> In Patrice Dard's L'Histoire de France de Marie-Marie, Producer Darryl E. Nuck really has Wrongful Accusation Insurance... more precisely, he is "insured against miscarriages of justice". In fact, he appears to be insured against EVERYTHING that could possibly go wrong.

After Fudge announces Sirius' innocence in public, he attempts to bring up the matter of Sirius escaping Azkaban... until a journalist reminds him he announced Sirius would be free of <strong>all</strong> charges up to date. Commonly played straight in every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic that uses this plot, actually. Probably justified by the fact that he was locked up in <em>very</em> irregular circumstances, to the point where any criminal investigation would be focused on the people who locked him up in the first place. In other fics, he's officially declared guilty of the relatively smaller crimes but, since the time he previously spent in Azkaban is more than the combined sentence one can get for them, he officially already served it. And in an even smaller group, he's asked to perform community service for a time until the government feels he's paid his debt to society.

However, since he jumped off the train while driving it, it might have been counted as "borrowing it without permission" because he only used it that one time.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Films — Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMurderOfCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMurderOfCrows">A Murder of Crows</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lawson Russell murders Corvus in cold blood after he discovers Corvus was the killer and had framed him for previous murders. The film ends with Russell being cleared of all murder charges, including the murder of Corvus, even though he did commit that one.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterpreter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterpreter">The Interpreter</a></em> has the main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">break into a UN panic room and try to murder a head of state with a gun (though she desisted at the last minute)</span>. The last scene in the film shows her casually sitting in the UN garden and having a friendly chat with Sean Penn's DS character about leaving the country, with no indication that anything she did would ever have repercussions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNegotiator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNegotiator">The Negotiator</a></em> is built around this trope. Samuel Jackson's character takes over an office building and holds people hostage, but it's all right as long as he catches the bad guy in the end.
</li><li> The protagonist of the French film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellNoOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellNoOne">Tell No One</a></em> caused a massive pile-up on one of Paris's busiest roads, one that certainly caused a lot of property damage, if no actual injuries.
</li><li> Jamie Foxx's character at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Collateral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Collateral">Collateral</a></em> is forced to impersonate an assassin and ends up committing a few crimes over the course of the end of the movie trying to save the last victim of said assassin. Good thing the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> last victim on the list was a prosecutor because when this is over, he's going to need all the legal help he can get</span>.
</li><li> The protagonist and girlfriend in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>' monster mash <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheEyeCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheEyeCreatures">Attack of the Eye Creatures</a></em> were framed for a murder committed by the "creatures". Our heroes break out of jail and steal a police car. The girlfriend's influential father "takes care of everything" by having these charges dismissed.
</li><li> In the early '90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheSeries">film remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>, Dr. Kimble commits multiple burglaries (a clinic, a hospital, an apartment), thefts, auto theft (ambulance to be specific), unauthorized use of medical records, accessory after the fact in the murder of a transit cop (disposing of the gun, even though he didn't shoot the officer), and more in the course of proving that he didn't murder his wife. This is to say nothing of his original escape from custody, which is illegal whether or not you are innocent of the crime you are accused or convicted of (running away to avoid being hit by debris from a derailing train is justified, but continuing to run instead of turning himself in...). Notably, however, the film ends with him in the custody of the US Marshals who were pursuing him throughout the movie, and while he's cleared himself of the original murder, there's no indication that all the other stuff is just going to be let slide. This said, the rather shady circumstances around his original arrest and conviction (including a fairly hefty, albeit never directly confirmed, whiff of corruption on part of the authorities) heavily suggest that he's unlikely to face too hefty a punishment; the point is simply that he's not simply let go after everything.
</li><li> An even more glaring example of this is seen in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/USMarshals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/USMarshals">U.S. Marshals</a></em>, in which Mark Sheridan commits numerous felonies in the course of proving his innocence and attempting to flee the country-kidnapping, assault, and assault with a deadly weapon on a federal agent (when he shoots Gerard but deliberately aims for his bulletproof vest). His girlfriend counts as well, for aiding and abetting him. What's more, she might not yet be a US citizen and might even be in the country illegally, so her actions are enough to warrant her being deported. But at the end of the film, they're all seen walking out of a courthouse with a few throwaway lines about him being "cleared of all charges." However, it probably doesn't hurt his case that one of the people assigned to guard him, and later pursue him, was actually attempting to murder him to cover up his own crimes, making surrender something of a non-option. Given that Richard Kimble's crimes were so minor in comparison, one can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> that he received the same treatment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleJeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleJeopardy">Double Jeopardy</a></em> has a variant where the protagonist is being chased for violating parole, having already been released for murdering her husband. She goes free after exposing her husband for faking his death earlier, in spite of breaking and entering, stealing Lehman's car, stealing his gun, assaulting him, transporting said gun across state lines without a permit, property damage, and let's not forget her unremitting plan to <em>murder a man</em>, thanks to this film's use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport">Minority Report</a></em> has John Anderton committing theft, assault, and resisting arrest while trying to prove he won't murder someone. In the movie, he admittedly goes out of his way to not harm the PreCrime cops sent to get him. In the Game of the Movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation">you're free to slaughter them by the hundreds while trying to prove you wouldn't commit</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation">one murder</a></em>. In the original short story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anderton kills the guy anyway, and, due to the circumstances, gets off with a relative slap on the wrist in the form of exile to another planet.</span>
</li><li> About 1/4 of the way through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAMadMadMadMadWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAMadMadMadMadWorld">It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a></em>, the police note that even though none of the treasure hunters have a criminal record, they now have resisted arrest, destroyed property, burglarized a hardware store, assaulted many people, etc. This is all met basically with a shrug (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> in that the cops are waiting for these people to lead them to the stolen money.) The main reason any of their charges would be dismissed: the judge is about to throw the book at Captain Culpeper, who has lost his pension, his wife is divorcing him, his mother-in-law is suing him for damages, and his daughter is filing to have her name changed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceAcademy">Police Academy</a></em>, Cadet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Leslie Barbara</a> encounters some old acquaintances and thinks they're stealing furniture from a building.

Presumably, that gets included in the full pardon they get at the end from President Bush. Although the deaths were due to the agents' incompetence rather than caused by H&amp;K directly, it would be their word against the government since there were no surviving witnesses, and anyway it'd still count as felony murder.

Some probably couldn't be proven, and others the police might not pursue (such as those against Russian gangsters).

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>; at one point, Castle is framed for murder by an old enemy who informs him that he's arranged for Castle to be murdered as soon as he arrives at Central Processing. Castle proceeds to arrange for his escape from custody, at which point he and Beckett work together to prove that he was framed. Once the proof is discovered, Captain Gates points out that Castle will still need to surrender himself to the District Attorney and will face charges for escaping police custody, but notes that the unusual circumstances mean that he'll most likely only receive a slap-on-the-wrist fine and the time he's already served as punishment.
</li><li> Subverted in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a></em>. When Hutch is wrongly charged with murdering his ex-wife, Starsky is ordered to bring Hutch in. However, in the middle of arresting him, Starsky instead handcuffs the accompanying officer to a table and effectively kidnaps Hutch to track down the real killer, probably exposing <em>himself</em> to more serious obstruction charges than Hutch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Luther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Luther">Luther</a></em> the main character escapes without punishment after it's revealed he was being framed, even though in the process of proving himself innocent he definitely did hold two officers at gunpoint, smash up a police car, and steal evidence. Given how embarrassing the whole affair was it seems likely that it was swept under the rug as best they could. Ironically his partner was punished more severely (demoted back to uniform) for obstructing the investigation despite his interference saving Luther's life because while Luther naturally knew that he was innocent, his partner simply refused to believe he was guilty regardless of the evidence.
</li><li> Happens over and over again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0">Hawaii Five-0</a>,</em> starting with the time Steve gets accused of murdering Governor Jameson in the first season finale. It's getting to the point where the cops should probably just assume that if a Five-0 officer is a suspect in a crime, they're being somehow framed or coerced because otherwise HPD will end up spending yet more taxpayer money on ridiculous car chases. Five-0 now has such a reputation for pulling out all the stops to fight wrongful accusations that a convicted murderer actually breaks out of federal custody just to get them to prove his innocence.

He (depending on the player's actions) may wind up evading arrest and assaulting police officers and damaging property and driving recklessly and, though not directly related to the evasion, deliberately kills a largely innocent man (although the police probably doesn't know he did it). If he doesn't get caught, once the police stop chasing him he's off scot-free. The fact that Lt.

In the cases where your client is innocent of the murder they're accused of, but guilty of other crimes (e.g <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lana Skye</span> from the first game), they typically still end up serving time for those, leaving the case with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>.

<ul><li> While there isn't anywhere on Earth that plays this <em>completely</em> straight, there are some places where the law expressly forbids punishing someone for exercising their natural "desire for freedom". Sure, they'll still do their damnedest to get you back, as well as try you for any crimes committed during your escape, but not for the act itself (e.g. escaping from jail without breaking any laws vs. escaping from jail by murdering your guards). However, on the other side of the coin, some places punish escape attempts by doubling your sentence <em>and then holding you to it even if you are later exonerated of the crime for which you were imprisoned in the first place</em>. In some jurisdictions where escaping from prison isn't itself illegal, you might be still be charged with theft of government property if you fail to return your prison uniform.
</li><li> Also, juries of your peers can make it less likely for anyone in this situation to be <em>convicted</em> (people are generally not inclined to throw innocent people back in jail for the crime of trying to escape an unjust punishment, particularly as, in several of the fictional examples, they were accused under fraudulent or false pretenses in the first place), though it won't stop them getting charged.
</li><li> The trope may be played straight sometimes with two conditions: when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s unlawful actions are comparatively minor and when the evidence he or she leaves behind is too flimsy for the authorities to build a case against him or her. However, too many people tend to take the trope at face value and seek their justice in a manner a bit <em>too</em> rough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">to get free out of jail</a>.
</li><li> Defense Attorneys are a non-violent and non-criminal variation of this trope. Lawyers can collect evidence to prove a person's innocence without the defendant having to do it themselves while on the run from the law. Many examples of this trope would be considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plot</a> if the accused doesn't contact their lawyer.
</li><li> Played straight with a little known and less used concept in American law called "Jury Nullification" where a jury may decide that either the circumstances surrounding the crime require the jury to ignore the law or in cases where the government's actions are so egregious that a jury simply refuses to convict. Related to this is the much more rare "outrageous government conduct" defense, in which the defendant seeks outright dismissal of charges because the actions of the police and/or prosecutors are so far beyond acceptable that it denies fundamental fairness. The requirements for this defense are so high that only three successful uses of it were documented in an 18-month period.
