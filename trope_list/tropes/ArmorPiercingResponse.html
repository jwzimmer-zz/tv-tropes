He fights Goku and claims that there is no good in him, that he is a cold-hearted warrior who only cares about himself and then he blurts out that his family means nothing to him. Goku (who is usually a pretty funny guy, even in Super Saiyan) angrily calls him a liar and then punches him so hard he drops to the ground. Vegeta survives it, but the words have a huge impact, because he never tries to be a bad guy again and from then on firmly joins the good guys.

<div class="indent"><strong>Fukaboshi</strong>: What have you experienced in your past?! Just what have humans done to you?!

Yuu tells Touko that none of Touko's friends know Mio, and if they like Touko, those feelings are directed at her, not her sister. Touko isn't fully convinced, but after the following exchange, what Yuu's trying to tell her finally starts to sink in.
<div class="indent"><strong>Touko</strong>: What everyone thinks is me is really just me acting like my sister... <br/><strong>Yuu</strong>: But you are the one who's worked so hard to be like her, senpai!

Maki, however, bluntly tells her that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar">Not So Similar</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Maki</strong>: You're just running away. Haven't you realized? You're just afraid. You already know how it feels to fall in love. You're just trying not to acknowledge it because having your love reciprocated hurts.

She's shocked to learn that Mitsuki, her coworker at the salon who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DislikesTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DislikesTheNewGuy">always disliked her</a>, is none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">her former friend from elementary school</a>, who told everyone about her façade and ruined Hime's reputation. When Hime tells this to her friend Kanoko, Kanoko gives the following reply.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Kanoko</strong>: Well then, you don't have to worry about her liking you. She already knows about your facade, so you don't have to keep up the act to try to get her to like you, do you?
</div><ul><li> Later on, Mitsuki confronts Hime over why their friendship fell apart. The two had planned on playing in a piano recital together, but Hime, realizing that their classmates were spreading rumors about Mitsuki bullying Hime into taking part, quits the recital to try to prevent Mitsuki from being seen as a bully. Unfortunately, she never told Mitsuki, who, unable to believe anything Hime said because of her lying all the time, exposed her as a liar. Mitsuki remains bitter about what she perceives as Hime's betrayal for years, until she confronts Hime about it.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Mitsuki</strong>: You just quit... because you wanted to, right...? <br/><strong>Hime</strong>: I did it for you!
</div><ul><li> In Volume 3, Kanoko, who's Hime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> and has an unrequited crush on Hime, becomes jealous of Hime's closeness with her former friend Mitsuki, even after Sumika tells her that the bonds between schwestern are not meant to be romantic. As Sumika mentions that Mitsuki and Hime have become close friends, Kanoko insists that she's Hime's only friend. Sumika's response reduces Kanoko to tears.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Kanoko-chan. I know what it means to worry about a friend, but if you try to monopolize her like that, Hime-chan's just going to end up hating you."

Miki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">who had previously admired Fujishiro</a>, demands an explanation as Izumi leads Kurokawa away.

Superman is visibly shocked and disoriented by this answer for a while.

<div class="indent"><strong>Doctor Manhattan:</strong> "In the end"? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing <em>ever</em> ends.
</div></li><li> Similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em> example, when Dan and Rorschach are reminiscing about their time as crime-fighting partners:
<div class="indent"><strong>Dan:</strong> Those were great times, Rorschach. Great times. Whatever happened to them? <br/><strong>Rorschach:</strong> You quit.
</div></li><li> Also at the beginning of the book, Edward Blake, known as The Comedian delivers a rather long-winded one to Dr. Manhattan. For context, The Comedian had callously dismissed a Vietnamese woman he'd gotten pregnant, resulting in her slashing his face with a bottle and him shooting her dead in retaliation. The Comedian then notices how Dr. Manhattan, who did nothing besides weakly protest against the murder, is sliding away from his own humanity:
<div class="indent"><strong>Blake:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Pregnant woman. Gunned her down. Bang. And y'know what? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction">You watched me</a>.

Soon you won't be interested in Sally Jupiter's little gal, either. You're driftin' outta touch, Doc. You're turning into a flake. God help us all.

During this, he engages in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuck">The Reason You Suck</a> speech where he attempts to deconstruct Batman dressing up like a monster and inspiring fear. After going on about that, Joker asks why Batman leaves his chin uncovered, allowing a glimpse at the man beneath the suit and thus showing that despite the appearance, Batman isn't a monster. Batman responds, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"To <em>mock</em> you."</span> Joker immediately flips out. The response is made more powerful because this is Batman's <em>only</em> line in the whole story.

Unfortunately for Lex, he's not prepared for Superman to come back with just seven words that not only completely undermine his whole speech, but his confidence in his whole philosophy (and just like above this is the only line Superman has in the story):

After finally catching them as they were escaping from one of their targets, he's confronted by Batman, who tells him to drop out of the game. When Savant attempted to take the high and mighty road saying he's the one who caught the criminals and asked Batman what kept him busy from arresting them instead, Batman stuns him by telling him that he was safely evacuating everyone from the burning building the arsonists torched.

When Dream mutters sullenly that he would have made her a goddess, Death shoots back, "Maybe she didn't <em>want</em> to be a goddess, little brother. Did you ever consider <em>that?</em> Anyway, condemning her to an eternity in Hell, <em>just</em> because she turned you down...that's a <em>really</em> shitty thing to do." Her words wake Dream up to his being in the wrong here, so he decides to go to Hell to free Nada, which in turn sets so much in motion throughout the rest of the story...

Finally, however, the young Antean king, Aster, who was innocent of his country's crimes (the regent and the spider priests were the real culprits, and Aster did not have any actual power), speaks up and takes full responsibility, saying that it was his fault because he was not strong enough to stop it. He concludes by saying "If the [Elassans] feel that there has to be more blood, say so. You can kill as many of us as you need to make it right. Give me a number, and I'll bring them to you. I only ask that you start with me....I'm sorry that I wasn't strong enough to stop this sooner." At this, the Elassan commander can only bring himself to say "Well...shit."

Bartlett proceeds to cite several Bible verses which state religious laws that are no longer practiced (selling a daughter into slavery, working on the Sabbath being punishable by death, etc.) before concluding with this.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bartlett</strong>: While you may be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">Ignorant Tight-Ass Club</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoYouThinkYouAre">in this building</a> when the president stands, <em>nobody</em> sits.
</div></li><li> Bartlet's on the receiving end of one from Will Bailey during the build-up to a State of the Union address, which is coinciding with an outbreak of ethnic cleansing in a Rwanda-like nation in Africa that his administration is dragging its feet on dealing with. Having stopped by Will's office to discuss the State of the Union with him, Bartlet's thoughts drift to the ethnic cleansing, and he rhetorically asks why it seems like a genocide in Europe (or a similarly 'white' area) seems more important to him and his government than one occurring in Africa. He's not prepared for Bailey to bluntly reply "I don't know, sir, but it is."
</li><li> In one episode, Dr. Abbey Bartlett is frustrated by the prospect of temporarily losing her medical license for covering up the President's MS by giving him secret injections of drugs. During her birthday party, she slips away with C.J., Donna, and Amy to have a few drinks and share some girl talk. Amy and C.J. point out that license or no license, Abbey's still done incredible work for women, holds a position of power (First Lady) that will allow her to continue to do so, and will eventually be able to practice again, so what's the big deal? Abbey replies that for all of that, she's still a doctor, and losing her license hurts—and that's when Donna remarks "Oh, Mrs. Bartlett, for crying out loud, you were <em>also</em> a doctor when your husband said 'Give me the drugs and don't tell anybody,' and you said 'Okay.'" The room goes completely silent, but it does help Abbey realize the scope of what she did, and prompts her to voluntarily give up her license for the remainder of her time in the White House.

<ul><li> When Batman confronts Amanda Waller about Project Cadmus, she breaks it down to him just how exactly the world governments feel about an army of metahumans and their downward-pointing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>.

</li><li> Justice League Batman argues with Justice Lord Batman, his alternate universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> counterpart, calling him out on being a tyrannical and oppressive dictator. Lord Batman points out that under said dictatorship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">no eight-year-old boy ever has to fear seeing his parents gunned down in an alley</a>. League Batman immediately drops his Batarang and sadly declares "You win".
<ul><li> Justice League Batman gets back at Justice Lord Batman later. When a man is arrested for "causing a disturbance" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">complaining about his restaurant bill</a>, the former sarcastically points out that Mom and Dad would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">so</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou">proud of him</a> for what he has helped create.
</li><li> In the director commentary, Lord Batman's armor piercing response was this for the writing team as well. To write the scene, they had divided the writing staff into two teams. Both teams were to argue as if they were Batman, one team as if Batman was justifying his questionable own act, while the other team argued as Batman denouncing a villain. The Lord team made the same argument and the entire writing team fell silent realizing the implication: They had wanted Team Denouncing Villain to win... but they had nothing to back it up... the second scene was written specifically to point out the problem once everyone thought about it.
</li></ul></li><li> General Wade Eiling takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> serum and mutates into a Hulk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> so he can publicly defeat Superman.
