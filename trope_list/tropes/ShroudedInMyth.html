Like that he's thirty feet tall and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">shoots lightning bolts out of his arse</a>. Sure, there's a kernel of truth in there somewhere, but who even knows where or what it might be with all the stories surrounding the truth.

</li><li> The wildly conflicting rumors about Vash from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> become an issue in the very first episode.

Many of the rumors about Vash in the first episode could just as easily describe the 12-foot tall criminal Descartes.
<ul><li> This culminates in a showdown between Descartes, the bounty hunter Loose Ruth, and (sort of) Vash, with Ruth and Descartes believing each other to be the real deal pretty much solely because they both wear red and have blond hair.
</li><li> Later, the conflicting rumors allow a nameless crook to impersonate Vash convincingly because he wears sunglasses and has spiky hair.

The rumors were started by the other members of his dojo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who don't know that Jin killed Mariya in self-defense</span> and have grown out of all proportion with reality...although Jin's still good enough to defeat almost everyone who tries to challenge him based on that outsize reputation.
</li><li> In one episode, a couple of bystanders are rapping about the doings of the ghost of Yoshitsune (a legendary 12th century samurai general around whom similar legends grew in real life), and how he supposedly haunts a nearby mountain. As it turns out in the episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was all a combination of rumors about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter">The Drifter</a> Okuru and Jin, the latter of which were deliberately spread by his former schoolmate Yukimaru</span>.

<ul><li> And an OVA features a spell Shrouded in Myth that can summon a meteor. And then promptly demonstrates why the spell is only a legend (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aiming from space is hard enough that the spell is inaccurate to the point of uselessness</span>).

To hear the legends, he's a ruthless delinquent maniac and a strung-out heroin addict who <em>will</em> kill you if you cross him and is unbeatable in combat.

<ul><li> Back in the '70's, they used to have issues devoted to people telling Batman stories that grew more and more disconnected from reality. Often it was revealed that the teller of the scariest story was Batman himself in disguise.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Legends of the Dark Knight" explored this concept with three kids who tell stories of different versions of Batman that aren't true to life... but are actually based on previous versions of the character from the comics. Also, in "Almost Got Him", some villains briefly discuss various possibilities of who/what Batman is.
<ul><li> Something similar happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanGothamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanGothamKnight">Batman: Gotham Knight</a></em>, where one of the kids encountered Batman and was left with the impression that he was some kind of robot; another thought he was some sort of shadow-creature; and the last thought he was a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Bat-Man</a>.
</li><li> The comics story "The Batman Nobody Knows" has Bruce Wayne taking a group of inner-city kids on a camping trip. After they trade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallTale">tall tales</a> about Batman, he makes a real appearance. The kids are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">unimpressed</a>.
</li><li> In "Legend", a story set in the distant future by Walt Simonson for <em>Batman: Black and White</em>, a mother tells her young son about Batman, describing him as a larger than life figure with powers beyond those of mortal man. He could fly, breathe underwater, his suit was shiny and metal and fired missiles - and he would retreat to a solitary fortress when he needed to rest from his never-ending battle.
</li></ul></li><li> In more than one story, Superman has had to sub for an ailing Batman (or vice-versa). Because the criminals never see Batman coming and are knocked out, they assume "Superman" just used his speed, while the outlandish things "Batman" gets up to are accepted by small-time criminals because they're that superstitious about him.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em> as Carrie Kelly tells off her friend for telling outlandish stories about Batman, then sets the record straight that he's just a man, about twelve feet tall (365cm). This could also be a jab about the art, since Bats is almost twice her size in some panels.
</li><li> The entire point of <em>Batman, Inc</em> is to foster a dense network of rumor and suspicion around the identity of Batman — based around the fact that now, Batman is <em>everywhere</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar event happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em>, where several kids tell their version of who and what Aquaman is.

Another claims he lives a normal life only underwater, even having his own aquadog, and is also a superhero. Another says Aquaman is a giant made completely of water. Again, the funny thing here is that they're all technically correct; Those have all been different versions of the character in continuity before.

The fact of the matter, however, is that they're all being played for chumps by their own comrade, the Insecticon kleptomaniac Chop Shop, who contributes to the rumors and even "steals" from himself to mask his deeds.

His rep is just large enough that he himself is a small celebrity as a con man in the UK, a master mage in the occult world, and the feared Hellblazer in the underworld. Sometimes, even the government and members of the public ask him for help in some supernatural happenings.

His reputation for being impossible to kill (eyewitness reports of surviving multiple gunshots, knife wounds, shrapnel explosions...) led superstitious crooks to worry that he was a ghost come to bring them to justice from beyond the grave. This is supported by the widely held belief that Greyshirt is the long-thought deceased Franklin Lafayette. The wide variety of physical aptitudes he holds, from tremendous brawling ability to dancing that draws comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly">Gene Kelly</a>, and the fact that many experts come to different conclusions when analyzing his romantic history, only heighten his mystique.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, most members of the vigilante group called the Minutemen have had the details of their lives documented, and their identities and fates are public knowledge. The exception is Hooded Justice, who was not only one of the original (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">and most brutal</a>) of the masked vigilantes, but also the most secretive and aloof, which invited much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> speculation about him. This only increased when Hooded Justice responded to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee">summoned to a Congressional committee on vigilante heroes</a> by refusing to attend and vanishing without a trace, and even Hooded Justice's former teammate/bitter enemy turned government super agent The Comedian claimed to have been able to find no clues about Hooded Justice's identity or whereabouts. Hollis Mason (another old teammate from the Minutemen) speculated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument">his book about the group</a> that Hooded Justice was a German-American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrongman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrongman">circus strongman</a> named Rolf Muller, noting that Muller was one of the few people who could match Hooded Justice's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">height, build, and strength</a>, and that Muller also disappeared at around the same time as Hooded Justice. Furthermore Muller's background would explain some of Hooded Justice's actions, and Muller was a known Nazi sympathizer, which is another reason why, if Muller and Hooded Justice were one and the same, he would want nothing to do with testifying before the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">House UnAmerican Activities Committee</a>. (There's also speculation that The Comedian only claimed to have been unable to find anything on Hooded Justice, and that Comedian actually killed the man, covered it up, then claimed to have found nothing.) On a more meta level this has also extended to real life, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> has alternated between responding to fan questions about Hooded Justice with fairly plausible answers, and at other times his responses come off more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a>. (For example, Moore has said that Muller <em>might</em> be Hooded Justice... and that Muller might have just been one of many aliases and identities for a man who was spying on America for the Nazis. Or the Soviets. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent">Or both at once</a>.)

<ul><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado">Desperado</a></em>, where the hero has a friend going around to bars and telling people tall tales about him.
</li><li> This trope is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunfighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGunfighter">The Gunfighter</a></em>, as that film presents the reputation of being "the fastest draw in the West" as a huge burden, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the point where the hero basically curses his killer with it at the end</span>.
</li><li> Hickey, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> gunman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for the Irish Mob in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em>, has this sort of reputation, and seems to hint in one scene that he encourages it.
</li><li> Tyler Durden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em> draws this sort of reputation. It's particularly noticeable when the narrator tries to track him down and find that Tyler's cult-like legend has been growing every step of the way, with wild stories about him everywhere.
<ul><li> Some of them are probably true; for example, according to one rumour he only sleeps three hours a night. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That pretty much has to be the case so that he can get anything done, when the narrator hogs his body half the time.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>:

</li><li> Bane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> is a larger-than-life figure, even to the people of the prison where his story began. The myths are so deeply layered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nobody realizes many of the stories are also about Talia instead</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThingsIHateAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThingsIHateAboutYou">10 Things I Hate About You</a></em>, this reputation quickly grows around Patrick Verona. Among other things, he's purported to have sold his liver and eaten a live duck.
</li><li> The Dread Pirate Roberts is just such a figure in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>.
</li><li> The Sphinx in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen">Mystery Men</a></em>. In a bit of a subversion, everything that had been said about him was <em>true</em>. Plus, he can, like, cut guns in half with his mind.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em>, William Wallace develops this reputation. When he identifies himself to his fellow Scots before a battle, one man challenges him, saying that the real William Wallace is over 7 feet tall. Without missing a beat Wallace sarcastically replies "Aye, so I've heard. He kills men by the hundreds, and if <em>he</em> were here, he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse". The last line has become completely associated with this trope both being played straight and being mocked.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded">How It Should Have Ended</a></em> version <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcoVxbutl8g&amp;list=SL">this is exactly what happens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Notably, the real Wallace was very large and tall; though his exact height is undetermined, it was probably not much less than seven feet. Part of the purpose of the scene in the film was to invoke this trope in order to lend credence to his being played by 5' 10" Mel Gibson. Hamish, his second, is actually pretty close to the historic Wallace in appearance though.

Unlike most characters on here, Söze lives up to the myths.
<ul><li> Or does he? After all, most of what we know of him comes from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">the man himself</a></span>.

Although it is implied that he eventually became somewhat like the legend after being the one who made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">First Contact</a> with the Vulcans because of his invention.

Hitler is clearly very, very nervous and upset. This is <em>Hitler</em> we're talking about here.

<ul><li> This trope also applies to Rand himself, who eventually seems to be treated as some kind of demigod or demon by people from the other end of the continent who have only heard mad rumours about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">giant man-eating warrior women</a> who serve as his bodyguards. Although that particular rumour was voiced by someone who lived in the <em>same city</em> in which Rand was holding court at the time—Jordan is probably making a point about how myths get created (which ties in which the way the world thinks about the Dragon and the Age of Legends), sometimes ending the main part of the book before the epilogue with a comment about how the cataclysmic event would mutate in the telling, on one such occasion even stating that, most unusually, it was something fairly close to the truth that was most widely believed. This really kicks Rand in the arse down the line as even childhood friends of his believe monstrous tales about him (which are usually unfairly slanted against him even when they contain a grain of truth).
<ul><li> The tales about Rand's specific deeds range from dead-on to wildly inaccurate, but when it comes to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> status, by the end if anything he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">even</a> more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">powerful</a> than the stories.

Rincewind tends to resent his reputation for always escaping danger not because it is untrue <em>per se</em>, but because people assume he then must be a great hero who defeats his enemies, rather than his deliberate, actual attempts to be a well-planned (but breathing) coward.

</div></li><li> Similar rumors swirl around Vimes in several books. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em>, his traveling party's killing seven bandits leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution">Gossip Evolution</a> claiming that <em>he</em> did it alone, and it was thirty men — and a dog. When Vimes leaves the city, the crime rate goes <em>down</em> — because most criminals think that if they make too much of a mess, he would be unhappy and clean it up personally. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>, a foreign country dubs Vimes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher">The Butcher</a>" for propaganda reasons. Vetinari himself also banks on the unspoken but generalized fear of Vimes both criminals and nobles have, knowing that some insinuations would be true if not for the steps Vimes takes to control himself.
</li><li> The issue with Vimes is that even the honest truth of his exploits sound like overblown tall tales: "Sam Vimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">once arrested Vetinari for treason</a>. Sam Vimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">once arrested a dragon</a>. Sam Vimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">stopped a war between nations by arresting two high commands</a>.

The Assassins' Guild <em>refuses</em> contracts on Sam Vimes." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">And that's not to mention that he arrested an</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> within himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">by sheer force of autodiscipline</a>. And he doesn't even know it. It's mentioned in passing at least once that city police forces that pattern themselves like the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are often called "Sammies" (even in areas where most people haven't heard of him), in part thanks to the Ankh-Morpork trained watchmen who leave the city to take up officer positions elsewhere. (Presumably a reference to the fact that British police officers are nicknamed "Bobbies" in reference to Robert Peel, the man who wrote the <strike> book</strike> precepts on How To Be A Good Copper.) Most recently, he's become something of a demon amongst some dwarves (for whom his most impressive title is not 'Duke' nor 'Commander' but 'Blackboard Monitor').
</li><li> Also on the Discworld is Lu Tze. His deeds as an agent of the History Monks are so legendary among the few who know of the secret society that no apprentice who hears the tales suspects that Lu Tze is actually one of the temple's janitors. Even when learning the truth, it can be tempting to discount the stories or underestimate him... until you find out why Rule One on Discworld is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">"Never act incautiously when confronted by a small, old, wrinkly, bald smiling man!"</a>
</li><li> Powerful witches on the Discworld, such as Black Aliss, the ultimate wicked witch, and Granny Weatherwax, the ultimate <em>good</em> witch, tend to get shrouded in myth. Miss Treason from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wintersmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wintersmith">Wintersmith</a></em> shrouds <em>herself</em> in myth (as part of what she calls "Boffo", the power of becoming what people expect) in order to gain respect as a witch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> parodies this.

All of which is true; she's also been Warlord of the Empire more times than anyone can keep track of, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is older than civilization, and has turned down an offer to become a god</span>. If anything, the myths undersell her. She turns out to be surprisingly nice given this.
</li><li> Mario Greymist is supposed to be the greatest assassin ever <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and when Vlad meets him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dzur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dzur">Dzur</a></em>, he is a portly middle-aged man in appearance</span>. Still quite ready and willing to kick ass, though.

It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being Santiago (and the head of Santiago's crime family) is actually a <em>position</em>, handed down much like being the Dread Pirate Roberts was, and that no individual Santiago has lasted in the job more than ten years... and that each individual Santiago was an expert in different fields and of different physical description, thus creating most of Santiago's reputation as an unkillable omni-talented man of a thousand faces</span>.
<ul><li> And given the events of <em>The Return of Santiago</em>, where several of the galaxy's most talented criminals find out the truth about the original Santiago myth and decide to secretly resume the scam over a hundred years later, the myth cycle of Santiago has expanded to include the ability to return from the dead.
</li><li> Penelope Bailey, the Soothsayer (or the Oracle, or the Prophet), in a trilogy of novels by the same author. By the end of the first book, her reputation has grown immensely and only continues to do so throughout the other two books. Subverted in that all of the legends told about her, however fantastical, massively <em>understated</em> the actual truth — which was that her abilities to see the future and manipulate probability bordered on both omniscience and omnipotence.
</li><li> Santiago's reputation was done no harm by Black Orpheus giving him no less than forty verses in an epic poem where three marks you as one of the biggest badasses in the universe, with lines like:
<div class="indent"><em>His father was a comet</em> <br/><em>His dam a cosmic wind.</em> <br/><em>God wept when first He saw him</em> <br/><em>But Satan merely grinned.</em>

However, he is a novice who barely knows the basics of Magik.
<ul><li> Most of his early instruction, both by his original teacher and in the first few books, is composed half of showmanship designed to attain the reputation and rewards of a master, and half of the attitude and conscience which it's stated by the second book is as integral to that rank as the technical skill. This is probably critical to the reputation in that it gives actual professionals reasons to respect him instead of trying to expose him as a fraud.
</li><li> And then there's the dimension of Perv. In Perv, magic and technology are balanced out, which attracted so many visitors that the natives were almost overwhelmed. After getting rid of the non-contributing outsiders, the Pervects started a negative ad-campaign, spreading many bad rumors about Perv to scare off any prospective tourist; things like Pervects eat their enemies and/or indulge in unpleasant sexual practices to name a few. And given how nasty your average Pervect can be in casual conversation, there's no way to tell what's real and what's fabricated, and no one wants to find out.

By the third book, someone has taken to writing fictionalised versions of his already fairly impressive accomplishments that portray him as seven feet tall, and looking something akin to a Greek god. Needless to say, people tend to be somewhat disappointed on meeting him in person.

In private, he jokes about it; early in <em>High Deryni</em>, he recounts a peasant rumour that he has cloven hooves.

Green has a reputation of such mythic proportions that he's essentially weaponized it. He defeats many enemies just by introducing himself.

I paid for it" on at least one occasion. Later in life he admits to his son that he has found his murderous reputation a "mixed damnation". Ironically, he actually has committed murderous crimes—just not the ones he's accused of.
</li><li> The reputation of ImpSec has travelled all the way to Jackson's Whole where Great Houses make up bogey stories about it.

Of course, exactly how false this is, given the Ghosts' competence—and those three in particular—is not known, as the exact details of the event are not told to us readers.
<ul><li> In <em>Armor Of Contempt</em>, Landerson explains that the Gereon Resistance deliberately attributed all sorts of feats — including those performed by others — to Mkvenner to build up his myth in the eyes of the Chaos occupying forces. Consider that in <em>Traitor General</em> it was revealed that he had been taught by the mysterious, deemed legendary Nalsheen on Tanith, only fitting.

They had no clue that the story was really about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">unassuming innkeeper</a> who's been serving their beer for the past year.

Unfortunately his tremendous legend caused him to grow increasingly complacent, confident that his terrifying image was enough to keep people in line.

</li><li> The Series 9 story arc pivots on the question of the identity of the Hybrid, a creature of Gallifreyan folklore that is said to be the ultimate warrior, half-one species and half-another, who might save or destroy all.

</li></ul></li><li> This happens to John in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> as time goes on and he racks up more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> adventures.
<ul><li> First in "Suns and Lovers" while pretending not to know who "John Crichton" is. The act is ruined pretty quickly by John's need to set the record straight:
<div class="indent"><strong>Borlik</strong>: You know, I heard he destroyed a Peacekeeper Gammak Base, murdered an entire Nebari battalion, even laid waste to a Shadow Depository. The guy was a devil: he raped and pillaged, he popped eyeballs- <br/><strong>Crichton</strong>: Whoa-whoa! Where do they get these stories? Let's set the facts straight. First off, there was no raping, very little pillaging, and Frau Blucher popped all the eyeballs.
</div></li><li> Happens again in "Scratch and Sniff" when an alien who has been playing Crichton and D'Argo from the start reveals her game when she realizes the stories are a bit...exaggerated:
<div class="indent"><strong>Raxil</strong>: <em><strong>2 guns</strong></em>? I mean - I thought you were the Great Crichton &amp; D'Argo! I mean - you blew up a shadow depository! I thought you'd bring pelshfer charges! And a plasma bomb! And a really big gunship! BUT NO! YOU BRING NOTHING! YOU BRING 2 LITTLE WEAPONS THAT WOULDN'T KILL A NIKNIK! <br/><strong>D'Argo</strong>: (hesitantly) You - have heard of us? <br/><strong>Raxil</strong>: Yeah - I've heard stories. But obviously they aren't worth a bucket of dren!
</div></li><li> You know, for escaping prisoners who don't want to be caught, they do call an awful lot of attention to themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em>, the mysterious Beast of Craggy Island causes some especially odd rumors, such as: It has four ears, two are for listening and two are sort of back-up ears. Some of the ears are on the inside of its head. For some reason it has a tremendous fear of stamps. Its yawn sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson">Liam Neeson</a> chasing a load of hens around inside a barrel. Instead of a face, it has four arses.
</li><li> An in-universe example on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>: In "Jaynestown", Jayne is regarded as a folk hero shrouded in myth by the working-class mudders of Canton, and even given a statue and a song in his honor. (The song is apparently sung nightly at the bar.) Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they think he dropped a bunch of money in their town square because he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">Robin Hood type</a> in reality, he was just trying to escape and had to push the money out of the ship. He even pushed his partner out first.</span>
<ul><li> It actually goes farther than that. In the Serenity comic <em>Better Days</em>, the crew gains an absolute <em>shitload</em> of money. Now having enough cash to be able to waste some, Jayne gives a handful of bills to a monk, who then remarks: "The Hero of Canton... he's real!" This is happening on a <em>completely different planet.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Facts from the distant past are prone to be embellished into legends. For instance, Aegon the Conqueror forged the Iron Throne from less than two hundred swords rather than the reputed thousand. However, George R.R. Martin's original vision of the Iron Throne is <em>much</em> more monstrous than the show version, with the thousand swords apparently meant literally.
</li><li> After curb-stomping his enemies twice, Robb quickly becomes an in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> accused of Lycanthropy because his pet direwolf fought beside him.
</li><li> Because this trope is acknowledged in-universe, some characters are suspicious of magical things that actually exist, such as dragons and White Walkers. For the first few seasons, Daenerys' dragons are commonly dismissed as just a story by people who have not seen them.
</li><li> Events surrounding Lyanna Stark's abduction remain a mystery to this very day.
</li><li> Nobody has a clue where exactly House Reed's stronghold is, or what their members look like except Bran, Rickon, Osha, and Hodor (well, the latter part at least) because Jojen and Meera personally looked for them. Greywater Watch, their "castle", is a crannog  basically a really large floating artificial island/houseboat. Thus it <em>moves</em>, and during times of war, they just pull it back deeper into the swamps.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, Arizona has survived enough near-death experiences she's reputed to <em>be immortal</em>, and the interns regard her as a legendary figure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, Monroe mentions to Nick that the Grimm have become the monsters in Wesen Fairy Tales, due to their long history of decapitating Wesen simply for the crime of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrime">being</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Wesen</a>. It helps that the Grimm ability to see a Wesen changing into their half-wog form (normally invisible to humans) has a side effect of scaring the pants off the Wesen in question. It is not clear whether this is biological or supernatural in nature but it has the effect of making a Wesen who never met a Grimm instantly believe in all the horror stories he/she heard.
<div class="indent"><strong>Monroe</strong>: You're the monster under the bed! [...] You're not <em>real!</em> You're a scary story we tell our kids!

He's said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">at least 5,000 years old</a>, (this part is true, the man himself claims that further back than that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges">his memory starts to turn into a blur</a>, so even he has no idea how <em>much</em> older than 5,000 he is) and when you put together all the stories about him, they all contradict each other in everything from his physical description, his deeds, his personality, etc. The truth about Methos has been so obscured that in the present day even other Immortals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher">the Watchers Organization</a> (the sole group of mortals who are clued in to the existence of Immortals and have been cataloging the history of Immortals for millennia) think Methos is just a myth or a collection of legends about different Immortals that have falsely been attributed to one person. Of course, it helps when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">the subject is deliberately invoking this</a>; it turns out Methos infiltrated the Watchers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredToHuntYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredToHuntYourself">became the leading expert on himself</a>, viewed by other Watchers as the greatest authority on the legend of Methos, then deliberately played with the different stories and descriptions of himself so that they would say what he wanted them to say, and omit what he wanted them to omit. Part of what Methos wanted was for it to be impossible to put together a coherent picture of who Methos is or even what he looks like. For Methos the best way to make sure nobody came after the Oldest Immortal in a bid to take his head <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers">and claim his power for themselves</a> is to make sure nobody is looking for him... and that even those who are can't find him, even with all the information in the world at their fingertips.

</li><li> Just check out the following quote to see how people <em>in</em> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> universe see Gibbs.
<div class="indent">"What have you heard? That bad guys would rather confess than be interrogated by him? That his steely gaze can cool a room by five degrees? That he can only be killed by a silver bullet, like a werewolf? They're all true, except for the silver bullet part. Might give him indigestion or heartburn, but I don't think it'd kill him. Any other questions?"
</div><ul><li> Also this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Timothy McGee:</strong> I've heard stories about Special Agent Gibbs. <br/><strong>Tony:</strong> Only half of them are true...the trick is figuring out which half.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Henrietta "Hetty" Lang in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> also receives this treatment amongst the intel community, even having enough favor to summon a pair of fighter jets just to scare a militia group in one episode. "G" Callen also gets this due to his covert work, and the fact that nobody, <em>not even Callen himself</em>, knows his first name. A villain actually uses the latter to coerce G into obeying his phone instructions by saying "I know what the 'G' stands for."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S3E7TheCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S3E7TheCamp">The Camp</a>", none of the human slaves have ever seen one of the New Masters, the alien race that conquered Earth twelve generations earlier. During an uprising two generations earlier, one man caught a glimpse of the world outside the huge wall that surrounds the camp and supposedly told the father of Prisoner 91777 what he saw: scorched Earth, black steel and New Masters everywhere. The New Masters were alleged to be three times the size of a human with four arms and razor teeth. The Commandant reveals that the New Masters abandoned Earth 100 years earlier, meaning that they were gone by the time of the uprising. After another, more successful uprising, the slaves open the gate and see that the landscape is lush and green.
</li><li> In the sequel "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S4E21PromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1995S4E21PromisedLand">Promised Land</a>", some of the very few New Masters (known as the Tsal-Khan) who remained on Earth after the evacuation are seen and it is readily apparent that the stories about their appearance had been greatly exaggerated: although they are vaguely reptilian, they are the same size of humans, have two arms and their teeth don't seem to be any more or less sharp than the average human's. Given that humans are believed to have all died out, similar legends have grown up around them. T'sha teases his younger brother Ma'al by telling him that the woods are filled with humans with razor teeth and claws like hooks who hunt in packs.
</li></ul></li><li> Mention is made in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> of the first hacker, who broke into and crashed the early DARPANET at a time when most people didn't know that there was such a thing as an internet, and this action is why the net exists for the public today. A comment made by Finch at the end of the episode where this first comes up revealed that hacker to be Harold himself, as a high school student fooling around with a home-made computer and a plastic whistle he used for phone phreaking.

<ul><li> Early on, we meet one of the heroes of the Bajoran Resistance movement, whom the new Bajoran government wants to replace Major Kira with as liaison to the Federation. He's competent, but many of his successes are good luck and more are just stories; the example given being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">a particularly notorious Cardassian military officer</a> whose death was made out to be some kind of epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>... when in fact they walked into each other as said Cardassian was getting out of the lake where he'd been taking a swim, shot him before he could grab the sidearm he'd left next to his clothes and didn't even realise who the guy was until later. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He soon dies a heroic death.</span>
</li><li> One episode dealt with them stumbling across a hidden colony established by a time-displaced version of the main crew. One group lives in the Klingon way, as hunters and warriors, revering their biological and/or spiritual ancestor Worf, "The Son of Mogh", about whom many legends are told. When a boy who hopes to grow up to join them asks Worf if it's true he can kill a man just by looking at him, after a brief pause, Worf puts on a stern expression and clarifies: "Only when I am angry."
</li><li> Another episode had O'Brien and Bashir debating how Davy Crockett met his end at the Alamo, specifically whether he tried to surrender before being killed. Worf interrupts and invokes the importance of this trope, arguing that if they truly believe in his legend there should be no question he died as a hero, but if they don't, Crockett would be just a man, and the details of his death wouldn't matter.
</li><li> One episode dealt with this, bringing back Kor. The crew of the Klingon ship (barring Martock, who held a grudge against the man for denying him the chance to be an officer), was in utter awe of the Dahar Master. However, Kor was <em>old</em>, and dementia was setting in. At one point of the battle, Kor had to take over command, but thought he was fighting one his legendary battles and nearly got the entire crew killed.

Part of the reason "This Extraordinary Being" is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the universe of the series, the relationship with Captain Metropolis is the <em>only</em> accurate piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> speculation as recurring character Will Reeves, a still-living 100+ year old African-American former cop, is revealed to be Hooded Justice, possibly making him the sole surviving Minuteman.</span>

<ul><li> This has been applicable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> for a certain degree throughout his career, right up to the present day. While a good amount of details about his private life have always been known, Dylan has always done his best to mystify fans and press. At the start of his career he often gave wildly varying accounts of his origins, and he's known for verbally sparring with interviewers in the mid-60's, answering their questions in confusing and enigmatic ways. After his motorcycle crash in 1966 he spent years running away from the limelight, and has never fully stopped doing so. These days, though still on his so-called Neverending Tour, he rarely gives any interviews, and his uncharacteristic release of a completely traditional Christmas album in 2009 shows he hasn't lost his knack for doing what people least expect him to.
<ul><li> Part of his mystique is the varying public images he's taken on throughout his career. The aloof, sneering rock star in shades of the mid-60's might be hard to reconcile with the shy, humble folk singer he started out as, or the Feliniesque vagrant in white clown-makeup of the '75 Rolling Thunder Revue, the preachy Born Again Christian of the early 80's or the old, dishevelled bluesman with the silly hat and pencil moustache he's become during the past ten years.

By the end of the game, people are cowering in awe from the man/woman who supposedly slew a dragon with a rusty spoon and uses the Arishok's skull as a gravy-boat.
<ul><li> Equally subverted when some antagonists in the game don't believe the stories they've heard about Hawke, only to realise that those are the ones that are actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">true</a></em>.

Due to the tales about the Champion of Kirkwall growing with each retelling, Cassandra has been forced to seek out the source, Varric, in order to discern the fact behind the fiction, due to her believing that Hawke worked to begin a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> between mages and templars that is beginning to engulf all of Thedas. Unfortunately for her, he turns out to be something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Unreliable Expositor</a> who feels he has no reason to trust her (and the most significant lie wouldn't be uncovered until well into the sequel).

</li><li> The Qunari are an example of this in-universe. Before their arrival in Par Vollen from an unknown continent, roughly three hundred years ago, no-one in Thedas had ever heard of them and - due to their reluctance to reveal much of themselves to those outside the Qun, their unwillingness to rarely allow people to venture to Par Vollen, as well as their fiercely kept technological and military secrets - very little has been learnt since. Furthermore, because female Qunari don't serve in the military, for nearly two centuries it was believed their species was solely male, until scholars were given the chance to visit Par Vollen and dispel that myth. Even they are pretty fuzzy about their origins; they know that they broke off from the Kossith and there's a vague idea of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadingRefugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadingRefugees">Invading Refugees</a>, but they don't even know if that's an old name for their race or a competing religion or what.

<ul><li> The legend also winds up oddly inverted, according to the logs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>. Some of the Federation Marines apparently consider the various exploits of Samus Aran, and even her very existence, to be only slightly more credible than fairy tales:
<div class="indent"><strong>PFC Crany:</strong> Last night at chow, Angseth starts talking about some bounty hunter and how she blew up a planet full of Space Pirates. I told her I didn't believe in fairy tales like that, and she took it personal. I just find it hard to believe that one person took out an entire Space Pirate base, that's all. But if she wants to believe in this Samus, or Bigfoot, or Santa Claus, she can.
</div></li><li> The Space Pirates, not to be outdone, have grown Samus into their cultural mythology as a one-woman demonic grim reaper.

<ul><li> In the <em>X-2</em> sequel, it's shown that the events of the original game are Shrouded in Myth. Everybody knows that Yuna is the High Summoner who- accompanied by several guardians- defeated Sin <strong>permanently</strong>.

During the Allied advance, the rumor that Skorzeny (and/or a unit he led) had infiltrated the American forces led to the entire advance being held up while people questioned each other to prove they weren't the infiltrator(s), leading to a trope about soldiers asking each other questions about the World Series and so on to prove their bona fides as Americans.

</li><li> Any figures of folklore and myth are very popular subjects for this.
<ul><li> Consider especially the number of books claiming to uncover the historical Jesus of Nazareth, as contrasted with the theological Jesus Christ.

And then there's the theories on just what his relationship was with Mary Magdalene, the circumstances of his death... best stop there.

Rumor has it that Hitler became quite concerned about the enigmatic warrior's ability to infiltrate Nazi installations, and German officers ordered their men to secure any opponents named Kilroy for a thorough interrogation.
<ul><li> Other rumor has it that he was just an Army grunt sick of the Air Force bragging that they got there first, no matter where "there" was. So he started leaving "Kilroy was here" scrawled everywhere he could think of so that when the Air Force got there, oops! Kilroy got there first.
</li><li> Conversely, according to snopes, Kilroy was an inspector who got tired of his supervisors not believing that he had inspected some out of the way place on a ship or vehicle, so he started putting "Kilroy was Here" in places that could be seen easily, but to write it there would require actually worming your way into place. That way he'd only have do to the inspection once. Other GIs, stumped by Kilroy's ability to be there first (get a new tank, kilroy was here was written on it) began scrawling it themselves, and the various resistance movements picked it up from them.
</li><li> The truth: James Kilroy was indeed a construction inspector, only he worked at the shipyard in Fall River, Massachusetts. His "Kilroy was here" marks were an attempt to cut down on fraud by riveters paid piecework rates. Many soldiers traveled to war on Fall River-built ships and it wouldn't have taken all that many of them to pick up on "Kilroy was here" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">spread it all over Europe</a>.

Adding to the mystery are MLB Player X, NBA Player X, and NASCAR Driver X. Gah, <em>who</em> are they? The world will probably never know.
<ul><li> The Mag also notes that Kyle Farnsworth, voted by MLB players to be the baddest ass in the league, has this reputation around him. "I know he knows some shit. He's... he's some kind of blackbelt." It neither confirms nor denies whether he actually karate chopped a bear, though.
</li><li> NBA Player X clued many readers in to the existence of William Wesley, alias "World Wide Wes", often thought of as the most powerful man in the sports world... despite literally no one having a single clue what his actual job is or how he got so connected. Nobody knows who he works for or where he gets his money or what he really does at all - they just know that he's there at every finals/championship/bowl game, he's advising draft hopefuls, he's counselling players on the bench, and he's got custom Nikes - and even the people closest to him can do nothing but speculate.

Let's just note that archaeological evidence has not made it clear if the city most likely to be the one Homer described in the Iliad was destroyed in a war or by one of the many earthquakes you get in that part of the world. Also, the actual ruins of the city would seem to be too small for the size of the palace, population and garrison described, even taking into account the mostly hypothetical "lower city" (which was not enclosed by major fortifications). Not to mention that by all evidence would indicate that a great coalition of most Greek mini-states would have been next to impossible under the rudimentary state of politics of the Mycenean Age, even for less than the stipulated ten years of the war's duration.

The weapon was said to be extremely effective, and made such an impression that almost every incendiary device recorded in medieval European texts is called "Greek Fire", including Chinese and Mongol gunpowder weapons, which in addition to often-exaggerated contemporary accounts only added to the ensuing confusion about what Greek Fire actually was.

Since then, many have tried to find the exact formula to Greek Fire through experimentation, though nobody knows for sure what exactly the Byzantines used for it.
</li><li> Few tanks (or weapons for that matter) in history inspire as much fear and reverence than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>-era Tiger I. The German heavy tank was developed as a response to the lack of tanks comparable to French and British heavy tanks encountered during the Battle of France in the German army, and was deployed for the first time on the Eastern Front in late 1942. Heavily armored, and armed with an 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 cannon capable of destroying most Allied armored vehicle from ranges exceeding 2,000 yards, it caused a mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> reaction among Allied command, which spurred the development of several up-gunned and more heavily armored Allied tanks (such as the M26 Pershing and A41 Centurion) and anti-armor ammunition. Despite the fearsome reputation, it was far from perfect. The over-engineered nature of the tank and the sheer difficulty in transporting such a large fighting vehicle made it a considerable strain on the already-taxed logistics management of the German army, and were produced in too few numbers to impact the overall war effort on their own. In the years following the Second World War, the legend of the Tiger grew to such proportions that it has since gained the reputation as an invincible superweapon, spawning such myths as the "five Shermans to kill one Tiger" fable, and often used as the example of the supposed superiority of <em>all</em> German tanks against Allied fighting vehicles, especially the American Sherman tank.
