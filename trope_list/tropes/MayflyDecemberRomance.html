This plays on the very mundane fact a character will probably be long dead before another is, and the emotional issues it raises. How much this is alluded to is usually related to how concise the story which addresses it is. The most obvious way to address the issue is to even out the age-bracket on either end.

<ul><li> Frequently suspected to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">touchy subject</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, the matter is only obliquely referred to in original manga and an episode of the recent show featuring a ghost. This is tricky to pin down though, as we've seen the ladies at different ages for different reasons (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashbacks</a> to Heaven, magical effects, and so on) but it's a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> that the goddesses' Earthly bodies are technically projections of the universal computer Yggdrasil. Keiichi is <em>very</em> aware that he is destined to be with Belldandy for the rest of <em>his</em> life, not <em>hers</em>. Interestingly, he asked <em>Peorth</em> about this (in one of the later Manga arcs); he couldn't bear to ask Bell. She fondly answered that they never forget the people that they have met over the ages and cherish them all. In the original Japanese, it was implied that it was Keiichi's innate acceptance and understanding of their relative differences that was part of the attraction he presented to Belldandy and the other goddesses.
<ul><li> Ultimately, it was revealed that their relationship had stalled in its early stages due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yggdrasil purposefully interfering, as any form of intimate relationship is forbidden without first proving their willingness to accept the consequences</span>.
</li><li> In the past a bard who wished to see the ocean encountered a Lake Goddess and fell in love with her. He spent the rest of his mortal life at her lake before finally dying. Devastated, the Goddess severed the bond linking her to the lake so she could fulfill the bard's desire but was punished for abandoning her duty with eternal imprisonment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keiichi and Belldandy witness the tragedy as part of the trial</span>.
</li><li> Invoked by the Almighty(the Daitenkaicho) Tyr when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keiichi and Belldandy make it through the trial and through his own miraculous motorcycle run; Tyr argues that even when he accepts that Keiichi and Belldandy's union is secured, he leaves no doubt that not only Keiichi, but also Belldandy might come in the future to ask him to give Keiichi a status where they'd be together forevermore. Given that the terms of Keiichi's wish was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"forever", not "for the rest of my life"</a>, it could be argued this is less a possibility than an inevitability.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga <em>Beautiful People</em>, a vampire encounters an abandoned little girl while he's out "feeding". The little girl had apparently been abandoned for being of mixed heritage (she's a redhead with blue eyes in Japan). For reasons he doesn't understand, the vampire decides to care for her. The girl isn't perturbed by his vampiric nature; she merely feels sorry for him because he can't look at a blue sunny sky like she can, and she tells him that he just needs to look at her blue eyes to see the sky. As the decades go by, the two grow closer even as she grows older with the vampire growing weaker as well since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">he's abstaining from feeding on blood</a> for her sake though she continues to offer hers for <em>his</em> sake. Then one day she closed her beautiful blue eyes forever. The vampire doesn't grieve because he knows how to see her again. He opens the windows to the sunny blue sky...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, the relationship between Ichigo's parents, Isshin and Masaki, becomes this, once it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Isshin is a Soul Reaper. An <em>ex-captain</em> Soul Reaper. Keep in mind that Hitsugaya is physically in his early teens, but has lived long enough to be a human's grandfather. The adult-looking Isshin's got to be older than that.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan">Brigadoon: Marin and Melan</a></em>, where the young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Barrier Maiden</a> was sent to earth for her safety. She's taken in by a kind Japanese family, but her sense of time is much different from theirs, and she barely ages at all before the couple die. She also marries their grandson, and she explains that she would die before him and that she, technically, wasn't human. He doesn't care and they get married anyway. Again, she seems as if she's in her twenties by the time he's lying on her death bed in at least his seventies. In the manga, at least. In the anime, the situation was somewhat different (and in ways, a lot more confusing).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Mao is in love with C.C., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">an immortal woman</a> with the looks of an older teenager, who he's been with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">since he was six</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">out-of-control</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> (which she is immune to) gives him no other options <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">outside of her</a>.
</li><li> One of the main plot elements of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em>, as the Abh have double the lifespans of unmodified humans. There is greater focus on this in the manga.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em>, Akira Regendorf is a teenaged werewolf whose powers of regeneration means he may hope to see his third century before the ravages of time catches up with him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oj4r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oj4r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oj4r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(the Earth Clan Senate have been confirmed as atypical)</span>. However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireMonarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireMonarch">Vampire Monarch</a> Mina Tepes is already in her <em>fifth</em> century and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild">is still working on getting past puberty</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Modelock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Modelock">modelocking</a> herself in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a></span>.
</li><li> A variation of this trope appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>; according to the <a class="urllink" href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Daizenshuu">''Daizenshuu'',<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Saiyans have roughly the same lifespan as humans, the only difference being that they retain their youth. Vegeta and Bulma, for example, would probably die of old age around the same time, but Bulma will have aged much more visibly.
<ul><li> Flipped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> where Bulma is likely to live longer given she's regularly using the Dragon Balls to revert her age back down to 40.
</li></ul></li><li> Any romance with the Edels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElementalGelade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElementalGelade">Elemental Gelade</a></em> falls into this. Aside from a single-episode plot, this is mostly ignored.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Van Hohenheim and Trisha Elric</span> have this problem, and he is desperately searching for a way to become mortal so he can die with her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He succeeds.</span> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the first anime</a>, the problem is slightly different, because he's not so immortal after all.
</li><li> Hana, the 14-year-old girl (for most of the story) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaToAkuma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaToAkuma">Hana to Akuma</a></em> is in love with Vivi, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">demon</a> who will live centuries longer than her. Naturally, he is constantly tormented; he hates celebrating her birthday because it means she's closer to death, and frequently counts down her remaining years in panic. When he comes to return her romantic affection, he tries to leave to let her live a normal life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's futile, though, as he can't keep away and she's more than happy to continue their relationship. They marry, and she dies at an old age, having spent their life together. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> though, as she left him two children who have lifespans as long as his.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotarubiNoMoriE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotarubiNoMoriE">Hotarubi no Mori e</a></em> Hotaru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a> Gin ends up in romance as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">she grows up</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">goes straight</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, the title character is half-demon and thus is implied to live for centuries, while his love interest is a mortal human. The canon never brings up this fairly obvious problem, not even once, leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfiction">Fanfiction</a> to play with it in various ways. The manga author seems to like to avoid this problem, because it actually always occurs when a demon and a human come together. The demonic parents of Inuyasha and Shiori were killed by evil demons when their children were born straight. What became of the demonic parents of Jinenji and Gyu-oh is unknown.

Even Kuwabara and Yukina's relationship is that because ice maidens live for centuries and Kuwabara's just a human. Raizen's relationship with the doctor he met in human world counts too, especially since it's the whole final season's plot.

After one of them is killed, it is revealed that he has a private cemetery where he buries his deceased mortal lovers. Another Eternal, Vampiro, has a human wife. She is at peace with the idea that he will outlive her. Sersi also enjoys dalliances with mortals, but these tend to be flings and not long-term relationships.

The elves, magical immortal creatures, are the descendants of alien shapeshifters. After crash-landing on the planet with two moons, the aliens tried to survive: some by living as primitive humans, one by killing everything else, and one by turning into a wolf and becoming the ur-mother of a tribe of half-elf-half-wolf babies (a lot of which... didn't survive).
<ul><li> 10,000 years later, the comic's main character Cutter, a direct descendant of the mortal wolf-blood line, pairs up with Leetah, a pure immortal elf. Drama ensues.
</li><li> Heavily deconstructed during the second half of the main quest: another 10.000 years pass, during with most of the mortal elves decide to go into magical hibernation. One family of elves (who happen to look most like the "classical" elf of Western mythology) decide not to, and try to live a peaceful and fullfilling mortal life. The thing is — they just can't stop counting the years. Their youngest son, who was brought up by mortals in a tribe of immortals, decides that hibernation is a better alternative, because counting the years would make him go <em>insane</em>.
</li><li> And then Winnowill, the series' main villain, discovers that her healing powers allow her to make mortal elves immortal. Against their will. And teaches Leetah, the hero's lifemate, that her own healing powers would allow her to do the same. After being kidnapped 10,000 years into the future, and believing (with good reason) that all of their friends are dead, Skywise (the hero's best friend) asks Leetah to make him immortal... only to find out several <em>hours</em> later that everyone they know is still alive.
</li><li> At one point in the comic, Leetah is briefly — <em>very</em> briefly — tempted to "cleanse" Cutter in his sleep. She utterly hates herself for even thinking about it.
</li><li> Aside from the main characters, there are many, <em>many</em> mortal/immortal pairings in <em>ElfQuest</em>, and even three cases of humans being adopted by elves.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em>, when Omniman reveals his true background to Mark. He's an alien whose people live for thousands of years, and he claims to see Mark's mother as little more than a pet he will long outlive.

Some stories write it off by saying that all humans in the Underground age extremely slow.

<ul><li> This is a very common trope for shipping fanfics concerning the Princesses. Being the first two immortals (Alicorns) revealed so far, a common qualm about them getting into a relationship is usually along these lines, unless it is a yuri pairing of either of them with Twilight Sparkle, who has enough magic to presumably make herself immortal if she wanted to (or as of season 3, the fact she's an alicorn herself now), or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestYayShipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestYayShipping">each other</a>, a pairing known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">Princest</a>.
</li><li> Due to it being unclear how long a dragon's lifespan is, there's speculation a Spike/Rarity (or any Spike romance) relationship might wind up becoming this.
</li><li> Cadance is married to a unicorn. Fans are uncertain if their romance could be this. Cadance was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">born a pegasus</span> and aged appropriately throughout her fillyhood, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">Immortality Begins at 20</a> could be the answer for that.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a></em> addresses this by having Present!Rarity admitting she knows of Spike's crush on her but is afraid of mentioning it for this reason, as its established Spike <em>will</em> outlive her under normal circumstances. Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Dark World</a>, where Rarity was made immortal by Discord, and thus a thousand years later, once Discord's control is broken, there's nothing stopping them from hooking up, which they eventually do.

On the plus side Shining Armor partially ascends in chapter 7 (he's immortal but his new wings are smaller than Snowflake's) so Cadence won't experience the same tragedy as her aunt.

Currently Cadance is married to a mortal unicorn, while Luna marries Twilight, who is an alicorn and is thus long-lived like her.

</li><li> Discussed in <em>Tron: Invasion</em> (a <em>very</em> loose adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">TRON 2.0</a></em>). Jet Bradley asks Mercury (a female Program) to promise never to worship him (Programs revering humans like we revere Gods), saying that humans age and die eventually. However, a Program's typical lifespan is about five or six human years to a human male's eighty, a fact that isn't lost on Mercury.
</li><li> This is a common theme in fanworks (such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIDw7HoQXJE">this fan-vid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheNamelessDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheNamelessDoll">TheNamelessDoll</a>) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverShip">ship</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesFriendship">friend-ship</a>) Ariel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a>. Ariel may be a mermaid but she is still <em>mortal</em>. Peter on the other hand is perpetually a child. It's frequent that Ariel has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on Peter only for him to gain one towards Ariel as she ages into a teenager and then eventually an adult.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Offspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Offspring">Offspring</a></em>, Link is a Hylian while his wife Mipha is a Zora. They're both physically and socially teenagers, except that Mipha is over a century old. Link never put much thought into the lifespan differences between himself and Mipha until after their children were hatched. Link realized that when he died of old age, his children would only be at the end of their adolescence, but he doesn't mind because Mipha would still be around for them. In a twist of fate, this is subverted as <em>Mipha</em> is the one that dies when their kids are just a few months old. Link is put into a coma and wakes up a century later to find his triplets the same physical age as him.
</li><li> There is a lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> fanfiction that deals with this concept, since only the manga says normal humans become long-lived in the future and even if they do live a long time, they still don't live as long as the senshi. One large series by author Bill K. even features two marriages within the senshi to normal men who, obviously, die way sooner than their senshi wives. Jupiter and Mercury react accordingly... and then hook up, so there's that.
</li><li> A lot of the more...mature fanfic written for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> touches on Sarek and Amanda's relationship and how Sarek would handle Amanda's death.
<ul><li> There are a couple of not exactly canon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novels that touch on them as well. <em>The Vulcan Academy Murders</em> is basically all about their relationship, and human/Vulcan relationships in general. It uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> to age Amanda back down and give them another thirty years or so.
</li><li> Other EU materials tend to follow this trope to its harsher conclusion probably because Star Trek The Next Generation confirmed that Sarek outlived Amanda. One Star Trek comic has Spock and Sarek converse about Amanda's increasing age and her growing health issues. Sarek states that while he was always aware of the fact that he would outlive Amanda, she has had such an impact upon his life that he finds the idea of spending the better part of a century alone to be unnerving.

One fanfic example is <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10034019/1/Prisoner-of-Time">Prisoner Of Time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> Touched on in the animated video for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> remix <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnUdsjat_tA">"Alice -&gt; Dere"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a> Alice and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">human</a> Marisa.
</li><li> Indeed, this trope seems to be the general source of angst in Alice x Marisa pairings (the famous "Marisa Stole the Precious Thing" remix by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IOSYS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IOSYS">IOSYS</a>, who did the one above as well, contains the line "You and I are of a different kind"). Which is all good and well, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in and you realize that, under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">current canon</a>, Alice USED to be human but became youkai via magical research, and Marisa has access to Alice's notes/materials/Alice herself, AND Marisa has been independently searching for an immortality potion.
</li><li> The topic is likely to come up in any of the human/youkai pairings, as well as any immortal/youkai or immortal/human pairings, such as Keine x Mokou, since the immortals are <em>completely</em> immortal and can't even choose to follow their loves to the grave.
</li><li> By far the most common is Sakuya, even without involving romance, as she is the only human in the relatively large Koumakan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd">Cast Herd</a>, meaning her expected lifespan is considerably less than their's. However, there is also speculation that Sakuya is a Lunarian, who are incredibly long-lived (Eirin and the Watatsuki sisters are at least several millenia old). Also occasionally inverted due to Sakuya's time-stopping powers.
</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> remix that uses this heavily (in a very beautiful waltz) is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bgJ8o3tx74">"The song of a Broken Youkai who loved a human."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> I wonder what it could possibly be about...

Main character John Oldman appears to be 35, but is actually a Cro-Magnon caveman who has lived through 14 000 years.

</li><li> In the movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TuckEverlasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TuckEverlasting">Tuck Everlasting</a></em>, this is the reason for Miles Tuck's bitterness; his wife, daughter, and son all died while he stayed immortal.

Later in the movie we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlotte visiting her daughter in the hospital.

<ul><li> These happen several times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s Middle-earth legendarium, in the form of rare but significant elf-human pairings. Elf-human mixed couples overall are very rare (known are five and a half, and only three got together permanently). The main angst isn't just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">elves live forever</a> and humans don't — the two races do not share the same afterlife. Elves, even if killed, travel to the Undying Lands in the west and are usually granted resurrection, eventually. Humans, upon death, disappear from the world and their fate is unknown (presumably they go to the Christian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>). And elves by nature mate for life, so they usually can't get over it and marry one of their own kind afterwards.
<ul><li> In some cases the angelic Powers give the immortal one of a pair the choice to become mortal, which means they can spend eternity separated forever from their entire family, rather than from their spouse. And the children of most elf-human pairings were historically given the same choice, which potentially separated them from <em>their</em> families, also. Like all resolutions in Tolkien's works, either choice is bittersweet at best.
</li><li> One of the better-known cases is the romance between the mortal Aragorn and the immortal maiden Arwen Undómiel, daughter of Elrond, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. It was a relatively minor subplot in the novel (their full story is in the LotR's Appendices), but became a much larger part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">the later films</a>. During the book Aragorn is 88 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">young for a human of Númenórean ancestry</a>), while she is 2798 years old. And when they first fell in love, he was a <em>teenager</em> and she was still over 2700 years old.
<ul><li> To be specific, Arwen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinzHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinzHybrid">descended from a line of mixed heritage</a> involving humans, elves, and even a Maia (angel). Her paternal grandparents, themselves half-human, chose to be immortal, and the opportunity to choose was passed on to their descendants. Aragorn himself is distantly descended from the same ancestors. The first King of Númenor was Elros... Elrond's brother! There were dozens and dozens of generations in between, which is itself another example of this very trope. Apparently if the parents decide to be immortal, their children can still pick, but if they decide to be human, they can't... this has some connection to Tolkien's Christian concept of death as the "Gift of Men," since presumably it involves actually going to Heaven. Aragorn, having Númenórean ancestry, lives roughly 210 years. But Arwen may have outlived him by months or years — at the end he was aging and decided when to die of free will (an ability only Númenóreans get), while Arwen was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">still young</a> and not ready to go. Arwen left her daughters and son behind to go to Lothlórien and spent her remaining time alone.

Some specific examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExpectingSomeoneTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExpectingSomeoneTaller">Expecting Someone Taller</a></em>, most of Malcolm's romantic entanglements after receiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRingOfTheNibelung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRingOfTheNibelung">the Ring</a> fall into this category, especially his eventual engagement to the Valkyrie Ortlinde.
</li><li> <em>Nothing But Blue Skies</em> has an ancient Eastern Dragon take human shape because she's fallen in love with a human—although he's completely unaware, and she's too shy to tell him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DjinnRummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DjinnRummy">Djinn Rummy</a></em>, an immortal genie falls in love with his human female master, although it's because of a love potion.

However, her life is very brief compared to his (a few hours, at most, with the island's weather), but she also always produces a seed that is a fresh new version of herself. So he spends his whole life clambering over the island all day, looking for her newest sprouting, even though she won't remember him, so that for however brief, they can be together.

While they are about the same age (Marcie is initially slightly annoyed that the first dragon she meets isn't some ancient bastion of knowledge but is actually slightly younger than her), he can easily reach a thousand years and has no theoretical limit to his lifespan, while she shouldn't expect to live longer than a hundred. Both dragons and humans remind them of this several times over the course of the story, advising them to break it off, but they refuse.

<ul><li> Honor herself, and everyone else in Manticore, has ready access to Prolong, a treatment that pushes human longevity up to several centuries...if it's administered at a young enough age. The people of Grayson, the planet which adopts Honor as its own, only get it in the present, and many of the people she gets close to are too old for the procedure and thus she'll outlive them by a considerable margin.
</li><li> One particularly tragic case did involve romance: Bernadus van Dort and Suzanne Bannister. He was a prolong recipient, and she turned out to be too old for the treatment. What made it worse was that she didn't die at a ripe old age, with her husband still looking young. Her transport ship vanished, probably thanks to a pirate attack. Oh, and their daughters were aboard as well. The whole thing also created a rift between van Dort and Suzanne's brother Trevor, and Trevor's friend Steve Westman, which spills over into the plot of <em>Shadow of Saganami</em>.
</li><li> Historically, this was also the fate of Treecats, as they have lifespans of 250+ years. Prior to prolong, a treecat who bonded with a human almost always committed suicide after their adopt human died. Only rebonding to another human makes it possible to avoid this suicide.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are two main elf-human pairings: Beren (human) and Lúthien (half-elf, half-angel); and Tuor (human) and Idril (elf). Lúthien chose to become mortal; Tuor supposedly became immortal, and lives on as the sole human inhabitant of Valinor. These four were in turn the ancestors of Elrond and Elros, and thus of Arwen and Aragorn. Beren and Lúthien's son Dior may have had a Mayfly December Romance with his elven wife Nimloth — he was killed young, but he grew up at the rate mortals do and it isn't clear how long he was going to live, or if he would have been given a choice to be immortal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">Their fates after death are unknown.</a>
</li><li> There is one male elf/female human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star Crossed couple</a> — in fact the very first elf-human romance known to us: Aegnor (Galadriel's brother) and Andreth (a woman of the Edain). Aegnor pretended not to return her love, so he wouldn't have to watch her age, though it probably broke his heart to do so. He also feared that if the Siege of Angband broke then he would very likely die in battle (and he was right — she outlived him). Since elves reincarnate, Aegnor refused to be reembodied since a world without Andreth was not one he wanted to ever return to.
</li><li> Another human-elf pairing that didn't work out was that between Imrazôr, a Númenórean who settled at Dol Amroth, and Mithrellas, a Wood Elf who got totally lost in the mountains when her people fled from the Necromancer in south Mirkwood. He and his folk sheltered her and they got married, but after having two half-elven kids she just...got up and left him. Elves aren't inclined to marry people they don't love, and there's no suggestion that he married her against her will, so maybe she just didn't want to watch Imrazôr and the children die of old age.
</li><li> Faramir and Éowyn probably experienced this trope, since he had some Númenórean blood (and some elven blood from Mithrellas), and despite being 12 years older than her, he could have outlived her by several decades. We aren't given a date of death for Éowyn, but Faramir lived well into his second century and it's extremely unlikely Éowyn lived nearly that long - or is it? Eowyn's grandmother was Dunedain <em>and</em> descended from the Princes of Dol Amroth. It is not impossible that Eowyn inherited her longevity. Note that <em>all</em> of the mixed couples in Middle-earth human/elf, despite the fact that both hobbits and dwarves are usually on good terms with their immediate human neighbors and with one another. Dwarves are an unrelated species and can't breed with non-dwarves, but hobbits are just small humans. And in the First and Second Ages when they were on good terms with other humans, the Drúedain apparently didn't marry outside their own people either.
</li><li> Applied tragically with the Kings of Gondor. Valacar, the grandnephew of the King of Gondor at the time, visited Rhovanion and wed Vidumavi. Vidumavi was a princess of the Northmen of Rhovanion, and at the time of her marriage was much younger than Valacar. Vidumavi lived a very long time for one of her own people, but because she had no Númenórean blood, she grew old at a much faster rate than Valacar - she died before he ascended the throne. The Men of Gondor feared that their son Eldacar would not live as long, and this instigates a civil war in Gondor. (Eldacar inherits Valacar's longevity and lives to be 235 - only three years less than his father. He also inherits the fearless spirit of his mother's people.)

Taking place not long after <em>First Contact</em>, the plotline includes Data's emotional realization of what he's always known intellectually — he will almost certainly outlive all of his friends on the <em>Enterprise</em>. And then another set, and another.

Ariel is effectively immortal, and has been alive longer than humans have existed as a species. Her relationship with Picard was genuine while she had amnesia; when her memory returned, though, she began stringing the "innocent child" along as part of her master plan. Being as old as she is, she's an complete expert at manipulation, plus her people are naturally designed for it anyway.
</li><li> Several times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SymphonyOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SymphonyOfAges">Symphony of Ages</a></em>. The Cymrians live shorter lives with each generation, starting with immortality at generation one. This presumably causes true mayfly romances, but the most visible case is Tristan Steward and his consort Prudence. While they grew up at about the same rate, she starts showing her age and he remains youthful. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A much more complicated version arises among Rhapsody, Ashe, and Achmed. Rhapsody, a first-generation Cymrian and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">lirin</a>, will live forever. So will Achmed. Ashe, however, is part dragon and a third generation Cymrian, granting him a lifetime that will probably last a few thousand years more before he either dies or reincarnates as a full dragon (somehow presumed to end their romance, although other dragons have loved humans before). Achmed loves Rhapsody, or at least believes she is the only possible suitable mate for him, but is content to wait millennia for Ashe's eventual removal. (Somewhat surprising, given that he is a cold-hearted assassin and probably quite capable of killing Ashe if he felt his need for Rhapsody required it.)</span>

When one falls in love with a human this trope is brought up; in fifty years the human will be in her dotage or dead, and plenty of Kantri spend that long meditating or in contemplation; fifty years is also about how long it takes for a Kantri to heal from a major wound, which they do while in a comatose state. Oddly, the fact that they have ready access to a kind of elixir of youth is never mentioned by either party. When the Kantri seems to be dying, the human thinks that he should have mourned over her grave for a thousand years. Instead, though, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">becomes human</a>, though he still has Kantri blood; later on her blood is changed to be like his, so if <em>that</em> conveys longevity neither is too likely to outlive the other.

This results in elderly husbands having wives in their mid-thirties at most. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonist (from Earth) believes this to be misogynistic and turns off the stasis field in his house. This gets his relationship with his Tranai wife destroyed, since, as she points out, the still young women have decades of their own life ahead of them after their husbands die, and she is deeply unhappy getting older (gasp!) every day, all day long. The concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowOldWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowOldWithMe">Grow Old with Me</a> is (literally) alien to Tranai</span>.
</li><li> This trope is touched upon in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em>, which has as a main character an essentially immortal man, Lazarus Long (born Woodrow Wilson Smith, around the turn of the 20th century). Specifically, the story involving Dora. She's fully aware of the trope in play, and insists on playing it straight. Lazarus offers to move with her to a planet with rejuvenation facilities and extend her life as long as possible. She refuses, saying she wants to spend the life she was naturally given on her home world with the man she loves. Lazarus specifically states that it's a bad idea for long-lived Howards such as himself to marry people with normal lifespans (or "ephemerals"). Dora was possibly the only time he broke that rule.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TuckEverlasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TuckEverlasting">Tuck Everlasting</a></em>, not-actually-17-year-old Jesse Tuck tells Winny to drink magic water to gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">Immortality</a> when she reaches that age. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She gives the water to a toad, ages normally, lives a happy life and dies.</span> Jesse's older brother Miles was once married.

<ul><li> Bella is very conscious of this trope and has spent most of the first three books trying to convince her immortal vampire boyfriend, Edward (who is more than a century old stuck in the body of a teenager), to bite her to avoid this. In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, she does end up turned into a vampire after her pregnancy makes her very sick and the delivery destroys her body.
</li><li> This is also the fate of werewolf-human couples, because werewolves do not age while they are phasing. The only solution for them to live equally with their partner is for them to stop phasing altogether.

She was about ready to give up on relationships when she fell in love with another long-lived ex-hero, the former Tin Man (Langley Paulson, currently head of the Engineering Department).
<ul><li> The topic has mostly been avoided by the students who are in similar circumstances; while some of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a> (including some who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">avatars of gods or god-like beings</a>, have powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factors</a> that stop them from aging, or are simply temporally frozen), well, being teenagers, most of them haven't really come to grips with this yet. The ones who seem to have given it the most thought are Tennyo (who is bonded with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">humanoid WMD</a> created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">the Isokist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">before the Solar System formed</a>) and Carmilla (an infant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>), and neither of them are happy with the thought that anyone whom they might be involved with would likely be dead and dust in what to them would be a blink of an eye.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnfinishedTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnfinishedTales">The Unfinished Tales</a></em>, this trope played beautifully in the marriage of Aldarion and Erendis on Númenor, lost home of the Dúnedain. Númenóreans had a typical lifespan of 100 to 200 years, but those of the royal house lived two to three times as long. Aldarion was the 6th king of Númenor; Erendis his wife was not from the royal house. She was also much younger than him, but still most likely to die first. Aldarion's long lifespan and his tendency to make multi-year voyages while Erendis continued to age (relatively) rapidly drove a massive, nasty wedge in their relationship. Their problems in turn embittered their daughter, the future queen Tar-Ancalimë. This proved to be the first small step in the eventual downfall of Númenor.
<ul><li> Erendis dies in Second Age 985, over a century before Aldarion dies. Aldarion lived to be 398; Erendis died at only 214. She did drown herself, but she was already very old for a non-royal Númenórean. Ancalimë inherits her father's longevity and actually lives even longer than him - she dies at the age of 412.
</li></ul></li><li> Nicholas Sparks's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember">A Walk to Remember</a></em> features a young man who marries his high school sweetheart when she's dying of cancer, leaving her dead at the age of nineteen mere months after their wedding while he lives a normal lifespan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods">The War Gods</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>, this can result frequently. In particular half-elves typically marry other half-elves or full elves because otherwise this trope will result, and also the children won't inherit the elven long lifespan. (A human and an elf, two half elves, or a elf and a half elf makes a half elf with a 400 year life span, while the oldest elves date to the cleft point 8,000 years ago from which all elves originate). This is also a serious issue with Wild Wizards, who have lifespans well over a thousand years, although its rare for multiple wild wizards to exist at the same time. All the other races of man (all of whom live longer than humans) can also breed with mainline humans, with the lifespan of their issue being all over the place.
</li><li> Discussed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> book <em>Squirrelflight's Hope</em>. Squirrelflight's mate has become a Clan leader, meaning that he was gifted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHaveNineLives">nine lives</a>. She thinks about how this means that he'll likely long outlive her, and frets that he can always take another mate after she's gone, and wonders if the reason he's not ready to have more kits right now is because he has so much more time than her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, this trope is why Aes Sedai rarely marry: they know that they will far outlive their husbands, and probably their children.
<ul><li> And grandchildren. And great-grandchildren too. The will most likely die around the same time as their great-great-granchildren. The average age expectancy for a channeler who has sworn on the oath rod is somewhere between 2 and 3 centuries. For one who hasn't its somewhere around 6.
</li><li> And strangely, those Aes Sedai who do end up in romances tend to be young for their profession and fall in love with men who are getting on in years. Examples include Nynaeve and Lan, Moiraine and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thom</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Siuan and Gareth Bryne</span>. In all of these cases, the man is older than the woman anyway, but she can expect to live another two centuries at least.
</li></ul></li><li> In Octavia Butler's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Patternist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Patternist">Wild Seed</a></em>, protagonist Anywanyu had many husbands throughout her unnaturally long life, both she and her lovers seemed at terms with this.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> novels are full of this : X(A/N)th (male demon)/Chlorine, Demetria (female demon)/Veleno, Jewel (nymph) / Crombie, and others. Averted, as Xanth is also absolutely full of Fountains of Youth. And X(A/N)th, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">literally omnipotent</a> can do anything he damn well pleases, including extending a human's life indefinitely.

The one exception is Olaf, who is the god of rebirth and thus will stay young forever and cannot die of natural causes. The current generation of Johnsons are actually his grandchildren and he pretends that he is their wayward cousin. By his count he fathered 20 children so far and had to abandon them and their mothers when it became too apparent that he did not age. These days he no longer tries to have a long-lasting romantic relationship.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em>, two out of the three women on the main cast were an avatar of a star (it only became apparent rather late in the series, but she was believed to be older and immortal much earlier), and a just about immortal android.

</li><li> An early first season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em> focused specifically on the issue, with Samantha (apparently) admitting she will still appear to be in her twenties when Darrin is in his seventies. The dilemma is solved when Samantha uses her magic to age along with Darrin. It is unclear whether this would include her actually dying with Darrin instead of living centuries after his death, but for her to shorten her lifespan so radically to age as Darrin ages would provide yet one more reason for Endora's continual efforts to turn Samantha against Darrin. (Given the fact the series ran for eight seasons, it was actually possible to see Samantha make good on her promise as the actress aged into her late 30s as the series progressed.)

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> Buffy's relationship with Angel was a mortal/immortal case. This didn't bother them much, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and then Buffy's mom brought it up just in time for the season finale. Angel ended up leaving Buffy for her own good... and the age issue in human/vampire relationships was apparently forgotten by all concerned at that point. (Although the problem certainly didn't figure in either Buffy/Spike or Angel/Cordelia.) Of course, the only reason they came up for that reason of Angel leaving Buffy was because they had to somehow get him out of Sunnydale for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">his spinoff show</a>. Also, this was only part of the reason Angel left Buffy, the other, of course, being that she was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause">Curse Escape Clause</a>.
</li><li> It's fairly clear Buffy never intended anything other than a sexual relationship with Spike, and highly doubtful Spike would have thought of the issue at all. And Angel, by the time he started getting tentatively involved with Cordelia, was planning to become human again anyway.
<ul><li> Also it <em>does</em> come up for Buffy/Spike in the comics, when they are actually dating rather than just sleeping together. Spike tries to break it off partially because of this issue until Buffy tells him off for it and they decide to stay together.
</li></ul></li><li> The initial age problem was enhanced by Buffy being a high school teen; Buffy/Spike and Angel/Cordelia had slightly more adult girls. Buffy provides another variant: given probable Slayer life expectancy (a few years, cut short by violence) even an ordinary human romance could be Mayfly December, at least on average. Also, given the fact that Angel was fighting side-by-side with Buffy, his survival chances weren't much higher. It would have been entirely plausible for him to die in battle, leaving Buffy alive.
</li><li> It should also be noted that by the time Angel starts getting involved with Cordelia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's part demon, and a damn powerful one at that. So, it's a high probability that she was as immortal as he was at that point</span>. It should be noted that the life expectancy of each character, in terms of their relationship, was rarely brought up. Angel's stated reason for leaving Buffy was that his curse (making him unable to ever be truly happy with her, which obviously would put a strain on both of them) and his nature as a vampire (sterile and lethal reaction to sunlight basically rules out any kind of normal family situation) made him unable to give her the life she deserved.
</li><li> Played with for Anya/Xander. They never had a Mayfly December Romance relationship, but only because Anya lost her immortality for the duration of their relationship, and got it back after they broke up. Notable in that she lost her immortality in an unrelated fight with Giles, and got it back only because she was so furious about the break up.
</li><li> On the villainous side the Mayor seems to have genuinely loved his wife, staying with her as she grew old and died while he remained young.
</li></ul></li><li> Could have happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> between Piper and Leo, given that witches have normal human lifespans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">whitelighters</a> are immortal, if Leo didn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> choose to become human</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: The Doctor tends to avoid becoming too close to his companions because of this, due to what he calls "the curse of the Time Lords"  a companion could spend their whole life with him, but he couldn't spend his whole life with them (see quote), being "immortal, barring accidents".
<ul><li> The Third Doctor's relationship with Jo Grant had shades of this. Their relationship was never quite romantic, but he did seem awfully disappointed when she ran off and married a man she described as a younger version of him.
<ul><li> Worse still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSarahJaneAdventuresS4E5E6DeathOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSarahJaneAdventuresS4E5E6DeathOfTheDoctor">according to Jo</a>, she never stopped running, hoping she'd see the Doctor again someday.

<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> I don't age. I regenerate. But humans decay. You wither and you die.

I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.
</div></li><li> Played straight in the Doctor's relationship with Rose Tyler, which did become romantic and had a bittersweet ending.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E5FleshAndStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E5FleshAndStone">"Flesh and Stone"</a>, when the Doctor raises this trope as a defence to Amy's romantic overtures: "Aw, you are sweet, Doctor, but I really wasn't suggesting anything quite so long term."
</li><li> Played with/zig-zagged and turned on its head in various ways the case of his much later relationship with Clara, another human.
<ul><li> The usual expectation is turned on its head when they get separated for what, due to the time travel involved, were several centuries for him but barely more than half an hour for her, leading to a scenario where she very nearly sees <em>him</em> kick the bucket from old age.
</li><li> While she shames the rest of his people into granting him an additional regeneration cycle, effectively procuring him a second chance at life, the experience of seeing generations of humans live and die before his eyes in all those centuries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe">leads him to break it off</a>, leading to a prolonged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip">Anchored Ship</a> situation.
</li><li> All of this comes with the interesting side effect that he, previously youthful-looking and likely to have stayed that way for most of her life if not for said separation, wound up with the appearance of a man in his fifties, while Clara is still 27, reversing the situation one would expect to set in eventually.
</li><li> Further played with to poignant effect in a later, where they were both under the impression that they had just reunited after 62 years apart, in which she never accepted anyone else's marriage proposals (and explicitly states that he <em>would</em> have been a worthy husband). Ironically, when actually forced to confront his fear of seeing her as a wizened old lady, he barely even perceived her aged appearance and was much more upset about the fact that they didn't spend these years together. Once they figure out that they are still in a dream state and free themselves from it, they take that lesson to heart, and leave hand in hand, intending to make the most of their limited time together.
</li><li> Their story has an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>. Clara eventually dies by performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice">Stupid Sacrifice</a> (both terms apply) and the Doctor does <em>everything</em> he can to bring her back, including taking over his home planet by banishing the old president, (who, in fairness, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a>,) shooting an innocent man (who could fortunately regenerate) in cold blood, and almost creating a time paradox. In the end, he succeeds, and her resurrection has the bonus of making her immortal, but still able to die whenever she choosing, meaning that they could spend the rest of their lives together without either of them having to end up alone (and with the aging problem no longer an issue for her; plus, it's implied she's now indestructible too). The previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip">Anchored Ship</a> is officially un-anchored briefly as Clara invites the Doctor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elopement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elopement">just fly away</a> with her. However, they realise that they make each other willing to commit too extreme actions and the Doctor is forced to erase his own memories of Clara. But they both have long lives ahead of them and are both able to continue travelling through time and space in their own time machines, which neither of them thought they would ever be able to do again.

The most prominent is Abigail, who he married in the 1940s. She knew his secret the entire time and was committed to him, but over time, she got older while he continued to look 35. By 1985, the strain of this difference and the way onlookers gaped at them became too much for her, and she left.

"The Green-Eyed Monster" shows Cupid falling for Psyche, which Aphrodite disapproves of. Part of that is because she's jealous of Psyche's beauty, but it's also because of this trope. Aphrodite notes she's had experience in this area and that mortals are like plums: they taste great for a while but eventually become prunes. Cupid's situation is resolved by Hercules suggesting Aphrodite give Psyche ambrosia.

It's spotlighted in the season one episode "Studies in Light", in which Duncan encounters a mortal woman who was his lover fifty years ago.
<ul><li> In another episode, Methos, the oldest immortal alive, strikes up a relationship with a woman who is not only a muggle, but is dying of an incurable disease. When this is brought up, he invokes the trope.
<div class="indent"><strong>Methos:</strong> I know she's dying, okay? You are all dying. Twenty years. Six months. What's the difference?
</div></li></ul></li><li> The hero and protagonist Naoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KidouKeijiJiban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KidouKeijiJiban">Kidou Keiji Jiban</a></em> have this with a woman who's actually one of Biolon's rejected experiments. Firstly because the girl was basically made of raw <em>kindness</em>, which Biolon, being an evil empire, can't tolerate; secondly because she have the power to purify monsters. Naoto, as Jiban, saved her, gave her the name "Pearl" and they quickly reaches the romance territory, before learn she's dying. Pearl sacrifies her last forces to save Jiban from Biolon's latest monster, leaving Naoto heartbroken.
<ul><li> Naoto himself is this to his partner and veteran at the police department, Yoko. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">a revived-turned-into-a-cyborg detective/Robocop expy</a>, and some sort of secret agent to the secret police's top dogs, Naoto/Jiban could outlive or even live less than her. With Yoko in love with Jiban and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">totally unable</a> to see through Naoto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a> until <em>the very last episode</em>, after Biolon's defeat, Naoto chooses to travel around the world, to learn and live as much as his lifespan as a cyborg ables him.
</li></ul></li><li> Their potential difference in lifespan has been a source of angst to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and Lois Lane in various incarnations. In particular, an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> focused on it, with Clark admitting he had no idea how fast he would age — if he aged at all. It was possibly resolved when Superman gave up some of his youth to rescue Jimmy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aging</a> and also to de-age the villain of the day into a baby, and one of the characters suggested that Superman had given up enough of his youth for it to no longer be an issue. Of course, since the show didn't <em>run</em> that long, we have no idea if Lois still has to worry about this...
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewAmsterdam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewAmsterdam">New Amsterdam</a></em>, where the premise is that the main character will be immortal <em>until</em> he finds and weds his true love. Only partly averted, because any relationship with someone <em>other</em> than his true love would fall into this trope, including platonic relationships such as his <em>67</em> children. He has mentioned being careful to avoid siring more children specifically because of not wanting to watch them grow old and die before him.
</li><li> The Beauty and the Beast type relationship between Rumpelstiltskin and Belle on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>.

<ul><li> Due to the great difference between Vulcan and human lifespans, Spock's father was sure to outlive his mother by many years. (This wasn't addressed much in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a></em>.)

</li><li> The same issue might come up with Klingon/human relationships, as Klingons live 150 years or so. Or it might be a MFDR in the other direction, as they much prefer to die in combat while they're still young.
</li><li> Worf's more prominent (and only non-Klingon...er...Half-Klingon) marriage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">was to a joined Trill</a>, which confuses, and, depending on one's interpretation of the joined Trill/Symbiont relationship, laughs in the face of the whole matter. (None of the major Daxes have had any problem with long-term couplings with persons who aren't joined Trill.)
</li><li> Data of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, being an android, doesn't age and could theoretically live forever, so any relationship he enters into (unless it's with another artifical life form) is this, although none of the relationships depicted onscreen last long enough for this to matter.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>,</em> the changeling Laas brings up this trope while trying to convince Odo (a changeling whose species has an incredibly long lifespan) to leave Kira (a Bajoran with a roughly human-like lifespan) in order to join Laas in locating the rest of The Hundred.
<div class="indent"><strong>Laas</strong>: It won't last. <br/><strong>Odo</strong>: The fact that your relationship failed doesn't mean mine will. <br/><strong>Laas</strong>: True. If you're very lucky, you'll get to watch her grow old and die.

<div class="indent"><strong>Flint:</strong> I have married a hundred times; inhaled a brief fragrance. Then... age... death... the taste of dust.

<ul><li> For most of the first three seasons, Kes, whose race has a nine-year lifespan, was in a relationship with Neelix, whose life expectancy was apparently like humans. Kes's replacement, Seven of Nine, had her own age issue — she was only six when the Borg assimilated her, making relationships with the adult crew somewhat dubious. The exception was the Doctor, who was technically only a few years old himself. Thus Doc/Seven (teased, but never followed through on) was a rare example of a Mayfly December Romance that <em>looked</em> ickier than it was.
</li><li> Explored also in the episode where Kes is traveling backwards in time, so we see an alternate future where Kes is married to Tom Paris while his friend Harry Kim is married to Kes's daughter.
</li><li> The Doctor gets another in the final episode that has scenes set in the future, he married a human woman, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then that future was changed when Janeway went into the past to get the ship home sooner</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> episode "Exile" features an alien who has already loved his way through a few mayflies, and he wants Hoshi to be the next one.

Although Jack's home era is far into the future (the 51st century), has been living through the eras after inexplicably finding himself in the 1940s. He's been alive ever since. Ianto is mortal, and, while Jack can (and often does) die, he will always regenerate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes tragic when Ianto dies.</span>
<ul><li> According to a photograph seen briefly at the end of "Something Borrowed" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack has had at least one spouse he has outlived.</span>
</li><li> In "Small Worlds", we see Estelle, an old woman who tells Gwen about how she was in love with Jack's father decades before; turns out it was Jack, and the affection is still obviously there on his end despite his being, physically, several decades younger. His reaction to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her death</span> at the end of the episode was heartbreaking.
</li><li> <em>Children of Earth</em>: "Day One" introduces us to Alice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack's daughter who looks about the same age as him as she hasn't inherited his immortality.</span>

I'm nothing more than a blip in time for you, Jack. Everyday, I grow a little older. But you're immortal. You've already lived a thousand lifetimes. How could you watch me grow old and die? How can I watch you live and never age a day?</span>
</div></li><li> Also addressed in a conversation in <em>Children of Earth</em>, Day Three. And then, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ianto dies</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a></em>, a man who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">appears to be in his thirties or forties</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">revealed to be thousands of years old</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He leaves his wife to prevent her from discovering his secret, but she tracks him down anyway when she is old and he is still young.</span>
</li><li> Stefan and Elena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em> are another example of an immortal/mortal case. Stefan is a 164 year old vampire and Elena is a 17 year old human girl, who will grow old and eventually die. Stefan is immortal, will never age, cannot grow old and is immune to all human illnesses. Therefore, Stefan's survival rates are significantly much higher then Elena's, who is a vulnerable human. Elena is susceptible to human weaknesses such as illness, aging and possible death. However, despite the difference in species and age difference, Stefan and Elena don't seem to mind. Their love for each other seems to transcend all barriers. Although, due to the differences in age and species, there has been some tension between Stefan and Elena. Stefan and Elena have talked about their age difference and also, the possibility of Elena choosing immortality in order to spend an eternity with Stefan. However, Elena has told Stefan that even though she loves him, she doesn't and never wants to be a vampire and would rather stay human, grow old, have children and live a normal human life. However, the age difference and the concerns over Elena's safety and vulnerabilities as a human don't seem to be a problem any longer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> now that Elena has recently become a vampire.</span>
<ul><li> Same goes for Damon and Elena, again with these particular problems disappearing once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elena is turned</span>.
</li><li> Jeremy and Anna were well on their way to this trope too.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>, Justin and Juliet. She may have been joking when she talked about Caesar but she's been to well over five hundred proms.
<ul><li> When she talks about her relationship with Mason during the finale of that arc, she says she loved him a 'long time ago' - 'Like, before America was discovered'. Which would mean that this trope applies to Alex and Mason's romance too.
<ul><li> Actually several Wizards are shown in the series who are several hundred years old, and one confirmed case of making to several thousand. While its never confirmed that this applies to all Wizards, its certainly possible so this might not be an issue.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger</a></em> had immortal Deboss villainess Candelira <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">fall for</a> Nossan.

<ul><li> The film "May Flowers" made with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMovies">The Movies</a></em> features a romance between a normal human man and a woman (the title character) who is an ancient species, timeless but not ageless. Over the course of a year she ages an entire lifetime and dies at midnight every New Year's Eve only to be reborn as a baby seconds later. May finds husbands to take care of her during this time but does not stay married to them for more than 50 years.

</li><li> Sonata Arctica's song 'Under Your Tree' describes this kind of friendship. Originally it was written because Tony Kakko's (main vocalist) dog, which he raised since it was a pup, died, and the day he was born he planted a tree. Now, many years later, the only thing that was left is the tree and the memories.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. While half-elves tend to have somewhat downbeat childhoods, their parents can apparently have quite happy lives together. The human is attracted to the elf's grace, the elf to the human's energy. It's implied that the human gets a partner who doesn't age for the duration of their relationship, and the elf gets a satisfying if short-lived (for an elf) tryst without any worries about bad breakups (assuming their human partner dies of old age). Other half-races, though, either play it straight, tending to come about because of Mayfly December Romances (half-dragons—even an elf will be in their grave for millennia by the time a dragon lover dies), or in the few exceptions avert it entirely. In the case of half-orcs, it's reversed, since orcs have far shorter lifespans than humans, and are more likely to die by violence.
</li><li> Much like with Vampire above, the titular characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> are prone to this, at least when they fall in love with mortals. Exalted are possessed of extremely long lifespans and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that can handle pretty much anything sort of regenerating limbs. For the average mortal, dying well before middle age of cholera or dysentery is a very real possibility, and even those who do see the ends of their natural lifespans (say, due to having an Exalted friend who can literally banish mundane disease with a touch) is only going to live to about 80. By contrast, Solar Exalted (the "default" playable Exalted type from the core book) die of old age generally anywhere between 2500-3000 years old. Regularly outliving all your mortal friends and associates (who are also now <em>much, much more fragile than you</em> results in a similar sort of alienation from normal human experience as the kind Vampires experience. Even the shortest-lived Exalted, the Dragon-Blooded, can live anywhere from 300-500 years (although the fact that their Exaltations are inherited means they tend to marry other Dragon-Blooded, extramarital affairs with mortal paramours are very common as long as they're careful to ensure that it doesn't result in pregnancy). Sidereal Exalted are among the most likely to get involved with mortals (under various false identities), but they're also in the fairly unique position of being much more likely than any other type of Exalted to approach this from the other direction. They live and work in Yu-Shan among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">literally-immortal</a> gods. The Sidereal Exalted have the longest natural lifespan of all the Exalted at 5000 years (around twice as much as that of Solar and Lunar Exalted), but one of their patrons is the Maiden of Endings, who ensures that there are absolutely no loopholes around that hard limit. Even if they were to achieve immortality by other means (which is fairly common among Solars and Lunars who think far enough ahead), Fate itself will conspire to see that their lives come to an end when they should. Gods, meanwhile live literally forever, and most of them consider the entire time between the end of the Primordial War/Divine Revolution and the Present Day (itself roughly an entire Sidereal lifespan) as a short but well-deserved vacation.
</li><li> Actually actively averted in the <em>Elves of Alfheim</em> supplement for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a> campaign. Elven romantic relationships are not expected to be "for life" and it is rare that an elven couple doesn't drift apart anyway after at most a century. Elves with human spouses don't like when they die, of course, but don't see this trope as a big problem.
</li><li> This is actually a very integral part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>. Part of what causes vampires to slowly turn more and more inhuman in attitude is the fact that any human relations a vampire has will eventually die. This either slowly drives them mad from despair or they simply stop bothering with considering humans anything more than toys or lunch. Vampires who try to fight this dissolution of humanity tend to be pretty unhappy.
<ul><li> Keeping ghouls (humans with vampire blood in their system) doesn't help either. They don't age, but they tend to go insane over decades or centuries for the same reason that vampires do (although slightly faster).
</li><li> And if you try to go all the way and try to make your special someone a vampire like you...well, it's a crapshoot at best, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateYouVampireDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateYouVampireDad">I Hate You, Vampire Dad</a> is very prone to rearing its ugly head.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> has one. Specifically, the Vampire Count Vlad von Carstein and his beloved wife Isabella. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">this is Warhammer</a> there is precious little angst over this as they are both bloodthirsty monsters of the old school, even before Isabella became a vampire.
</li><li> This can also be a problem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em>, particularly if the mortal in the relationship is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedFetter">Fetter</a> - because unless the wraith can resolve the relationship before the mortal dies, the wraith will be plunged into a Harrowing, a nightmarish psychodrama, with the wraith's other Fetters, and potentially their very capacity to see the living world again, at stake.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em>, you find that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The goddess Althena averts this by <em>giving up</em> her immortality and living out the rest of her life as Luna. A straighter, and more platonic example is Nall, who <em>did</em> in fact outlive his friends, and Ruby, who has to come to grips with the fact that she will do the same.</span> Presumably this will be an issue for Lucia and Hiro as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, the prolonged lifespan of the asari has colored their relationships with most of the other species, along with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">ability to mate with anything</a>. Liara explains that asari who enter into physical and emotional relationships with members of other species do so fully aware that they will outlive their partners, and take a "long view" of the relationship.
<ul><li> The children from such a relationship are always asari. In fact, most asari are the products of such relationships, as there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">stigma</a> attached to being a "pureblood".
</li><li> Asari can live for hundreds of years, while, if the partner is human, turian, quarian, or batarian; with medical advancements a member of any of those species can reach 150, and drell can get up into their eighties. With krogan, who have a similar lifespan to asari, this is not even an issue. Salarians, meanwhile, are lucky if they reach 40 — because asari are so long-lived and avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">Immortality Begins at 20</a>, salarian parents won't even see their children reach adulthood. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">This is perfectly illustrated by a elderly 35 year old salarian and his 60 year old teenage asari stepdaughter</a> in the second game. Another asari asks what species her friend's father was, is told he was a salarian, and delicately says "Oh, so you didn't get much time with him."
</li><li> One asari mentions this as a reason she's hesitant to get it on with a krogan. Krogan have at least as long of a lifespan — there's mention of one having "millenia" of experience — as asari, making it a big commitment. With humans "you just stick it out a century, and they die". Shepard is less than amused. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The couple do get together and have a daughter between games... only for the korgan to die in combat. They got less than a year together.</span>
</li><li> In one particular mission you have to get a fish for a krogan at the Citadel. In the shop, you can hear a turian and asari talking about getting a fish, and the turian said that maybe they shouldn't get a fish because they only live for a few years. This is pretty much what happens.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Asari</strong>: Well, you have to appreciate the time that you DO have with the fish-
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Turian</strong>: Oh, this is the lifespan talk, isn't it! We're not having the lifespan talk!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Asari</strong>: We have to talk about it some time!
</div><ul><li> Another possible example is the relationship between Commander Shepard and Thane Krios. One of the first things that Thane tells Shepard is that he is dying of a terminal disease and has only months to live. The fact that Shepard/the player can choose to pursue this relationship anyway, fully aware of this, puts it in this category. In the third game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies from a combination of getting stabbed by Kai Leng and the final stages of his Kepral's Syndrome if he didn't die in the suicide mission.</span> Liara can comment on this in <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em>, comparing Shepard's relationship with Thane with a typical asari/non-asari relationship, and encouraging her to treasure whatever time they have together.
</li><li> Liara herself is an example of this. She is very young for an asari, but even so, Shepard will most likely only be around for around the same time as she has lived thus far. This is the asari equivalent of getting married at 20 and one partner dying at 40, while the other lives to be 150, or more like comparing the lifespan of a dog to a human. If Shepard chooses the Control ending, however, <em>he</em> becomes effectively <em>immortal</em>, inverting the relationship!
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Lair of the Shadow Broker</a>, she'll even mention she's only just about to turn a 109 (and typically, asari can live up to a 1000 years). Won't stop a faithful Shepard from proposing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a> ending.
</li><li> During the third game there is a fleeting mention of asari-vorcha offspring. Vorcha live <em>twenty years</em> if they're lucky and tend to be brutal and violent. If adopted and "socialized" they're much calmer and easier to get along with, and the premier institution devoted to "socializing" vorcha is asari-run, making it a distinct possibility that some of those pairings involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Partner Husbandry</a>. Their children are lactose intolerant, for some reason. If we accept that a single line from a Gilbert and Sullivan parody song was intended to be an accurate source of information.

One of the main characters is Sam, a fourteen-year-old HALF-elf, destined (unless a Deus Ex Machina intervenes) to die in her mid thirties. The reader may draw their own conclusions as to what this meant for her parents, and what it will mean for her.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: In the episode "The Suitor" it is revealed that Princess Bubblegum is much older than she appears. In fact, her suitors have been waiting in the castle to court her for a very long time. When Peppermint Butler asks the decrepit suitors how long they've been waiting in line his answers were "87 years", "120 years", and "300 years". While all of them look incredibly old, Princess Bubblegum still looks like an 18 year old. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">the suitor</a> chosen to court the princess inherited his father's place in line after he died.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries">Archie's Weird Mysteries</a></em> is an immortal mermaid who kidnaps men with red hair and imprisons them in her cave to serve as her lover. She doesn't seem to mind that they live radically shorter lives than her as she views them as more as pets than anything else, and it's even implied during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> that living as her prisoner is such a miserable experience they tend to die in months or even <em>weeks</em> purely due to despair. Thankfully Archie puts an end to all of this.
</li><li> Aang and Katara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>. The former is 112 years old (although has been frozen in an iceberg for those 100 years) and Katara is 14. This is justified, however, since Aang hasn't had any experiences beyond the years he lived out, so mentally, he isn't really older than Katara (except for the wisdom he was taught as an airbender monk). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This explains why his conscious lifespan was way shorter than Katara's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, where he is dead long before Korra's adventure even begins.</span> Then again, it was pretty obvious that something like that would happen, considering the fact that the previous Avatar in the cycle <em>must die</em> for the next Avatar to be born. However, if Aang <em>hadn't</em> had his lifespan cut short by being frozen this trope would be in full swing as Avatars are exceedingly long-lived (the oldest Avatar mentioned in canon, Kyoshi, was 230 at her death).

Odie actually <em>does</em> reciprocate her feelings as, clinginess aside, she's incredibly kind and beautiful, but he can't stay with her yet as he still has to defeat Cronus. Hearing this she lets him go, explaining that as an immortal she <em>literally</em> has all the time in the world to wait for his return.
