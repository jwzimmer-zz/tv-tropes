All bridges and waterways are mined. The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped around the island. There are no guards inside the prison, only prisoners and the worlds they have made.

</p><p>Greetings, convicts. Welcome to The Alcatraz. Around here, we like to call this place "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDontLikeTheSoundOfThatPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDontLikeTheSoundOfThatPlace">The Rock</a>". I'm sure you've heard of this place. We're on an island surrounded by boiling acid that just happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">infested with sharks</a>. There are guard towers every twenty feet and there are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> here than you've had warm meals. The only way on or off this miserable spit of land is a narrow bridge, with explosives wired to it so we can destroy it at a moment's notice. We've got a perfect record here, and we're not going to lose it. So don't think about trying to escape, you miserable swine, you're likely to end up a blackened skull. There's no hope for any of you.
</p><p>Well, except for you, Mr. Protagonist and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>.

It's almost inevitable, whether you're breaking a loved one out or just escaping yourself. No one's ever escaped from here before, so of <em>course</em> you'll be the ones to pull it off. So enjoy your time here, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum">you scum.</a> God knows you won't be here long. Now, guards!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has the Nest of Maggots, a prison where Shinigami who are deemed too dangerous to be free are imprisoned. No zanpakutos are allowed, so all personnel are required to have sufficient hand-to-hand abilities to suppress any prisoner. Most prisoners are allowed to walk freely through the main chamber, while a rare few like Kurotsuchi Mayuri can also be chained in locked cells.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo">Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</a></em>, there's Cyber City.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeadLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeadLeaves">Dead Leaves</a></em> sticks one on the Moon.
</li><li> The titular title-featured <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> is Japan's only <em>privately-owned</em> correctional facility. Setting aside for a moment how insane that premise is, the place is really damn hard to escape. First of all, anyone who's on death row isn't executed on a particular day. Rather, they're fitted with collars that slowly inject a poison that will kill them after 3 days if they don't get the antidote regularly. So, most convicts can't even think about <em>escape</em> so much as survival, and escape is still forced away by death-traps and extremely bloodthirsty guards. Things are even worse if you're found to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">Deadman</a>. If that's the case, they lock you in a <em>hidden</em> cell block that most people don't know exists, and keep you under surveillance by robots and extremely bloodthirsty guards with weapons that cancel your powers. A massive escape attempt midway through the series doesn't really have any illusions about getting any more than <em>one</em> person out. The point is to get info about the place's insanity to be seen by the government.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DecaDence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DecaDence">Deca-Dence</a></em> features the Solid Quake Corporation's "Bug" Rehabilitation Facility. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHolePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHolePrison">Hell Hole Prison</a> where escape is all but impossible as it's built in the bottom of a lake where the atmospheric pressure is so great you'll be crushed instantly without a proper vehicle. And if <em>that</em> doesn't get you, the monsters the management are actively breeding in the water certainly will.
</li><li> The research facility in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> is a maximum security prison with extreme lockdown measures to ensure that the Diclonius kept there are not able to escape. Of course, the opening scene in the anime's very first episode immediately deals with one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean</a></em> has Green Dolphin Street Prison, also known as "The Aquarium" due to being built on an island off of Florida. Its offshore location keeps prisoners from escaping without aquatic transport, and many guards patrol the place to keep prisoners in their place, including Corrections Captain Miuccia Miuller, whose stand, Jailhouse Lock, is able to prevent even other Stand Users from escaping the prison. The prison also houses the Ultra Security House Unit, where exceptionally violent prisoners are housed, being kept on one meal and one shower a day, as well as having the majority of their privileges removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> has the Vindicare Prison. A place where those who break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> law, are kept in a comatose state in liquid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars">People Jars</a> for eternity. Only known people to escape are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Mukuro</a> and his group. However, it is shown that someone on the outside can negotiate someone out through a deal.
</li><li> Although it hasn't been shown, Big Lock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em> certainly qualifies. The description itself is not all that intimidating; "A prison for Master-level martial artists." Except that in this universe, "Master-level martial artists" are people who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">run across water</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">move faster than the eye can see</a>, make fissures by punching the ground, knock out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> with only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>, <em>destroy tanks bare handed and punch holes in the hull of a battleship</em>. And Big Lock can hold these people reliably enough that the good guys feel perfectly safe sending them off to there. Yowza. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then we find out that Master-level martial artists can easily break out. The only reason they don't is because they are following their code of honor that dictates that the defeated must honor the victors' wishes. That is the real reason the good guys feel safe.</span>
</li><li> Seventh Heaven in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfBanditJing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfBanditJing">King of Bandit Jing</a></em>. Otherwise completely normal, if very heavily guarded, part of its impregnability is unintentional: One of its inmates is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who has turned a part of the prison into his private sphere of influence, where anyone who enters is at his mercy.

Death by natural causes, and death by execution. To prove that, they annually select prisoners and give them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinYourFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinYourFreedom">Win Your Freedom</a> challenge, playing the prey while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">the guards try to kill them.</a>

The "Lizards" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">practically unstoppable</a>, so even the fastest runner will tire eventually and be blown up by them.

The Octagon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a>-esque Kiba faction and the feudal Galan faction all have a component of the field's generator. Unfortunately, the field is about to break and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroy the world...</a>
</li><li> The Russian prison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> was directly patterned off of a paper model that the director bought at Alcatraz's gift shop when he visited on vacation. This particular one is in the middle of a lake in Siberia, surrounded by frozen tundra and Russian soldiers, and has kept dozens of Gundam fighters caged for years. But they'd never tried to hold anyone as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> as Domon before.
</li><li> Impel Down in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, seen above as the page picture. It probably takes the cake as <em>the</em> worst prison in fiction. The only exit is also the entrance, as it is surrounded entirely by water. Since many inmates have eaten Devil Fruits, which give people super powers but robs them of the ability to swim, this automatically places <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a> onto them. If one escapes, unless they can navigate past the battleships and water infested with whirlpools and sea monsters, water currents lead directly to one of two highly-guarded government fortresses, and even then only if they permit entry. It has six levels, each progressively worse than the last to house progressively dangerous criminals, and is filled with things just waiting to kill the unlucky prisoners, including the staff.
<ul><li> Level 1 is mostly a normal floor, though the highlight of Level 1 is the "Crimson Hell," a forest within the prison made up entirely of bladed "saber trees" and "needle grass." Prisoners are forced into it, being cut up at every turn and every step, giving the forest its trademark red color, all the while being chased by poisonous insects and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> prison guards. To add to the sadism the only way out is a pit located within the Crimson Hell, which leads to <em>Level 2</em>. This was where Buggy was kept until the mass-escape, and it wasn't so bad for him, because he simply couldn't be hurt by the hazards here due to his Devil's Fruit power; for some reason, the guards never noticed that.
</li><li> Level 2 is the "Wild Beast Hell", where the cells are kept unlocked but the halls patrolled by ravenous creatures that feed off the prisoners kept within if they don't stay in their cells. Such creatures include manticores, basilisks, and a sphinx as the boss. Dozens of prisoners are packed in somewhat small cells, so their only choices are to be killed by disease or be hunted.
</li><li> Level 3 features "Starvation Hell", a vast, dry, perpetually hot desert. The prisoners here are kept floating in-between life and death with barely any water or food. There are corpses lining some of the cells, left to turn into dust (which is probably where all the sand came from).
</li><li> Level 4, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBurningHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBurningHot">Hell of Scorching Flames</a>", is even hotter than Level 3 (in fact, it's the heat from this level that keeps the above one hot), as a gigantic "Lake of Blood" is kept boiling hot at all times, which prisoners are dropped into regularly. Other prisoners are used to keep wood on the fire at all times, where they face the risk of getting into a fight and being thrown into the "Lake".
</li><li> Level 5, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsDeathlyCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsDeathlyCold">Hell of Freezing Cold</a>", is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">polar</a> opposite of previous level, with below freezing temperatures and wolves that are so vicious, they actually preyed upon Level 2's beasts when they were initially introduced there, forcing their relocation. The prisoners kept here have given up on escape and rebellion completely, as they all stay locked in their freezing cells waiting to die.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Level 5.5: DRAG REVUE!</a>: Unknown to even the Warden and his staff, there is a hidden "Paradise" level, tunneled out by a former prisoner and connected via secret passages. Prisoners lucky enough to be invited can live in relative luxury and safety, supplied by stealing from the rest of the complex. Prior to Luffy's infiltration, it is ruled by Emporio Ivankov, who has the ability to, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">gender bend</a> people. As of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ivankov and the bulk of the prisoners he had recruited have returned to his homeland, and Straw Hats ally Bentham, better known as former Baroque Works agent Mr. 2 Bon Clay, has taken over.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The generally unknown Level 6, the "Eternal Hell". Every (non-political) prisoner within is either a Lifer or on Death Row who caused incidents so serious the World Government sought to erase them from history. Among its inmates are Shilew (mentioned below), a former arc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crocodile</span>, and the target of Luffy's intrusion into the place: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Portgas D. Ace</span>. Aside from the perpetual abandonment from the world, nothing else actually goes on here, mainly because you can't do much to such badasses.
</li><li> To make this even worse, criminals go through a ritual when they first arrive where they're bathed in boiling water, which disinfects them and renders them completely free of germs and other microorganisms. (This is called "baptizing" by the guys who are in charge, likely a sick idea of a joke.) Luffy is the only inmate known to escape this, as he was an intruder who had been poisoned and was not expected to survive longer than twenty-four hours. (Note that while the ritual is known to be agonizing, there are stories of incredibly tough inmates like Portgas D. Ace, Jimbei, and Crocodile, who were able to withstand it without even flinching.)
</li><li> There's also the people <em>running the place</em>. There is Sadi-chan, a chick with a dominatrix feel who commands the Four Demon Guards (highly powered Zoans); Saldeath, who commands the Blugori (giant mooks who hunt sea kings); Hannyabal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">The Determinator</a> Vice-Warden strong enough to brave all of the above tortures in only a loincloth; and Magellan, the Chief Warden, and one of the most powerful people in the World Government's employ. He can cover himself in poison to block direct attacks, cover a prison level in poison strong enough to melt stone, and create poisonous gas and other attacks. There was once also the swordsman Shiryu, the former Head Jailer, Magellan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> near-equal, before he himself was confined to Level 6.
</li><li> To highlight just how bad this prison is, one need only look at the two successful attempts to escape it. The only self-escapee had to <em>cut off his feet</em> and use his rare power of flight to escape. Luffy's break-<em>in</em> and escape with 241 other prisoners was only possible because of the assistance and chaos of the entire populations of Levels 5, 5.5, and 6, Buggy, Mr. 3, and the timely intervention of the Blackbeard Pirates, one of the strongest crews in the world.
</li></ul></li><li> There was once an inescapable prison planet with high gravity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>. Naturally, it was only inescapable until Gene got involved. The fact that nobody had ever escaped is helped by the fact that the gravity has disastrous effects on the prisoners' health; nobody's ever served out their sentence because they all get heart attacks eventually.
</li><li> Mega Unit, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> is said to be one of these. Unfortunately, it's never mentioned until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Lucia makes his entrance by breaking through its several yard thick solid steel walls with his bare hands and slaughtering all the guards, which gives it more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a> feel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sky Prison, the Undersea Prison and, the biggest, Honey Prison. Only Honey Prison has been shown in detail. Do not let the name fool you, Honey Prison is a nightmare, very reminiscent of the aforementioned Impel Down. Among other things, the prison lies above a forest of vicious monsters that will destroy anything that moves, "Execution Beasts" guard the inside, all of whom are controlled by the warden, and prisoners are served food with their favorite parts of them removed (See below - Note that Toriko is a series about food and gourmet hunters). That's the first level. The other levels get progressively worse, with the final few levels being execution zones.
</li><li> The First Level is the Appetizer course. As described, the Appetizer course is all about having the parts of one's favorite foods taken from them. Not too bad, right? <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">WRONG</a></strong>. The "punishment" isn't just limited to the way the food is prepared; the prisoners themselves may be physically altered so that they cannot enjoy their favorite parts. For example, a man with a sweet tooth may have his brain rewired so that he cannot taste "sweet" flavors, while a marijuana addict may have the pleasure center of his brain numbed so that, even if he ingests the drug, he cannot derive its traditional effects (in turn leading to his going through withdrawals). Even by real world standards, that's pretty hellish treatment; in fact, it would fall squarely in the area of Cruel and Unusual<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bd1j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bd1j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bd1j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It doesn't help that surgical repression is considered a crime against humanity, and was infamously practiced in Nazi concentration camps and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">The Gulag</a></span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">And that's just the Appetizer.</a></em>
</li><li> The rest of the prison's "Full Course Menu" follows: the Second Level aka Soup Course involves edible, yet disgustingly smelly and bad tasting food, after that comes physical harm. With Fish, comes actual starvation, with the Meat dish, dehydration. People hardy enough to stand all that are then kept in Solitary Confinement with the Main Course, but then comes the Salads, Desserts, and Drinks. Respectively, those lead to being sliced up by knives, boiled alive, then finally seared with flame, before they drop your carcass over into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil">Death Season Forest</a>, home to razor sharp trees and grass where the Shrike would feel at home. None of this is without the regular executions like quartering.

Almost the entire surface is covered in lava. On one of the few landmasses is an energy production plant, crewed by Decepticons who are given just enough energy to function, and are in constant danger of falling into a lava flow and melting.

It is possible to be rescued from it, however; Darseid seems able to rescue a prisoner from it, and was himself rescued by an alternate version of himself due to a deal they made. Batman was once able to rescue Superman using the Highfather's staff. It is rare, however, for the Wall to be intentionally used as a prison (except maybe by the Source itself); one time it was occurred when the Teen Titans trapped Superboy-Prime there after his return as it was the only type of prison they hadn't yet tried to contain him with

Only two breakouts have ever been successful, both perpetrated by the main character Tavi. The first was fairly straightforward, with Tavi taking advantage of how, as with a lot of Aleran engineering, no one had even <em>considered</em> that someone might make an attempt without the use of furies.

Since the Eyrie is several miles up, however, doing this would result in a gruesome death. To make matters worse, the wind howls day and night and the floor is in a slight downwards incline, meaning that prisoners often can't sleep due to the noise and the fear that they will roll off the edge. Unsurprisingly, most of them go mad and end up jumping off.

The island has a connection to Lamannia, the plane of primal nature, which massively increases the durability of wood and stone while also negating most magic used against it (including magic used to teleport or phase through it). The same effect also keeps food and drink eternally fresh and destroys all poisons. A small village exists on the island to reduce dependence on imports, and most communication with the outside world is conducted through magic. Before a person can even <em>visit</em> the island they must consent to having their mind read and being placed under curses which limit their combat ability; shapeshifters must also wear distinctive clothing at all times to prevent impersonation. <br/>The prison itself is surrounded by a pitch-black cloud which prevents anyone from seeing inside by physical or magical means, and is patrolled from the air by manticores. The only way in or out is through an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> corridor filled with heavy gates and armed guards. The hallways are filled with boobytraps which variously attack, cage, knock out or mind control anyone who passes through without authorisation, and are constantly moved around to prevent prisoners from mapping them. <br/>The guards are all members of House Kundarak, meaning they have the power to create magical wards and locks, and many have been given the ability to communicate telepathically (both with each other and with their associates on the mainland). The equipment at the guard stations includes a modified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBall">scrying device</a> that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeeTheInvisible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeeTheInvisible">see invisible creatures</a> and analyse magic, as well as alarms that sound if any of the wards on the island have been activated, and controls for a set of invisible forcefields that run throughout the prison; all of these function only for members of the Kundarak bloodline. Due to the prison incorporating a Kundarak research facility, a number of powerful wizards are usually nearby and can be called on for backup. Finally, in addition to the living guards the prison is also patrolled by a number of constructs known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Slaughterstone Eviscerators</a>. <br/>Extra-dangerous prisoners are sent to the Stone Ward, where they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">petrified</a> for the duration of their stay. <em>Incredibly</em> dangerous prisoners get sent to the Deep Ward, which lies at the bottom of a frictionless pit accessed through a single cableless elevator, and is kept in complete darkness at all times (relying on the dwarf guards' ability to see in the dark). Each cell in the Deep Ward is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor-Made Prison</a> with features such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">magic negation</a>, sound negation or indestructible walls... and some of the inhabitants are petrified too, just for good measure.

<ul><li> Sigil's prison is simply called The Prison, and it's <em>very</em> secure. (It was also where the Mercykillers, the group in charge of corrections, made their headquarters in the city.) The Mercykillers have an even more secure prison for the <em>worst</em> criminals called The Vault in Carceri. (How secure is it? Let me put it this way, Carceri is what planar beings call the place that mortals from the Prime Material Plane call Tartarus. Yep, the very same place where the Titans are locked up). And if a criminal does something where the Lady of Pain herself has to intervene (which is rare; she only does so if someone does something that catches her attention, like trying to let the gods into Sigil, trying to worship her, or causing so much unrest and chaos that people no longer feel safe) there are the Mazes, dimensional labyrinths that she imprisons transgressors in. Essentially, this is a life sentence of solitary confinement, but there is a way out; it's just very difficult to fine. (Note that this is considered the <em>lenient</em> sentence. Offenders who catch her in a bad mood are flayed alive by her shadow, an act which leaves the target <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>.)
</li><li> The Splat book <em>Fiendish Codex II: Hordes of the Abyss</em> mentions the 73rd layer of the Abyss, the Wells of Darkness. This place contains many inky, black pools of thick liquid, each one a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor-Made Prison</a> for a very powerful and destructive demon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that was sealed here by a Demon Lord, god, or group of gods. The most dangerous prisoner here is Apep, the King of Serpents who once daily challenged the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Egyptian god Ra</a> on his journey through the Twelve Hours of Night. Security is maintained by demonic zombies called bodaks, and some of the wells have additional guards. (In Apep's case, it's a bigger than average blackstone gigant, one of the most powerful golems known.) Escape is possible from this place, either through intervention from the gods or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryOfTheDamned">Lords of Woe</a>, but it's only happened four times in the eons-long history of the place. Surprisingly, the bodaks do not bother mortals or normal residents of the Abyss who only make brief visits (after one to four hours, you've overstayed your welcome, and they try to kill you) and some people do come here, though they can only leave if they drop off a prisoner ("leave behind incapacitated" counts as dropping off, thankfully for any less-than-godly entities). Either they're servants of a prisoner who are foolish enough to think escape is possible or who try to ease his suffering with sacrifices, or they're a group who try to perform a ritual to communicate with a prisoner. Many of them are incredibly ancient, and know dark secrets which they are willing to share - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">for a price.</a>

Celestia</a> has a place like this for the most vile of mortals (usually those who try to strike against the Upper Planar gods themselves) and escape is truly impossible without conquering Celestia itself. (Whether this is an actual building or not is unknown.)

<ul><li> The Imperial City prison is treated as one in-universe, but it is subverted when you consider that two games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">Arena</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>) force you to break out of it at the start of the game. (You do get some help in <em>Oblivion</em>, but you can return later during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a> questline to break <em>in</em> and it's still quite easy.)

The Temple uses it to imprison dissident priests and religious criminals (the interpretation of this is deliberately vague, and in fact one of the Dissident Priests' charges against the mainstream Temple). You never have to escape from imprisonment in it, but main quest mission has you break an ally <em>out</em> of it. Fortunately, this only requires getting in — you aren't expected to actually lead your ally out, just hand her a scroll allowing her to teleport away (prisoners have their magic drained and aren't allowed to keep scrolls, and the guards are religious fanatics, thus why this method doesn't work for prisoners without outside aid) and then use another copy of the scroll to follow her. This can turn the prison into something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a> if you have become the Patriarch of the Temple, as you can simply walk in and ask for keys and directions.

<ul><li> Cidhna Mine. You can escape from every other prison in the game, but not from this one, without outside help. The only possible escape route becomes available when <em>you</em> act as outside help to the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> imprisoned within (or by killing him and looting his body for the key), and it works only once, so you can't use it yourself if you land in Cidhna Mine later. The only way out is to do force labor for the Silver-Blood Family. "You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one."
</li><li> The Chill, Winterhold's prison, is no slouch either. It is obviously inspired by Azkaban, which is natural, given that Winterhold is a mage city; it's an unmarked mine out in the middle of nowhere guarded by Frost Atronachs and infested by animals, Having a "Realistic Hypothermia" mod makes to no less than another Cidna Mine. The benefit of this prison is the guards leave you with all your gear.

The point of this place is that you don't leave. Its highest security level is especially bad; the prisoners are kept in cryogenic sleep inside vats (prolonged contact to which seems to have damaging effects on one's psyche and/or mental abilities), and are only awakened for exercise five minutes per day. Riddick finds an exploitable flaw in the system and gets out.
</li><li> Bargate Prison in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> games, which you have to escape from after being captured in the first. Then there's the Spire in the second game, where you've been as a guard for ten years trying to rescue a character. You then fight your way past legions of guards and sail a ship out of the Spire back to the mainland.
</li><li> Corel Prison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> <em>can</em> be escaped from...the problem is, it's in the middle of an endless desert and you'd probably die of thirst before you made it out. The desert has quicksand too.
</li><li> The D-District Prison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> is pretty hard to escape from, given that it sics guards with Sleep spell training on you, lots of monsters and mechs of varying types, has powerful anti magic barriers, and requires heavy machinery to even reach certain parts of the place. (The main body of the prison is actually three giant vertical screws, allowing it to dig into and out of the sand.) Like Corel prison, it is also in the middle of a desert - so even if the prisoner escapes, without any way of getting back safely, they're not going to be surviving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> has Via Purifico, an underground labyrinth that even requires swimming to get anywhere.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a></em> game series features one in the first game mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony">Penal Colony</a>. The prison is the magic barrier that surrounds the penal colony, but inside the colony you can do whatever you want. However, in keeping with the trope, the barrier makes escape impossible, and the whole point of the game is try and find a way past the magic walls.

While the world's pit cells are escapable for Keyblade welders and their allies, there is still the matter of being trapped inside the world <em>itself</em> whenever the computer is turned off. It only took turning it back on from the inside that the world loses it's prison status.

The latter's inmates on death row couldn't be killed by normal means, so they were instead banished to another dimension. Its only known "escapee" is Ganondorf himself, though he actually escaped as he was being sent there and needed the Triforce of Power to do so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> has Purgatory, a prison-ship run by mercenaries that is half legitimate business and half protection racket. Prisoners who governments are unable to house but unwilling to execute are housed in self-contained cells which can be vented into space; in case of a riot entire cell blocks can be vented. The warden charges exorbitant amounts to house the prisoners with the understanding that missed payments may see the prisoner released at an undisclosed location on their homeworld. The threat of releasing prisoners in ports when resupplying also nets them discounts. Alternatively, the Warden is more than happy to sell prisoners to anyone who can pay more than he makes from the maintenance fees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> X</em> features Fort Laegaire in the <em>The Falcon &amp; the Unicorn</em> DLC. Named for Laegaire the Mad, the Emperor of the Holy Falcon Empire who commissioned the prison, Fort Laegaire is located on a small island far out at sea (too far for any non-amphibious being to swim to shore from), has its wall enchanted so that magic can't pass out of them (stopping magical calls for help. The fort has a balcony which is open enough to not be subject to that, but the only entrance to it is from the commandant's office), and features an extensive aerial defence system, stopping anyone from approaching or leaving via air. The prison function was supposedly abandoned after Laegaire's death, with the fort later re-purposed as a base for anti-piracy operations by the Unicorn Duchy, but in actually the Duke of Unicorn has maintained it as a prison, using it to dump any people he wants or needs to 'disappear' without such pesky things as trials. It <em>would</em> still be a proper Alcatraz, but is compromised by the guards being corrupt and/or dissatisfied with what is going on. Combine that with your characters being imprisoned <em>after</em> beating the main game...
</li><li> The Gulag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em>. The player character has to go there at one point to break out one specific prisoner.

</li><li> An old Xbox game called <em>Prisoner of War</em> has the character escape from <em>five</em> German prison camps from WWII, including Stalag Luft and Colditz Castle (see Real Life below). While foiling a Nazi rocket program at the same time. In fact, he escapes from the fourth prison camp, just so he can go to the fifth! Guy is a damn Houdini.

Naturally the main character got all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> he's faced so far to help create havoc and escape. All this for a present. The main character Danny finds out he can escape the prison by just walking, the prison is in the Ghost Zone where ghosts live, and ghosts cannot go through the walls of that prison, but when he reverts back to his human form, he finds out that he and all humans can walk through the walls like ghosts.

One of the biggest reasons it was escape-proof was because the winch to operate the drawbridge that was the only way in or out was so heavy, only the giant who guarded it could turn it. The giant actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">wasn't a bad guy</a>; Venger was blackmailing him by threatening to destroy his homeworld. (Apparently, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">in the same situation as the heroes</a>.) Naturally, when Venger sent the heroes to this awful place, the giant proved a valuable ally when they launched a mass-jailbreak and destroyed the whole facility.

Huckleberry is the warden of a prison in the middle of nowhere, from which nobody escapes... because the amusement parks and various entertainments inside make the place so darn <em>fun</em>. In fact, Huckleberry's problem in that cartoon isn't a criminal trying to break out, it is one who'd served his sentence trying to break back <em>in</em>.
</li><li> Early in Book 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, the four members of the Red Lotus get one of these each.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SilverHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SilverHawks">SilverHawks</a></em>, the Penal Planet serves this purpose. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mon*Star</a> broke out in the first episode thanks to a burst of light from the Moon*Star of Limbo which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">transforms Mon*Star</a> and gives him the strength to break free.
</li><li> Stalagmite 17 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Slugterra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Slugterra">Slugterra</a></em> is the most highly guarded prison in all of SlugTerra. Stalagmite 17 first appeared in "Mission: Improbable", where Mister Saturday took over and zombified the staff. After a fusion shot failed, Mr. Saturday captured and placed the Shane Gang in Stalagmite 17. Eventually this caused Burpy and Pronto to come and break the gang out. In later episodes, it was used by the Shane Gang to incarcerate the most dangerous criminals in SlugTerra and, for the most part, it succeeded in holding them.

It's explicitly stated, that even if someone manages to escape the institute, they still can't really go anywhere because the landscape is almost impossible to cross — especially while being chased.

Since the actual prison complex is surrounded by a dense jungle, escaping the prison proper doesn't mean you're home free. What's more, the warden, Mr. Moss keeps dangerous animals bred for tracking down escapees. And since a 'terra' in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a> means a tall peak surrounded by a volcanic wasteland, without a pre-arranged ride you'd be out of luck. Aerrow manages to escape, and spends the episode dodging Mr. Moss' forces until his friends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who by this time have freed the <em>rest</em> of the prison while it was left defenseless because Moss called all of his men on the search.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em>, from the series of the same name, seems almost <em>ridiculously</em> inescapable. For one thing, it's on top of a volcano... which apparently grew right in the middle of <em>another</em> volcano (so, you know, lava moat), which is on a desert island and it's probably in another dimension. One character manages to escape by the end of the first episode. It's a good thing too; in Superjail, you go in... and that's about it.

Anyone sent there is either frozen or placed in a capsule and then shot down to the surface from space. Anyone that gets out must deal with large ice snakes with an ice breath that can freeze lightning, freezing to death, finding any food and supplies, and avoiding roaming gangs attacking intruders. Without a spaceship, the only way out is a single portal heavily reinforced with magic. Anyone who could get through that would arrive on the ocean planet of Andros and be confronted by the mermaid guards at the portal. When the Trix are sent there, they free another prisoner, Valtor. They locate the portal and manage to break it open while simultaneously brainwashing the mermaid guards. They then stroll free, leaving the portal open for other prisoners to escape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> has the prison of Cavigor where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">Prince Phobos</a> sends rebels and anyone else that opposes him.

Cavigor was in the original comics, but was just a regular prison on a hill. Both versions have giant cockroaches as guard dogs, just to add to the charm.
</li><li> Belle Reve in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> is a supermax facility located in the Louisana bayou, and built to house most, if not all, of the strongest and deadliest of super villains. The only thing keeping all the inmates at bay are special collars designed to negate their individual powers, and shock them into submission if they break the rules. Then somebody figured out having the baddest villains under the same roof was a plus, so the evil cabal known as the "Light" engineers a failed escape attempt, (by having ice-based villains purposly caught and brought to Belle Reve to freeze the walls solid and smash through them,) that allows one of their agents to be put in charge of the facility. Despite all the major villains being unable to escape, Edward Nygma, aka "The Riddler", is the only one that manages to break out during the ice-villains' attempt, after being harrassed for so long, and called a loser and second-rate criminal.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is Alcatraz, the famous prison in San Francisco Bay set out on a rock.
<ul><li> The most successful escape attempt was a man (John K Giles - a pretty awesome guy in his own right) who stole an Army uniform, snuck onto an Army laundry boat, and took it to Angel Island (another island in San Francisco Bay) where he was immediately apprehended. It says something that this is considered successful. (However, see below for speculation regarding escapees who were never found.)
</li><li> This trope is so famous that, in direct competition with the 140.6 mile Iron Man endurance triathlon, San Francisco now holds an Escape from Alcatraz triathlon, which starts with the athletes diving off the prison island and swimming to shore, before completing a bike race and foot race.
</li><li> Ironically, Alcatraz itself has spent more years as a tourist attraction than as a federal prison (it spent 29 years, from 1934 to 1963, as a prison, but has been a tourist attraction since 1972, passing the length of time it spent as a prison in 2001).
</li><li> Frank Morris and John and Clarence Anglin may or may not have escaped. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters">proved their escape possible</a>, and even took San Francisco Bay tidal movements and Morris' high intelligence into consideration and concluded that he could have ditched their equipment upon reaching the mainland and have it wash up on Angel Island, giving the impression they drowned. Given that no sign of them has ever turned up, it will likely never be known if they actually survived. There are some evidence that all three survived, and lived for a period in Brazil, but no definitive proof has surfaced.
</li><li> Before Morris and the Anglins, there were Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe. They are also presumed to have drowned, but no bodies were ever found. Like Morris and the Anglins, there were suggestions that they survived.
</li><li> Six months after Morris and the Anglins, John Paul Scott and Darl Lee Parker also made a break for it. Parker broke an ankle and was captured shortly afterwards, but Scott actually managed to swim to shore. He was too frozen and exhausted to continue his escape afterwards and was apprehended. The Escape from Alcatraz triathlon has the competitors swimming the same route Scott took for its first portion.

</li><li> The prison (and escape) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em> was based off a real one, Stalag Luft III.
</li><li> While somewhat more famous in Britain, Colditz Castle was another 'inescapable' WWII POW camp. The population was composed entirely of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam">men who had already escaped from other prisons</a> and 15 managed to escape even here (there was a 16th who got out, but he wasn't heard from again).
</li><li> Devil's Island was a notorious and "inescapable" island in the French Guiana Penal Colony. It was protected by rocky cliffs and powerful tides, if you didn't die on the way down the sea would smash you into the rocks. Numerous hardened criminals were sent to Devil's Island along with political prisoners, and there were several alleged escapes including Henri Charrière of <em>Papillon</em> fame.
</li><li> Chateau d'If, most famous for its role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em>, was a real life island in the middle of nowhere to keep political prisoners who were too important to kill locked up. No real prisoner ever escaped.
</li><li> Giacomo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Casanova</a> (yes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TropeNamers/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TropeNamers/RealLife">Trope Namer</a>) managed to escape from the supposedly inescapable Doge's Palace.
</li><li> All of West Berlin for an inverted example. East Germany spent enormous amounts of money to keep people from <em>breaking in</em>.
</li><li> The British prison on the Rock of Gibraltar.
</li><li> Portlaoise Prison in the Republic of Ireland contains Ireland's most dangerous criminals, members of dangerous drug gangs and criminals serving life sentences for serious crime. A number of Irish Republican prisoners are still in the old E Block. Anyone charged under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act must be sent to the prison because of its unique security measures. The prison has a capacity for 399 prisoners, but because of the security sensitive nature of its inmates, it operates below this capacity. A large number of well armed Irish Defence Forces soldiers guard the prison 24 hours a day, making it one of the most secure prisons in Europe. The security features include a army detachment consisting of approx Company strength, armed with assault rifles and anti-aircraft machine guns, who guard the prison complex. An air exclusion zone operates over the entire complex. The perimeter consists of high walls, cameras, sensors and acres of tank traps.
</li><li> Elba was supposed to be this for Napoleon. Despite being an island guarded by the British Navy, he managed to escape after 300 days. After Waterloo, he was exiled to Saint Helena, a barren and isolated chunk of rock in the South Atlantic 1500 miles off the coast of Africa, guarded by a 2,000 man garrison and two warships that patrolled the coast. He didn't escape that time.
</li><li> Australia was a penal (prison) colony for Britain for the greater part of the 19th century, and well beyond swimming distance to someplace better, and certainty prohibitively far from England, which was the point. In turn, Tasmania was the penal colony for Australia—that is, if after being transported to Australia from Britain and committed another serious offence, you'd go to Tasmania. The same, generally speaking, was true of Queensland; Brisbane is sufficiently far from the rest of Australian civilization to tell you why. And for those the British government was <em>really</em> angry at, there was Norfolk Island: After a failed rebellion there, some of the rebels were sentenced to hang, but had to have the sentences confirmed in Sydney. When some of the condemned found out that they would be spared, they wept and cursed their fate, while those who were to die rejoiced that at least they would not be on Norfolk Island any longer.
</li><li> The Marias Islands in Mexico.
</li><li> During World War II, Nazi Concentration camps were a subversion, as they were neither escape-proof, nor sneak-proof. Alongside people who smuggled various objects inside, who spied and relayed some bits of info to partisans or Allied spies, who helped some prisoners to escape, the prisoners themselves were usually taken out for forced labor in quarries, construction sites or armament factories. The secrecy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a> was not maintained by guarding those <em>living</em> inside, but by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">exterminating most of the new arrivals in the first three hours after disembarking from trains</a>.
</li><li> The most secure prison in the United States is ADX ("Administrative Maximum Facility") Florence, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies", opened in 1994 as a containment facility for inmates too dangerous for even maxiumum security. Just for starters ADX is part of a four-prison complex surrounded by open ground and is at the far end of the prison access road watched by almost a dozen guard towers. Inmates at higher security levels never see another inmate, are forbidden phone calls, and cell windows view only the sky to prevent inmates from knowing where they are. In addition there are the razor-wire fence, hundreds of security cameras, 1400 steel doors, and various other security devices. As a result of the massive security, ADX's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADX_Florence#Notable_current_inmates">inmate list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a Who's Who of international drug lords and terrorists.
<ul><li> ADX manges to have an even more extreme "ultramax" inside a supermax: Range 13, a small block of zero-human-contact cells. Thomas Silverstein, whose 1983 murder of a prison guard at USP Marion prison inspired the design of ADX, served his three life sentences on Range 13 before dying in 2019.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States, in response to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, created two medium-security "Communication Management Units" in 2007 and 2008 at FCI Terre Haute and USP Marion to house convicted terrorists and tightly restrict their communications to the outside world. Certain prisoners whose communications are considered an exceptional risk can be subject to "Special Administrative Measures" that isolate them further from human contact.
</li><li> Her Majesty's Prison Peterhead was described as "Scotland's gulag." It is an old, Victorian era building, initially serving prisoners doing hard labour. It only got electricity in 2005, and still doesn't have flush toilets for prisoners.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Island,_County_Cork">Spike Island<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was this when it was used as a prison. In 1985, a riot occured culminating in the prisoners burning down one of the prison blocks. Of course, they were all rounded up, as getting off the island without a boat was impossible.
</li><li> Several in Russia, such as White Swan (in Solikamsk), Black Dolphin (in Sol Iletsk), Fire Island (in Vologda Oblast). These supermaxes were built for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">vory</a></em>, Chechen terrorists and similar especially dangerous criminals sentenced to lifetime imprisonment. Another one, infamous in Mafiya and gopnik circles, is the Vladimir Central. There is a <em>shanson</em> song dedicated to it. Note that Russian supermaxes are either from the Tsarist times (like the Vladimir Central) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia">recently built</a>. The Soviets did not believe in this trope, using either lax but very distant, frozen penal colonies or the death penalty.
</li><li> Camp Delta, more commonly - and inaccurately - referred to as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has imprisoned a variety of people taken captive by the US in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, ranging from actual terrorists to completely innocent people to children as young as 12. There are 12 guards for every one prisoner, and waterboarding and other forms of torture were performed regularly until 2008. Escape is considered virtually impossible; even then, an escaped prisoner would find himself in the middle of a US Navy base and having to cross the heavily guarded border with Cuba or swim across the Windward Passage to Haiti.
</li><li> Tadmor Military Prison in Syria, home of rebels and political dissidents. The prison can only be accessed through a single long tunnel, through which those wishing to get in must <em>crawl</em>. During the 1980s, it was infamous as somewhere the regime cast people too important to execute but too dangerous to release - it was nothing more than a hole for them to die in. Closed during the 1990s, it has now been re-opened to hold rebel prisoners taken in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. Completely destroyed by the so-called Islamic State or ISIL after they captured Palymra in May 2015.
</li><li> La Gorgona Island served as Colombia's most secure prison for decades. Not only was it far from the mainland, but the prison itself was deep within the island's snake-infested jungle, which the prisoners would have to cross if they even wished to reach the sea (which was infested with <em>sharks</em>). Only three successful escapes were recorded during its operation, and all were caught and returned relatively quickly.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C&lt;!--C3--&gt;B4n_&lt;!--C3--&gt;90&lt;!--C3--&gt;BA%A3o_Prison">Côn Đảo prison<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where the French colonial government (and later US-backed South Vietnam) jailed those considered especially dangerous, and subjected them to hard labor, torture, and inhumane living conditions. Hundreds of escape attempts were staged continuously. It was closed after the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> and is open as a tourist attraction today.
</li><li> South Africa has Robben Island, located right off the coast of Cape Town. A small, barren lime quarry of an island, this is where anti-Apartheid activist Nelson Mandela spent most of his years in prison. During his imprisonment, intellectual activity was active on that island, hence calling it a "university". Nowadays, it's a tourist attraction and a World Heritage Site.
</li><li> Tarrafal (aka Chão Bom in the Sixties and Seventies) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CapeVerde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CapeVerde">Cape Verde</a> was a combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony">Penal Colony</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar">New State</a> opponents and colonial independence fighters. It was infamous for the overall bad conditions of the place, as well as the <em>frigideira</em> ("frying pan"), an isolation unit made entirely of zink in which - due to being completely closed as well as the climate being tropical - many prisoners died of insolation.
