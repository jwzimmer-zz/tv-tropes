Etzel Pearcy, a geography professor at California State University, Los Angeles, in 1975. Pearcy's strategy groups cities together based on population centers, shared services, and similarity of lifestyle (for example, the New York metro area would be one state, rather than expanding into New Jersey and using bits of Connecticut and Pennsylvania as suburbs), so they would make reasonable estimates of the territory each neo-state could control. On paper, such a concept could save the country billions each year, but the obvious political <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0n87v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0n87v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0n87v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the proposed state of Allegheny alone, the battle between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> over which would be the capital would be epic.

There was a fair amount of corruption in Turtalia, as well as a number of soldiers in Dorado who sincerely believed that the only way to preserve civilization was to enforce totalitarian rule until things stabilized, and had no doubt that they were in the right and that the Turtalians were deluded idealists whose society would eventually collapse on itself.

Meanwhile, out on the west coast, there is the California Confederacy, headed by a "Chief Confederate". There is also a Chicago Imperium which, despite the name, controls the entire Upper Midwest.

Texarkana is the name of a city that straddles the border of Texas and Arkansas, likely one of the cities that managed to escape the war, and became a power center when people began to rebuild civilization. There's also the Kingdom of Laredo (based in what used to be Laredo, Texas), a cowboy-esque nomadic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">warrior culture</a> (a little along the lines of the Mongols) who look down on the agrarian "grass-eaters" of Texarkana.

The Union and the Rim don't get on particularly well, but both are united in their mutual distaste for the Republic, which is more than reciprocated.

<ul><li> In <em>Disunited States of America</em>, every state becomes its own country after the United States ceases to exist because they kept the Articles of Confederation. California is an economic and technological superpower in the region and is one of the most liberal societies, while many former slave-owning states in the South have a racial caste/hierarchy/apartheid system where the white people are the top of the ladder while the blacks are treated like trash (with the exception of Mississippi, where the racial oppression is reversed). Some states are also geographically different, including a United Virginia, a United Carolina, and the state of Boone (Kentucky and half of Tennessee). Since every state is its own country, there are many conflicts in North America, such as the Florida Intervention (the state was forcibly split into three parts, one of which becomes owned by Cuba). Most of the plot centers around Virginia, where Ohio decided to piss off that state and start a war by spreading a genetically modified measles virus and supplying weapons to the oppressed black population in Virginia.
</li><li> Another Turtledove work, <em>The Vally-Westside War</em>, depicts the US far more thoroughly broken up in the aftermath of a nuclear war in 1967. A hundred years later, there are a score of sovereign nations in the territory of the city of Los Angeles alone, each with its own national pride, a specific system of government, hereditary enemies, a miniature national army and protective tariffs to defend the national product. In the whole of the former US territory, there must be many thousands of such mini-states.

Along with the obvious, some of the states in this timeline are different from real life. North and South Dakota are one state (just called Dakota), and Arizona and New Mexico are also just New Mexico. Down South, the Confederates bought the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora. They also have Oklahoma, which is called Sequoya and was given to Native Americans. The books range from the year 1881 to the 1940s. More changes take place, such as a piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Texas being broken off and renamed Houston</a>.

Much of America ends up as a bone-littered wasteland, but in the inhabitable parts, small countries and fiefdoms of every stripe spring up; what used to be Oregon ends up with a half-dozen or so. <br/><br/>In the later books, all the little nations in Oregon have formed a UN-like organisation, and we have the Church Universal and Triumphant that initially occupies what is roughly Montana, the United States of Boise which is basically Idaho (but calls itself just the United States because it thinks of itself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>), and New Deseret, the Mormon theocracy based in Utah. So large states do survive in some areas. <br/><br/>Further east, about a dozen new nations form around the east side of the Mississippi—the Republics of Fargo, Marshall and Kirksville, the Provisional Republic of Iowa, the State of Nebraska and the Emergency Powers Zone of Concordia (basically Kansas). The rest of the U.S. is either a death zone full of corpses and cannibals (the highly populated areas, like the East Coast and California) or small townships, in places like the Gulf of Mexico and the remote parts of the Appalachians. This is a completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>; considering just how much our civilization relies on the electricity and oil that become useless, it's not surprising that this occurs, - though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a> applies, considering that Great Britain survives with its monarchy intact.

Afterward, the U.S. government quarantines the southern East Coast, where most of the bio-weapons spread, from New York down to the tip of Florida, and west to the Mississippi. Mexico grabs a strip of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and almost all of the California coast; New England and each northernmost state along the border become a Canadian Protectorate.

While this is a global event, the main focus is on the United States and its disintegration over the course of the series. By the time the series is done: after the nuking of DC, two rival governments emerge — the Provisional Constitutional Government, based in Olympia, Washington, which directly controls the Pacific Northwest and has influence over the entire western half of the country, and the Temporary National Government, based in Athens, Georgia, which controls most of the South (and which is later taken over by religious extremists who declare the region the Christian States of America). Utah, Texas, and California (which is taken over by a neo-feudal movement and declared a duchy) become highly autonomous, with the latter two eventually seceding. Alaska secedes early on. Hawaii dissolves into chaos and loses contact with the mainland. Arizona loses territory to California and Nevada, as well as the newly declared Apache and Navajo nations. Oklahoma likewise loses its eastern half to Native American independence, resulting in the Allied First Nations and Western Oklahoma. Montana is part of the PCG, but has strong movements for both independence and federating with Alberta. And then there's the Lost Quarter, the entire region north of the Carolinas and east of Kentucky and Illinois, which is so heavily devastated by the immediate and after effects of Daybreak and overrun by pro-Daybreak tribals that any large government in the area is impossible. That said, there are a few centers of civilization — Castle Earthstone in Indiana, a tribal stronghold that declares independence from Daybreak and eventually establishes a Domain around the eastern Great Lakes region; Pelissipi, several counties along the Virginia/West Virgina border region which banded together to drive off the tribals and found a new state; and Manbrookstat, which is technically just a city-state operating out of the ruins of New York City, but whose totalitarian leader, the Commandant, declares nominal control of all Lost Quarter territory not claimed by the TNG/CSA or the Domain. And further complicating things is the Commandant founding the Atlantic League (a confederacy of similar city-states around the Atlantic), and opening the Lost Quarter to colonization by his partners.

It is the Allied States of America, a corporate dictatorship <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">( at least some of whose leaders were behind the catastrophe)</span> which rules the states west of the Mississippi (except Texas) and has its capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The other is what's left of the legitimate federal government, with its capital in Columbus, Ohio <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(notably the city Hawkins was supposed to deliver his bomb to)</span>. Off on its own, able to tip the balance is the fully independent Republic of Texas. Season 1 makes a mention of <em>six</em> federal governments, and briefly shows a map with Sacramento, California; Cheyenne, Wyoming; San Antonio, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Albany, New York; and Montgomery, Alabama marked as capitals. There is also mention of a Senator from Oregon and a Senator from Alabama making claims to the Presidency. By season 2, though, this has been narrowed down to the above two governments and the Republic of Texas.
</li><li> When discussing the six factions in Season 1 mentioned above, it is stated that one of those claiming the Presidency, the man who eventually becomes the (off-screen) leader of the eastern States in Season two and thus the United States, is actually the legal and legitimate successor to the Presidency as he was a member of the late President's cabinet when the attacks occurred.

In addition, there is the Brotherhood of Steel, comprising the remnants of a US Army unit operating from the Lost Hills bunker. The Brotherhood deserves special mention; the original army unit seceded <em>before</em> the Great War after they discovered that the scientists they were protecting at the Mariposa Military Base were experimenting on human subjects for their biological weapons. Led by Captain Roger Maxson (their original commander killed himself when he discovered what was really going on), the unit declared independence from the Union on October 20, 2077... only to receive no response.

<ul><li> A military government led by Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur, nicknamed the Khakis, which controls Washington D.C., the Rockies, and the overseas possessions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After MacArthur dies during a hurricane, the Whites seize D.C., the Japanese occupy the Pacific territories, a Filipino corps stationed in Alaska begins a revolt against the Khakis there, and several Generals and Admirals become independent warlords, with Admiral Ernest King leading a rump loyalist faction out of the Alaskan Panhandle. Most of the warlords eventually align themselves with the Red Oak Pact as the war draws to a close.</span>
</li><li> The American Soviet Republic, led by Communist Party General-Secretary Earl Browder, which controls a stretch of land from their capital at Chicago to New York City. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The east coast Soviets, feeling that Browder is too authoritarian, eventually split and form the American Workers Collective, forming an anti-fascist Popular Front with the Blues. The ASR proper joins the Popular Front after a coup but turns against it once the Whites are all but defeated. Their defeat to the Red Oak Pact/Popular Front marks the end of the Second Civil War.</span>
</li><li> The Whites, lead by Huey Long, are a collection of conservative and fascist groups composed of an official government and military under Long, and several paramilitary groups (ranging from the KKK and openly fascist groups to Businessmen's Associations, essentially armed Hoover Republicans) with strong influence over local governments. They control the South, Texas, parts of the Southwest, and eastern New England, with their capital in Montgomery, Alabama. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They seize Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia after the Khakis' leadership is decapitated, but a failed coup by a group of generals fearing the growth of fascist influence causes the fascists to effectively take over. New England defects to the Continental Congress as a result, and between that, the ASR joining the Popular Front, and the fascists' dysfunctional leadership, the Whites fall apart and are soon overrun.</span>
</li><li> The Provisional Government, also called the Blues, lead by John L. Lewis. A coalition of liberals and democratic socialists, they control the upper Midwest, upstate New York, western New England, and the West Coast, with their capital in St. Paul, Minnesota. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They form an alliance with the Continental Congress known as the Red Oak Pact, and later one with the AWC called the Popular Front. With Canadian backing, the Red Oak Pact/Popular Front defeats the Whites and then the ASR, winning the civil war.</span>
</li><li> The Continental Congress, also called the Greens, led by Milo Reno. Composed of Midwestern farmers who don't like any of the other factions, they control the Great Plains from Montana to Oklahoma. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They align themselves with the Blues in the Red Oak Pact, and count themselves among the winners.</span>
</li><li> And several other independent groups:
<ul><li> William Langer, Governor of North Dakota, has declared secession from the Union. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's eventually brought to heel by Canada.</span>
</li><li> Sumner Sewell, Governor of Maine. While not declaring secession, he cooperates closely with Canada and aligns himself with whichever (American) group gives him the most independence. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually sides with the Continental Congress, with White New England surrendering to him after they defect to the Red Oak Pact. Post-war, Maine (which now controls most of New England east of the Connecticut River) enjoys a great deal of autonomy within the Third Republic.</span>
</li><li> The B.R.O.W.N. (Banner Revolutionary Organisation of Willing Negroes), a guerrilla group operating in the White territory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This causes the Whites to begin putting blacks in concentration camps where over a million of them die of disease and starvation. As the Whites fall apart, they align with the Red Oak Pact/Popular Front, and after the war, the former states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia are merged into the autonomous black state of New Africa.</span>
</li><li> Henry Ford, who controls Detroit as his own personal fiefdom using army troops and mercenaries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's eventually defeated by the Blues.</span>

<ul><li> The Guatemala Incorporated timeline has an example based on <em>The Falcon Cannot Hear</em> above. In this universe, a Second American Civil War broke out in the 1930s, which resolved in a ceasefire between variant claimants to legitimacy — a military government runs the Pacific holdings from Hawaii (though is now a Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState">Puppet State</a>), the Constituent Assembly controls the West Coast and part of the southwest, the British-backed Continental Congress controls most of the center of the continent, the American Soviet Republic controls things from New England to the Great Lakes and down to part of the Upper South, and a remnant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">fascist "White"</a> movement controls Florida. There are also several breakaways — Maine declared independence and eventually joined Canada (taking part of New Hampshire with it), most of the Deep South and part of the Upper South is the black socialist Republic of New Africa, there's a warlord state running things in the region surrounding the Grand Canyon, and the US Navy forces in Guantanamo (while technically loyal to the military government) run it as a <em>de facto</em> city-state.
</li><li> In the Southron Popular Republic timeline, the Confederate States win the American Civil War and successfully break away. But furthermore, after the CSA ends up on the losing side of the Great War, they suffer a Communist revolution, which results in Texas and the Indian Republic (OTL Indian Territories/Oklahoma) breaking away and declaring independence. And back in the US, a second civil war breaks out in the 1930s due to a public backlash against government corruption during the Great Depression; by the time it's done, California has declared its own independence.

<h2>In General</h2>
<ul><li> There are <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_separatist_movements_in_North_America#United_States">quite a few<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> active organizations arguing for peaceful secession. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the main complaints cited are high taxes and an overbearing Federal government.
</li><li> This idea seems much less likely than fiction writers would have it. There are many cultural, economic, and military factors to discourage such a split, and all but the fringiest of U.S. regional and factional interests seem agreed to pursue their interests through the shared democratic process. Historically, though, scenarios like this <em>often</em> seem impossible right up to the second they become inevitable.
</li><li> The legalities involved in state secession can go several ways. On one hand, all thirteen of the original colonies predate the United States by definition, since it was these states which ratified the Constitution and brought the federal government into existence. Under the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_theory">Compact Theory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of government, any U.S. state can lawfully secede from the Union if the state legislature decides to do so. On the other hand, the Civil War made it clear that on the topic of secession, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>, and the US Supreme Court additionally ruled in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._White">Texas v. White<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> that unilateral secession is illegal <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7wbtf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7wbtf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7wbtf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The idea being that the US was originally founded under the Articles of Confederation which specified that the states would stand in "perpetual union," and that the Constitution specifies that it was written "to form a more perfect union." The court ruled that a union that was even "more perfect" than "perpetual" could not, logically, be broken unilaterally.</span>. Additionally, the Confederate Constitution made it clear that the Confederacy wouldn't look too kindly on states attempting to secede from <em>it</em> (Georgia came close to trying).
</li><li> Even the naming conventions in the United States hint at a looser union than actually exists. The subdivisions of the US are called "states", a term that normally applies to an independent or quasi-independent entity. The name of the country, the "United States of America", is a phrase describing the political union rather than the name of a State per se. These are all a result of the original "United States" being thought of as a loose coalition of the former colonies with the states being the primary powers and the federal government being much less relevant.
</li><li> Something that can throw foreign visitors is that the individual state governments have a lot more authority and jurisdiction over their affairs than in most places. Prostitution is illegal in most states, but Nevada has some (tightly regulated) brothels and legalized escort services. Marijuana? By Federal Law, it's a Class 1 (<em>highly</em> illegal) substance. But there are several states (Washington and Colorado as the vanguards) where marijuana is sold in licensed retail shops. Another case was where a lesbian couple was legally married in one state, but moved to another, and couldn't get a divorce because that state didn't acknowledge the marriage. This patchwork of state laws creates plenty of business and headaches for the federal court system, which sometimes has to decide which state's law trumps the other.
</li><li> The United States has already fought one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Civil War</a>, which resulted in four years of fighting and at least 700,000 deaths. This is still a sore subject in many places. Special mention should go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">the South</a>, where a few people still think the Confederacy should have won, and even those who don't still proudly fly its flag and will attempt to whitewash it of any wrongdoing. Note that some Southerners still use the terms "The Late Unpleasantness" and "The War of Northern Aggression," both examples of different names used to refer to the Civil War.
</li><li> Even within the states, the division isn't so much <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/urban-archipelago/">red state/blue state<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/106716/gop-gives-cities">as it is urban versus rural<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The 2016 presidential election had the majority of urban areas (which saw economic growth in the Obama administration) voting for Clinton. But outside the cities, where the recovery had been sluggish or hadn't reached them at all, decided to vote Trump, which shocked urban voters who believed the election was a sure thing for Clinton. Trumps victory was largely fueled by gains in working-Class and rural areas in the rust belt who felt disappointed in Obamas economic policies. The votes that shifted to Clinton were generally in well-educated voters where people who usually vote Republican on economic issues were alienated by Trumps temperament and the GOPs shift towards reactionary identity politics.
</li><li> Northern and Southern Indiana are very different. Northern Indiana is fairly flat while Southern Indiana is quite hilly. There's a ridge line that goes through Indiana that divides rivers between Lake Michigan and the Ohio River. That's where the glaciers stopped during the last Ice Age. There's a pretty sharp divide in how people to the North and to the South vote. Most of Indiana is fairly red, with notable exceptions being the Indianapolis area, the South Bend area, Northwest Indiana, and Bloomington (home to the main campus of Indiana University). At a speaking event that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> hosted in South Bend, Tyson joked that finding the cities on a map of Indiana was pretty easy since they were marked in blue! <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8vckx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8vckx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8vckx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For those of you unfamiliar with American politics, blue is the color used to represent Democrats, and is more often than not big in urban areas, whereas red is used to mark Republicans, and is more often than not found in rural areas. Tyson was referring to an election map that showed which county in the state voted for which party.</span>
<ul><li> Bloomington is often called the "San Francisco" of Indiana, and its home county of Monroe has typically been the most Democratic in the state. Within city limits, it's a very cosmopolitan city, with bike lanes, diverse populace, majority Democrat government and policies, and out and proud far left organizations. Go a few miles out of town, and it's a complete 180 on politics. People from outside of the country, especially non-white foreigners, are usually advised that while Bloomington is open and welcome, outside of the city may not be as accommodating.
</li><li> Northwest Indiana, in contrast to most of the state, is fairly urban, with the majority of its income reliant on being a bedroom community for Chicago, factories, tourism in by the beach areas and commercial services. The area is also heavily Democrat thanks to influences from Chicago, the large African American population in Gary, and the strong labor union presence due to industry. There are small movements (that haven't gained too much traction) that would love to see Chicago and NWI leave their respective states and form their own state. (Illinois is fairly conservative if you don't count Chicago.)
</li><li> There is a similar sentiment in the three counties in Southeast Wisconsin along the Lake Michigan Shoreline (Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha), which are significantly more liberal than the rest of Wisconsin (especially Milwaukee). Although it'll probably never happen, it's not hard to see why many desire a new state along Lake Michigan's southwestern shore. Especially with the Chicago and Milwaukee metro areas already overlapping as it is.
</li><li> If you go to Culver, IN you will find a whole bunch of locals who hate people from Chicago, Indianapolis, South Bend, and pretty much any other major city or country (the HS owns an airport).
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting historical footnote: When Congress started debating the KansasNebraska Act (or maybe it was the Missouri Compromise), some northern senators threatened to secede from the Union in protest against the way the debate was going. If they had actually done it, the <em>North</em> would have been the people rebelling against the Union.
</li><li> The non-fiction book <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Nations_of_North_America">The Nine Nations of North America<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> by Joel Garreau is about how this continent is divided geo-culturally into "New England", "Dixie", "The Bread Basket" etc. There are also anomalies (Manhattan, Washington DC, Hawaii and Alaska) that are their own subcultures. This is expanded upon in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.colinwoodard.com/americannations">American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> by Colin Woodard, which divides the US and Canada into about a dozen regional subcultures based on who happened to settle where first.
</li><li> In 1998, Russian professor <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Panarin">Igor Panarin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gave a 55% chance that the United States would break up by 2010. It gained a lot of media attention around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, though unless every news outlet in the world has been lying to us all for the past several years, his prediction has not come to pass. One of Panarin's conclusions was that a US breakup would be bad for Russia insofar as much of its trade is dependent on the US. He advocated trying to steer such a break-up more along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution">peaceful lines</a> like Czechoslovakia rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars">what happened in Yugoslavia</a> in the early 90's.
</li><li> In the 2002 edition of the <em>Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations</em>, the author defines a stateless nation as a group that self identifies as a distinctive group, displaying outward trappings of a national identity (especially, but not always, a flag) and the formation of political pressure groups for great autonomy. It has within the United States: New Englanders, Texans, Southerners, Californians, Mormons, at least five American Indian nations, Alaskans, and Cajuns.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesusland_map">Jesusland Map<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which shows how the U.S. tends to split in half in terms of political candidates. With the exception of a few "swing states", it's a pretty decent guide to political leanings in the U.S.
</li></ul><ul><li> After the 2012 elections, petitions were sent out to the "We The People" government website asking to leave the Union. At least one for each state was eventually sent.
</li><li> It is important to note that many of the founding fathers were federalists and that the constitution incorporates several federalist ideals. One of federalism main goals is to try to avert this trope by making all states have significant power in terms of representation.
</li><li> Primarily as a thought experiment, some commentators have proposed balkanizing the US to address issues with the Senate and the Electoral College. In the Senate, small states like Montana or Wyoming have equal representation as Texas and California, giving those states a disproportionate amount of power (this tends to benefit Republicans, as smaller states tend to be rural and more conservative than the big ones); and, while the Electoral College does reflect the will of the people the majority of the time, on four occasions (most recently in the 2016 Presidential Election, where Donald Trump won the electoral college despite losing the popular vote) they have differed; since a candidate can narrowly win crucial swing states while getting blown out in states safe for the other party the candidate with the most votes does not necessarily always win the Presidency. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9baqg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9baqg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9baqg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Worth noting, however, that such "issues" are an inherent part of the design of the U.S. political system. The disproportionate representation of the smaller states in the Electoral College and Senate serves as a check to prevent the larger ones from running roughshod over them, i.e. the "tyranny of the majority". Thus anyone who wants to get a bill passed or be elected President needs to get some buy-in from these states. Conversely, House seats are allocated proportionally, ensuring that the larger states still have plenty of say in lawmaking.</span>
<ul><li> One method is to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/10/if_every_u_s_state_had_the_same_population_what_would_the_map_of_america.html">redraw the state borders<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> so that the USA consists of fifty states of roughly equal population, this means that each pair of senators will represent the same number of people, and the electoral votes of each state will be roughly the same, so the Electoral College will better reflect the nationwide popular vote.
</li><li> Another proposal is to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/01/75-stars">split all larger states<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> into smaller ones of 4-5 million people, again making the Senate and Electoral College more representative as each of the new states sends their own senators and casts their own electoral ballots.
</li><li> A less radical proposal would be for all other states to allocate their electoral votes as Maine and Nebraska now do. In both states, the winner of the statewide vote is guaranteed only the two electoral votes corresponding to their U.S. Senators. Each remaining electoral vote goes to the winner of each individual U.S. House district. However, this doesn't account for congressional gerrymandering. Notably, Republicans won a majority of house seats even while losing the popular vote.
</li></ul></li><li> While America's territories frequently saw their borders redrawn before statehood, only twice has a state been carved out from another state.
<ul><li> The first was Maine, which was originally an exclave of Massachusetts whose residents had long grumbled in favor of secession due to their physical separation from the rest of the state. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a> only intensified these separatist feelings, as Mainers saw Massachusetts as unconcerned with the British on their doorstep. Maine was granted statehood in 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise, with Missouri entering the union as a slave state to compensate for the addition of a new free state in the northern US.
</li><li> The second was West Virginia. As in Maine <em>vis-à-vis</em> Massachusetts, many people in the mountainous western part of Virginia had long been disillusioned with the dominance of the state by the eastern lowland planters. As such, when Virginia declared for the Confederacy, the western counties took the opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousRebel">counter-secede</a> and rejoined the Union, and the state retained its independence after the war. Similar pro-Union sentiments existed throughout Appalachia; Kentucky remained in the Union despite being a slave state (a few pro-Confederates organized a secessionist government in the western part of the state, but never got far), while eastern Tennessee was a hotbed of partisan violence against the Confederacy.
</li></ul></li></ul><h2>The South</h2>
<ul><li> Oregon journalist Chuck Thompson has written a book titled <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Better-Off-Without-Manifesto-Secession/dp/1451616651">Better Off Without 'Em: A Northern Manifesto for Southern Secession<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, whose central thesis is that the South<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10udx7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10udx7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10udx7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which he defines as all states of the former Confederacy except Texas, plus West Virginia and Kentucky</span> stands alone as its own cultural nation among the geographical regions of the current United States and should be allowed to peacefully secede to allow the rest of America to move forward.
</li><li> These days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida">Florida</a>'s status as a Southern state exists mainly through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a>. Only the northern third of the state is still considered part of the South, while central and southern Florida are considered culturally 'Yankee' as its residents are mostly migrants from the northeast. As a result, many citizens in both the northern and southern parts of the state have proposed secession from the other half. In the north, there have been many attempts dating to before the Civil War to get the Panhandle to split off and join neighboring Alabama. (Curiously, there <em>was</em> a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Florida#Short-lived_Republic">Republic of West Florida<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for a brief period in 1810, but most of its territory is now part of southern Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.) To the south, meanwhile, the serious suggestion was made by the mayor of South Miami in 2014 to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/10/23/south_florida_as_51st_state_the_city_of_south_miami_votes_to_break_away.html">split the state in two<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> due to frustration with the state government's perceived lack of action on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming">Global Warming</a> (a major concern in low-lying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Miami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Miami">Miami</a>). <br/><br/>North and South Florida have long had a great deal of separation and antipathy. In the 19th century, southern Florida had been mostly empty and seen as economically useless, with the main economic activity being cattle, sugar, and shipping; between economic differences with northern Florida (which was invested heavily in plantation agriculture, particularly cotton) and the lack of easy travel, the southern half of Florida was essentially a separate entity from the north. This gap only grew (albeit in mutated form) when industrialization arrived, with large numbers of Northerners moving in for the sunny, frost-free weather, as railroads and air conditioning enabled resorts, retirement communities, and large-scale farming of citrus, winter fruit, and vegetables that could now be easily shipped north without fear of spoilage.
<ul><li> On the more tongue-in-cheek end, there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch_Republic">Conch Republic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a secession attempt made by the residents of the Florida Keys (particularly Key West) in 1982. A ton of illegal contraband, particularly drugs, had been trafficked through there, and for logistical reasons the Coast Guard decided to set up a checkpoint on the Florida mainland side of US Route 1 (the only road in or out of the Keys) and check everyone passing through — including Key residents trying to get to the mainland. The residents basically decided "fine, if you're going to treat us like a foreign country, we may as well become a foreign country!" Key West still uses the Conch Republic as a tourist lure to this day, selling flags and souvenir passports.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_New_Afrika">Republic of New Afrika<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a proposed country for African-Americans that was to be made from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, plus black-majority counties in neighboring states. Its proponents also called for reparations from the US government for centuries of slavery. As the group was involved in several violent confrontations, the FBI considered them a seditious group.

Bush, advocated for the secession of southern states into a new nation called "Reagan", a new country that would then be based on "traditional" Christian and conservative values.
</li></ul><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas">Texas</a></h2>
<ul><li> First there was the Texas Revolution—originally not to secede from Mexico, but to balkanize the Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas to give the recently immigrated Anglo Texans more control over local politics. Eventually, the rhetoric changed to favor complete separation, when it became clear the Mexican Government was not going to compromise. The increasingly anti-slavery stance of the Mexican government also contributed to this shift.
</li><li> Ten years later, after the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States (which triggered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar">war with Mexico</a>), the territory's original borders were minorly balkanized—parts of Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico once belonged to the Republic of Texas.
</li><li> While that annexation treaty did not actually allow the state of Texas to secede if it wished, as is sometimes incorrectly implied, it does allow Texas to balkanize itself into up to five separate states if it so wishes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ayl1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ayl1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ayl1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Of course, if Texas did decide to partition itself, it might mean 10 Texan senators.</span> The joke is that this will never happen because no one would agree on who gets to keep the Alamo. <br/><br/>This one is believed by some to be a common urban legend. Article IV of the Constitution specifies that Congress must consent to any subdivision of an existing state. In addition, there was no "annexation treaty," just a joint resolution, the same as with every other post-Revolutionary state. As noted below, the organic act by which Congress gave assent to Texas' joining the Union gave it the power to divide itself "without further permission of Congress," which would imply that Congress gave consent for a future split as a part of the original admission. <br/><br/>However, in the Joint Resolution, Congress did allow a provision for the state to divide itself. During the Republican era of Texas and early in its statehood there was a significant political faction known as the 'divisionists' who argued that the former republic was too large to be governed effectively by a single body. The point was rendered moot with the emergence of Texan national culture.
</li><li> Texas then seceded from the USA during the Civil War, though it saw very little action compared to the other Southern states. It did, however, send a relatively large contingent of soldiers for its population size.
</li><li> Texas has, even unto the present day, had fringe secessionist movements, which gained some notoriety after Obama's election and in tandem with the rise of the Tea Party movement.

The United States supported the coup and eventually annexed Hawaii based on trumped-up claims that the Queen's government was oppressing the American immigrants. To this day, the Native Hawaiian community itself is divided over what they want to do about it—some want total independence from the U.S. while others want Hawaii to remain a state but for the Native Hawaiians to have sovereign rights similar to the ones Native Americans have... and there are lots of "in-between" and "none of the above" views mixed in there as well.

The ball got rolling in October 1941, and continued on through November and early December, culminating in men stopping traffic and handing out proclamations of independence. Those who note what date would come up very soon after this period can guess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">how the movement got quashed for the time being</a>.
<ul><li> Stay tuned, however: Tim Draper's proposal for a state of Jefferson, below, is once again under serious consideration due to certain trends in sentiment since the election of 2016.
</li></ul></li></ul><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a></h2>
<ul><li> California's history of independence goes back very far. The area was only settled by the Spaniards in 1769, who remained loyal to the Crown during Mexico's War of Independence. After the war, California was only part of Mexico for fifteen years, during which it rebelled against the Mexican government <em>four times</em> (twice to maintain a locally-based government, twice for outright independence). It was briefly a sovereign nation until U.S. troops moved in and forcibly made it a territory as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericanWar">Mexican-American War</a>. It was mostly a given that it would become a state even before that, though unlike Texas, its limbo was solved much sooner, by the Compromise of 1850. Since the election of 2016, there has been some increase in secessionist sentiment among the locals, along with a rise in reciprocal sentiment from people in other states that maybe this "left coast" enclave should be <em>kicked out</em>.
</li><li> In 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper proposed a "Six Californias" plan that would split the state into six pieces, all splitting along existing county lines.
<ul><li> The northernmost piece would be called <strong>Jefferson</strong> after the historic proposal and would consist of Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama, and Trinity Counties. Its capital would likely be Chico. These counties are mostly rural, and the hypothetical state of Jefferson would have a far lower population density than the other states.
</li><li> South of Jefferson would be <strong>Northern California</strong>, consisting of Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba Counties. Its capital would be the current state capital, Sacramento.
</li><li> Most of North California's southern border would be with <strong>Central California</strong>, the only one of the six proposed states without a Pacific coastline. Comprised of Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare and Tuolumne Counties, with Fresno as its capital, Central California would become the poorest state in the country on a per capita basis.
</li><li> Contrasting this, the <em>richest</em> state in the country per capita, if the Six Californias plan passed, would be <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, just west of Central California. Comprised of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> as its state capital, this state houses the wealthy tech giants of the country. It should be noted that Draper hails from this region of California; as such, some cynics have suggested that this is the <em>real</em> goal of the Six Californias plan, to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright">corporate enclave</a> in the Bay Area where Silicon Valley firms and venture capitalists would be free to write the laws in their favor.
</li><li> South of Silicon Valley and the western part of Central California is <strong>West California</strong>, which would be the most populous of the six new states. Comprised of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, and Ventura Counties, its capital would naturally be Los Angeles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">which, due to its status as the hub of the American entertainment industry, is what most people think of when they think of California anyway.</a> Except for Californians, paradoxically.
</li><li> Finally, the counties of Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego would become <strong>South California</strong>, with San Diego as its capital. South California would be second to West California in population. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Contrary to what the owners of a certain baseball team would have you believe, this would put Anaheim and Los Angeles in separate</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">states</a></em>, as Anaheim is located in Orange County.
</li></ul></li><li> Following the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the California Independence Movement (Calexit) gained some momentum moving from 13% to 32% in terms of support. Supporters like to point out that the State gives more resources to the Federal Government than it takes and is the 6th largest economy in the world if counted separate from the United States. Detractors like to point out that there is no legal succession from the United States and California is the largest solid for the Democratic Party (and in general) and it leaving will mean a larger gap to cover when the next elections come up. (Notably, Trump won the popular vote without California, and the house would lose over 40 Democrats but less than 10 Republicans in such a scenario) Most people see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">little difference between this and when Texas was threatening to leave when Obama was elected 8 years previous</a>.
<ul><li> Another point brought up against this is that California's economic power is rooted in its large ports for trade between the United States and the rest of the Pacific as well as having the rest of the US as a common market for Californian goods.
</li><li> Support for independence plummeted, however, after California National Party leader Louis Marinelli suspiciously emigrated to Russia.
<ul><li> In Alexander Dugin's book "Foundation of Geopolitics", it's suggested that Russia needs to support a secession of California to break global US hegemony. Several internet media related to Dugin, (mainly Katehon and Geopolitica.ru) published articles in support of the Calexit Movement, while at the same time being extremely supportive of Trump and the alt right. This fueled conspiracy theories that Russia was behind Calexit.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>The Northeast</h2>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Constitution#Article_10._Right_of_Revolution">New Hampshire's state constitution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> would seem to suggest not the right to independence, but in fact, the <em>duty</em> to revolt should the government become overly oppressive.
</li><li> Vermont was also an independent nation from 1777 until it joined the Union in 1791. Of course, though Vermont considered itself an independent nation, the rest of the early U.S. just wasn't sure whether it was part of New York or New Hampshire. <br/><br/>Much of northern New Hampshire and a goodly chunk of the Lake Champlain Valley in New York considered themselves and were recognized by Vermont, as part of the Republic of Vermont. Part of the deal when Vermont joined the Union was the abandonment of the claim on this "Greater Vermont". <br/><br/>The Vermonters then turned to the British for recognition during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">War of Independence</a>, but the war started winding down before negotiations really got rolling. Much like Texas, a certain number of Vermonters still cling to the notion that they have the right to secede, and an active secessionist movement there is "committed to the peaceful return of Vermont to its status as an independent republic and more broadly the dissolution of the Union". According to some calculations, Vermont pays more to the Federal government in taxes than it receives back in federal funds.
</li><li> New England was the first region to consider secession from the United States, in the form of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Convention">Hartford Convention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of 1815, which discussed primarily forging a separate peace with Great Britain. Important background: Americans were not unanimously in favor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, despite whatever impressions you may have gotten from your history textbook. While today, textbooks primarily cite the British practice of stopping American merchant ships they suspected were bound for France (who they were at war with at the time) and seizing goods or even kidnapping American sailors, many, especially New England, saw the war as a naked attempt to appropriate the land of Native Americans, many of whom were allied with Britain. New England even traded with Canada and Britain throughout the war in defiance of federal laws, which is the main reason they were spared the bulk of the fighting despite being the only area to border a British territory.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> Mayor Fernando Wood proposed that his city secede from the union during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Civil War</a> and form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone">free-trade zone</a> which would have commerce with everybody. It helped that most working-class New Yorkers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">really despised</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">President Lincoln</a>, especially over the issue of conscription.
</li><li> Also from New York, there have been so many proposals to split the state between its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState">upstate</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">downstate</a> portions that even most New Yorkers have lost count. The divide is a big one — outside the state capital of Albany, most of upstate New York resembles either rural New England or the Rust Belt in its culture and politics, as far a cry from what is <em>the</em> Big City in America as one can imagine.
</li><li> In the spirit of jest, in 1998, the eastern half of Annapolis, Maryland declared itself separate and thus, the Maritime Republic of Eastport was founded. It's all done in fun, to foster a friendly rivalry between the east and west half of a town, separated by Spa Creek and celebrated with an annual tug-of-war.
<ul><li> There is a proposal for the five most North Western counties in Maryland (the Eastern Shore, the region made up mostly of counties that border Delaware) to secede and form either their own state or join with either West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware or some combination thereof. This gained steam in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> after congressional redistricting broke up many of the larger Republican concentrations (which mostly contains the Northernmost counties and Eastern Shore), leading many people to consider the State one of the most gerrymandered in the entire Union. Some parts of a district contain narrow portions that are less than a mile in one direction and connect to larger blobs nowhere near the point of origin.

Currently, this declaration has been in name only.
</li><li> The Arlington area of Virginia is the land originally ceded from Virginia to Washington D.C. when the city was being formed, then seceded/given back to Virginia. The rest of the city is looking to do something similar leaving D.C. to be just the region near the National Mall and some surrounding neighborhoods. Whether the city proper becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica">a 51st State</a> or returns to Maryland is a major point of debate hampering further movement. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13rkmc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13rkmc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13rkmc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Currently, D.C. has one House of Representatives observer who can raise issues, but cannot vote. Almost all D.C. residents are in favor of either option because it will mean representation. The debate is more up to Congress, which must approve, and falls on party lines. D.C. is reliably Democratic, so the Democrats would like to see it as full Statehood giving it two more safe seat Senators. Republicans would prefer it ceded back to Maryland, where it would net only one reliable opposition House Seat.</span>
