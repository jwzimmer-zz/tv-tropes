In other cases, the parent loves and accepts their child and while the child may have difficulty coming to terms with this trope, they are eventually able to do so. If the child's conception is well-known, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">society at large</a> might ostracize the victimized parent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad">their child</a>, or both for being "tainted".

</p><p>A variation is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicalRapeAndImpregnate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicalRapeAndImpregnate">Medical Rape and Impregnate</a>, wherein a woman is made pregnant through non-sexual means without her consent.
</p><p>This trope itself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, and not just in human beings. Scientists have found that in many species, males who cannot attract a willing mate will ambush a female as a last resort. Some species have a depressingly large number of males commit rape as their <em>first</em> resort, usually leading to an evolutionary "arms race" between males and females. Ducks are a classic example of this; if you were wondering why male mallards have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">such enormous cloacas</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vrs2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vrs2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vrs2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The terms "penis" and "vagina" don't apply to bird genitals, and you <em>will</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomewhereAnOrnithologistIsCrying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomewhereAnOrnithologistIsCrying">irritate biologists</a> if you mention a bird having a penis or vagina; for both sexes, it's called the "cloaca" instead</span> it's because female ducks have evolved long, branching cloacas with at least one dead end specifically in order to make forced copulation difficult and unlikely to result in conception. Some biologists have even claimed rape is an evolutionary adaption, though this view isn't accepted by most, and it remains a very controversial idea. In addition, some studies<a class="urllink" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-003-1014-0">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggest that, statistically, rape may have a higher probability to result in pregnancy than consensual intercourse, although why this may be remains unknown.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This was actually viewed as medically <em>impossible</em> for centuries in the West, due to a theory that female and male genitalia were mirror images, thus conception supposedly required ejaculation by both sexes, which they held would only happen if the sex were enjoyed (i.e. was consensual). Biologically there is some truth to this, though the latter is not the case. Obviously the male ejaculation is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">somewhat important factor</a>, but there is evidence that a female orgasm can cause part of the cervix to dip into the part of the vagina where semen would normally pool, thus increasing odds of conception. However, you can see the problem already: the woman's pregnancy was actually a <em>defense</em> to rape charges, since the logic goes Orgasm = Pregnancy = Consent. There is a remnant of the "no pregnancy due to rape" concept still floating around, as Todd Akin's infamous comments on "legitimate rape" made clear in 2012.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xg54');"><sup>specifics </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xg54" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xg54');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 2012, U.S. Congressman Todd Akin made comments related to his opposition to abortion even in cases of pregnancy by rape. "It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare (referring to the commonality of pregnancy from rape). If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">try and shut that whole thing down</a>." Apart from showing a stunning lack of knowledge of basic human biology, the implication was that if a woman became pregnant following a sexual assault, that it was because she somehow willingly overrode this make-believe defense mechanism and therefore shared the fault for her own pregnancy, meaning she should have no reason to seek an abortion because she in some degree "wanted" it. At the time, Akin was in a race for a seat in the Senate where he was leading in the polls by a slight margin; following the comment and its fallout, he lost his Senate election and subsequently retired from politics.</span> Along with this, the idea that an orgasm means it was enjoyed, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">rape must not have occurred</a>. This isn't the case though — orgasm has been documented to occur involuntarily for men <em>and</em> women.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13pmi');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13pmi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13pmi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is an <em>entirely</em> physical response with nothing to do with the emotional state nor the state of mind of those that experience it. With the (for lack of a better phrase) proper physical stimulation, the recipient could no more prevent orgasm from occuring any more than he or she could bring themselves to orgasm without stimulation through sheer force of will.</span>

However, these assumptions have been cast into heavy doubt due to several facts and revelations:
<ul><li> Endeavor's daughter and second oldest child is 22 and turning 23... while he's only 45 turning 46. Given the age gaps between his children, Shoto 15 and Natsuo being 18-19, one can assume his oldest, Toya, is older than his sister by 3-4 years, making Endeavor potentially <em>19-21</em> when he became a parent. Since he'd just be starting his hero career around the same time, Shoto's explanation that he used his fame and wealth to make Rei's family allow their Quirk marriage becomes much more questionable regarding the circumstances, though Endeavor himself notes that he chose her because she could mitigate his Quirk's weaknesses.
</li><li> Furthermore, Toya was Endeavor's first choice as his successor, reinforced by his age making him a high school student and hero in training when Shoto was just getting his Quirk. Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's implied that Toya may have been crippled or killed when Endeavor attempted to teach a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>.

</li><li> Indirectly, the film reveals that All Might spent his early hero years in America. If he and Endeavor are the same age, it's likely that Endeavor was already a father when All Might returned to Japan and thus, the idea of having his children surpass All Might did not occur until this time if not sometime after.

For bonus angst points, he's told that his mother clung to life in the hope that her unborn baby was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">sired by her dead husband</a>, and upon giving birth and discovering otherwise... Some writers later turned it into a lie to cover up a consensual affair between his parents, but others changed it back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, the younger sisters of Balin Brindle are rumored to be actually fathered by him, on his own mothers, as his father is old and frail. The protagonists seem to think this consensual, but there is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> involved if you don't believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>.
<ul><li> Averted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trini</span>, who was raped by her own husband, but didn't get pregnant. The rapist doesn't seem to have fathered any other children, either, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except for an incestuous child with his sister/biological cousin</span>. Having children is also the main reason why women commit rape in this universe — men are so rare that the only three options to conceive a child are a husband (to be shared by all sisters in a family), a male prostitute, or rape. The above-mentioned male rapist, on the other hand, was just a sadist, as he had more than ten wives who were smitten with him.

Donaldson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</a></em>, the titular character rapes and impregnates one of the first people he meets in the Land, then later has to deal with his child as an adult because of the time difference between the Earth and the Land.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepLove">Deep Love</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reina</span> is raped, she gets pregnant and has a child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whom she names Ayu.</span>

<ul><li> Arthur could be considered this as well, since he was conceived under false pretenses; his father (Uther) magically disguised himself as his mother's real husband (Gorlois), who was being killed by Uther's men at the time, the sorcerous equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a>. Ygraine does marry Uther, and according to all sources that comment they were very happy, but she sure wasn't pleased when she worked out what had just happened.

</li><li> The next book has Du Chaillu, who was kept as a slave and raped repeatedly, and has become pregnant. Richard convinces her not to abort the child.
</li><li> Usually the case with Confessors, as the nature of their power means they try to avoid falling in love and having sex with men they love, as they can't avoid Confessing them in the throes of passion, essentially turning them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> slaves. As such, they usually confess "bad" men and use them to father and protect their children. However, as in the case of Kahlen and Dennee Amnell, their mother died when they were little, which caused their father to die of despair as well.
</li></ul></li><li> This is Saavik's backstory in the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>; she's one of several children produced by Romulans raping captured Vulcans. She mentions that she doesn't even know if the rapist was her mother or her father.
<ul><li> This is also a backstory of Soleta, a character prominent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novels. Her story is particularly tragic: her mother desperately wanted a child with her husband, but all of her pregnancies ended prematurely. Then she was raped by a rogue Romulan, became pregnant, and decided to have the child (as a gift of fate). And indeed, Soleta is the only child her mother gives birth to.
</li></ul></li><li> Clovis Holstein in the <em>Warrior Trilogy</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a> novels learned early on in his life that he was the Child by Rape of Duke Aldo Le Strade.

</li><li> <em>Need</em> by Carrie Jones has a character outright using this phrase, though whether it's "really" rape is a matter of a brief debate. The woman consented...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">because she was under heavy threats to herself and her family</a>. And then the disaster that this was supposed to avoid <em>happened anyway</em>. The child is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zara herself.</span>

One of them was conceived when a human woman raped by a <em>troll</em>. In one short story, we're introduced to a Grendelkin, who can only reproduce this way, with the offspring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster">clawing its way out of the poor "mother"</a>.

A <em>very</em> rare case where the perpetrator is actually a sympathetic character, who carried out the rape whilst his anti-psychotic medication was being forcibly withheld by a third party and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">was wracked with guilt</a> when he was lucid again.
</li><li> The title character of Stephen King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em> may have been the result of marital rape, as revealed by her religious fanatic mother Margaret directly before her attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">kill her</a>. Carrie's mother and father, being extremely, puritanically religious, strongly disliked and were repulsed by sex; however Margaret implies that they couldn't resist no matter what and that her father raped her one night when he was drunk, which made Margaret even more ashamed when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">enjoyed it</a>. Margaret then thought that she had "a cancer of the womanly parts" until a doctor told her she was pregnant.
</li><li> Bruce Robertson, the brutal misanthropic policeman in the Irvine Welsh novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Filth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Filth">Filth</a></em> (1998), is revealed to have been conceived after his mother is raped by "The Beast".
</li><li> This happens quite often in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em>, but then again, it's a big series.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce">Memories of Ice</a></em>, the so-called Children of the Dead Seed are the products of women who have gone mad due to cannibalism taking to the battlefield and having their way with the corpses of very recently dead or dying soldiers, based on how the soldiers' bodies would release a last portion of semen upon death. Anaster, in particular, is the product of such a situation and it is heavily implied that he has no soul and becomes a violent cannibal thanks to that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightTides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightTides">Midnight Tides</a></em>, Rud Elalle is the product of his goddess mother raping Udinaas, a human slave, to get at the wyval blood he is temporarily infected with at that time. Since she then drops off her child in a community of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCavemenWereNeanderthals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCavemenWereNeanderthals">Imass</a> to be raised, though, Rud becomes a very friendly, caring youth willing to stand up to his own mother to protect those who raised him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBonehunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBonehunters">The Bonehunters</a></em>, Scillara gives birth to a child which was conceived by rape during the Whirldwind Rebellion. She used to be a prostitute in the Whirlwind Army camp, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>, and she cannot abide to keep the child and leaves it to some villagers to care for.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds">Toll the Hounds</a></em>, Harllo is introduced, who was conceived by a high ranking officer raping Stonny Menackis during the siege of Capustan. She is not beating about the bush concerning her revulsion regarding the child, and Harllo, being five by this point, actually thought for a long time that Rape was his father's name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrippledGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrippledGod">The Crippled God</a></em>, Korlat makes a vague statement about not being a pure-blooded Tiste Andii, and her mother Sandalath's point of view heavily implied that Korlat was conceived by rape. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy">The Kharkanas Trilogy</a></em>, the prequel, confirms that Korlat is the product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalPregnancy">mystical rape</a> resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatThingIsNotMyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatThingIsNotMyChild">That Thing Is Not My Child!</a> from her mother's point of view. Korlat is influenced by this even a millennia later and is not able to face her mother again, despite being a respected figure among the Tiste Andii, because she was unable to prevent her brother's death, whom Sandalath had charged her to protect no matter what as punishment for being a child by rape.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Phenomena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Phenomena">Phenomena</a></em>, Sha-ra's child was born out of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Rape</a>. Apparently, this was one of those times in fiction when a woman raping a man isn't displayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">a humorous situation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> has several examples of this. But, the consensus is pretty much "it's not the incidence of rape that a terrible child makes, but what comes afterwards which can". Raise a child poorly and, well... yeah.
<ul><li> Ramsay Bolton is an interesting examination of the trope, since it's pretty clear that the reason Ramsay is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">awful</a> has less to do with being conceived in a "tainted" situation and more to do with being related to/"raised" by/deliberately neglected by and then suddenly accepted by someone horrible enough to go around raping people in the first place. Perhaps you could have looked into providing a better education and a more stable environment, sooner, Roose — instead of, say, trolling that mill-owning family from a distance with occasional, Reekish-esque, "help", eh?
</li><li> Also, Daenerys Stormborn is probably this. According to Jaime Lannister's recollections, her parents' sex life had devolved to the point that it only happened when her insane father got horny after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burning</a> and violently abused the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">Marital Rape License</a>. However, whatever problems Dany has have rather more to do with "being raised in a form of sheltered exile in frequently terrible circumstances with a terrible brother as a replacement parental figure because we all got a Rebellion to the face mostly thanks to Dad" than how she was likely conceived.
</li><li> Lollys Stokeworth's son was conceived when she was gang-raped during the Riot of Kings' Landing and her husband, Bronn, decides to name the child after his boss, Tyrion (whether or not this was intended as a slight to Tyrion is left ambiguous, though Bronn apparently wanted to name the child <em>Tywin</em> after Tyrion's father until Cersei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction">vetoed it with extreme prejudice</a> — but, that <em>could</em> also have been the warm-up to actually getting "Tyrion": it'd look more acceptable by sheer contrast).
</li><li> Gilly's son is almost definitely a case of this, considering the father of her child is also <em>her own</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">father</a>, Craster. Poor mite didn't ask for that any more than Gilly did. And, he didn't ask <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to be made into a Moses/swapsie story to save somebody else, either. Whatever happens to the kid as a consequence of that, that's on Jon et al. Which could be highly ironic, considering Jon's possible background.</span>
</li><li> Had it not been aborted, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lysa Arryn and Petyr Baelish's</span> child might have been this, since it was the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lysa</span> taking advantage of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Petyr</span> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">passed out drunk and later bedridden with fever</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">to sleep with him while he thought she was someone else</a>. "Might" because it is unclear whether she was intentionally impersonating the woman he actually loved. She appears to believe it was consensual, although she is more than a bit unhinged so that by itself doesn't prove much.
</li><li> Franklyn Flowers claims his mother was a washerwoman who was raped by one of Lord Fossoway's sons. As a result, Franklyn hates the Fossoways despite kind of being one himself (maybe). Well, <em>that</em>, and any time he'd approach one about it, it's gone badly for unspecified reasons. Probably to do with lack of any solid proof combining with him still being a bastard if it is actually true (so his opinion about anything wouldn't count because no status).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirEyesWereWatchingGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirEyesWereWatchingGod">Their Eyes Were Watching God</a>,</em> Janie was conceived when her mother was raped by her schoolteacher. The mother may possibly count as an example herself since her own father is the plantation owner who used to own Nanny.
</li><li> Ushahin Dreamspinner from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSundering">The Sundering</a></em> is the result of the rape of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Ellyl</a> woman by a human man.

Bringing this topic up around half-orcs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">is a good way to get something important broken</a>. 5<sup>th</sup> Edition's Players Handbook largely sets it aside in favour of human-orc marriage alliances, though the Monstrous Manual spends several paragraphs talking about how orcs are bloodthirsty, savage raiders before bringing up the fact that their patron goddess Luthic demands that they mate as often and indiscriminately as possible.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> plays up this trope, something that the game's designers have defended as emphasizing both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> nature of their setting and the innate heroism of half-orc player characters.
