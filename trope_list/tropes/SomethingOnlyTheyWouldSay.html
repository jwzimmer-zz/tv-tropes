Upon awakening and seeing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dio's corpse</span>, his first thought is to play a joke on his grandson, Jotaro, and pretend to be possessed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the vengeful spirit of Dio</span>. Jotaro is ready to punch his face in, but Joseph narrowly avoids being killed a second time by answering questions from Jotaro, such as "Who starred in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TarzanTheApeMan1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TarzanTheApeMan1981">the 1981 remake of Tarzan</a>?"

(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>). As Jotaro puts it, "Only you would know such stupid things."
<ul><li> Earlier in the same arc, Polnareff knows a version of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> sister Sherry is the real deal when she admits she still feels guilty about an incident from when they were younger (she fed his favorite exotic fish to the cat). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doesn't mean she didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeBackWrong">Come Back Wrong</a>, though...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Used as a red herring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jodie is routinely seen using a catch phrase ("A secret makes a woman a woman") belonging to Vermouth, the Black Organization's master of disguise, who bears some resemblance to Jodie. Turns out that Vermouth said the same phrase to Jodie after killing Jodie's parents.</span>
<ul><li> Played with much earlier in the series, in episode 2: Conan reveals he knows about the mole on Agasa's butt to try to convince Agasa he's really Shinichi in a kid's body - but Agasa just assumes Shinichi's been blabbing. Instead, Conan convinces Agasa by doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> to figure out where he's been, proving he's really Shinichi via ability instead of knowledge.
</li><li> Also when Akai Shuuichi is disguised as Okiya Subaru, he says "the blame is fifty-fifty", a common phrase he used, which provides the clue of who Akai was hiding as to Jodie after she realized his death was faked.
</li></ul></li><li> In the end of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>, the Silver King shows up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the body of a high school boy</span>, and before he can worry about how to convince the others in the room that it's really him, the Gold King calls the phones in the room. When Kusanagi answers, the Gold King tells him, "There should be a man standing somewhere near you with a silly look on his face. Put him on the line, will you?" Sure enough, Kusanagi looks up and the Silver King is wearing that exact expression - after not having seen the Gold King for about <em>seventy years</em>, it still holds true.
</li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator">Valvrave the Liberator</a></em>, Haruto has somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySnatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySnatcher">found himself in the body of</a> a Dorssian spy (who we will later come to know as L-elf). After rescuing his friends, Haruto tells them it's really him. How does Kyuma decide to test this? Several rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Haruto loses all of them. "Alright, it's you."
</li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, Yusuke's deceased spirit possesses Kuwabara's body to tell Keiko that he's coming back to life soon, so he needs her to take care of his body. However, Yusuke's been unable to convince anyone else that he's been telling the truth, so instead, he approaches her from behind, suggestively compliments her "Nice skirt!" (a callback to a scene in the first episode where he flipped her skirt) and grabs her breasts. This causes her to slap him across the face while shouting "Yusuke, you jerk!" out of habit, after which she's much more receptive of his claim to be Yusuke in Kuwabara's body. Since that wouldn't fly outside of Adult Swim, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> Toonami version cuts out the boob-grabbing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, Rachel and her associates at the <em>Daily Days</em> figure out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Rail Tracer</a> was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the train conductor, because the Rail Tracer knew Rachel was a stowaway and asked for her ticket.</span>
<ul><li> Later, Claire Stanfield reveals himself to Rachel as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aforementioned rail tracer</span> by making a comment about her ticket purchases.
</li><li> You know how that demon that started the whole thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">is always saying</a> "<em>maa, ii</em>"/"well, no matter"? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You know how that guy Ronnie who works for the Martillos is always saying the same thing?</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, Chibi-Usa knows that a monster disguised as her mother is a fake, because her mother calls her "Small Lady," not "Rabbit," which is the Black Moon clan's name for her. A similar situation occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SailorMoonAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SailorMoonAnotherStory">Sailor Moon: Another Story</a></em> game, where Nergal disguised as Sailor Pluto is given away because she calls Chibi-Usa "Princess," while Sailor Pluto would normally use the same "Small Lady" nickname.
<ul><li> Also in one of the final episodes of <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, Mistress Nine reverts to using Hotaru's regular body to get Moon to give her the Holy Grail (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">"Purity Chalice"</a> in the U.S. TV broadcast version). When Moon finds her among the ruins of the Mugen Academy, she realises the person she is talking to is not Hotaru when the latter calls her by her civilian name, Usagi: the real Hotaru met Moon before but only as Usagi, so Hotaru would <em>never</em> know that Usagi was Sailor Moon.
</li><li> In an earlier episode, as Usagi is being given a ride by Haruka, she recognizes the latter's speech about "people only surviving by trampling on others" as the same words Sailor Uranus spoke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></em> has a great, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narmy</a>, scene, where Sailor Moon exhausts herself trying to protect Tuxedo Kamen and nearly falls down the stairs. Tuxedo Kamen catches her and asks if she's an idiot. SM automatically retorts with "who are you calling an idiot" before realizing their dialogue mirrors the one between her and Mamoru after the latter saved her from being run over by a car. Cue dramatic unmasking.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ano7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ano7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ano7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One-sided, as Mamoru already knew her identity by that point.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> and anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, Archer says and does things occasionally that hint at his true identity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass">future Shirou Emiya</a></span>, most damning of which is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Trace on", the same thing that Shirou always says when he activates his magic.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Edward and Ling are wary of one another since either one could be the impostor Envy. Ling proves himself to Edward by offering to recite, in perfect order, all of the items on the room service menu from the hotel where they were staying. He then starts to press Ed's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> by making a reference to his shortness; when Ed pitches his characteristic tantrum, Ling knows he's the real thing.
<ul><li> Zigzagged when Bido recognizes the second Greed due to his signature speech. While he correctly identifies Greed as a result, Greed himself doesn't recognize Bido <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until after killing him and suffering when his lost memories come back</span>.
</li><li> Later, after Greed's Anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, Ed discovers Ling in the hut they used as a fallback after Mustang's guys, the Elrics, and Ling's party worked together to capture Gluttony (interestingly the last place in the normal world Ling was seen alive, really, since the two of them got to Father's base by way of Gluttony's stomach) and Ling's falling over and asking for food is taken by Ed as a sign that it's really him.
</li><li> Parodied in episode 14 of 4koma Theater:
<div class="indent"><strong>Roy Mustang:</strong> "When we're alone, the Lieutenant calls me cutie pretty lovely lighter!" <em>(gets shot twice)</em>
</div></li><li> The above is a parody of an actual line used between Riza and Envy when they corner him.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, Jerin's sister Blush was outside, and when she returns, cannot remember the password. This causes her to use some colourful curses, so that they already know it can only be her when she finally remembers the password. (They all learned how to curse from their grandmothers. Other families in the area probably don't have quite the same vocabulary...)
</li><li> In <em>Eldest</em>, the 2nd book of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a>, Eragon recognizes the dragon rider in steel armor as his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly dead friend Murtagh</span> when he spins his hand-and-a-half sword at his hip, much like he did when the two of them trained together.
</li><li> "Jane Smith" was identified by her bizarre taunt ("Rub a monkey's tummy! Rub a monkey's tummy with your head!") in the children's book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool">Wayside School</a> Gets a Little Stranger</em>.

However, Harry sees the face of someone he knows in the crowd attacking him. He attempts to disarm him, rather than stun or kill, and the Death Eaters realize that this one is him; Harry, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>, also used Expelliarmus in his battles with them</span>. (In the film, it's Hedwig coming to the rescue which gives him away.)
<ul><li> In the same book, Voldemort <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil">jinxes his own name so that whoever says it is immediately found</a>. The only people brave enough to do that, rather than referring to him by euphemisms or "the Dark Lord", are the ones leading the fight against him.
</li><li> Then there's the passwords the Ministry suggested everyone set to identify impersonators. Mrs. Weasley's password to her husband was her husband's pet name for her - the embarrassing/adorable "Mollywobbles".

</li><li> This was used time after time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em>, because of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">Twin Switches</a> that were going on. In one example, the twins' friends prove which twin is which by asking Jessica to spell thief and asking Elizabeth who a certain soap star is. Jess spells it wrong and Elizabeth doesn't have a clue about the soap star. Somehow, their friends are convinced...
<ul><li> In another book, Enid (Elizabeth's best friend) and Todd (her boyfriend) are convinced that Elizabeth has told another guy everything about them when the guy repeats to them things they told her. When he tries the same thing with Jessica, she calls his bluff and later realizes that he stole Elizabeth's diary.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Stone of Tears</a></em>, the phrase "true as toasted toads" is used to positively identify a messenger as having come from Zedd.
<ul><li> Also subverted in the first book. Richard finds himself under the effects of an "Enemy Web", where people would perceive him as their enemy; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darken Rahl</a> if they're Richard's ally, or as Richard if they were allied with Rahl. Richard sneaks into his brother's tent, gets his attention, and goes to do the the "Loser's Salute," which his brother forced him to do whenever he lost one of their play swordfights as kids, to identify himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But his brother already recognizes him as Richard; this immediately tips Richard off that his brother was really in league with Rahl.</span>
</li><li> A bit later, Zedd recognises Richard despite the Enemy web because she notices his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTics">habit</a> of running a hand through his hair when frustrated.
</li><li> In the last book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after using forbidden magic to save the world from some other forbidden magic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">yeah, that happens a lot in this series</a>), Richard believes that his wife's feelings prevented her from regaining her memories, which she lost as a result of the latter forbidden magic. He realizes she did regain her memories when she says, "You're a rare person, Richard," something she said about him during the first book.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Aragorn quotes to Frodo a bit of poetry that Bilbo wrote about him. Note that Frodo knew the poem not from Bilbo, but because it was in a letter from Gandalf that he (Frodo) was reading right then. Aragorn did not know that the poem was in the letter, although he might have known or suspected that Gandalf would supply Frodo with that line, making it a reasonable thing to drop into the conversation.
<ul><li> In the third book, Sam gives Frodo the password "Elbereth" to lower a ladder in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, reasoning that "No orc would say that".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Body Parts</em> by Michael Bates, the tip off is the way a girl says "difícil" just as the protagonist's friend used to before she went missing. What's it a tip off to? The fact that the girl was sewn together from body parts harvested from local kidnapped teens, including said friend, which (somehow) gives her an unconscious retention of their mannerisms. This is a bit different from usual, as the girl herself doesn't know the identities of her "donors".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarsMyDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarsMyDestination">The Stars My Destination</a></em> by Alfred Bester, Saul Dagenham recognizes a disguised Gully Foyle when he uses a pseudonym that Dagenham had implanted in Foyle's mind back when he first attempted to interrogate him via hypnosis.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy">Kushiel's Mercy</a></em>, even though Sidonie's under the influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> wiping out the memory of her boyfriend Imriel, and Imriel himself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a>, the use of the word "always" when it comes up in conversation always triggers something for them, which they eventually figure out. (Note that "always" is NOT the trigger to unlock Imriel's true personality, but it seems to help the two blend together.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept">Unicorn Point</a></em>, Bane accidentally reveals himself when he speaks a Phaze dialect in place of Mach's Proton-speak.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> there is a Sorceress who likes to possess people. Unfortunately, she often gives herself away by calling people "my pet". Also, the Demoness Metria is described as being easily recognizable, no matter what form she takes, because of her speech impediment (luckily, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">alternate personalities</a> have no such speech problems).
</li><li> Played for laughs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Culture</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matter">Matter</a></em>.

The tutor wearily concludes this is indeed his inept student of old.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">Star Trek: New Frontier</a></em>, "Treason": Si Cwan (a ghost) proves he's possessed his sister by fighting both Xyon and Calhoun (neither slouches in the fight department), beating Xyon and getting beat by Calhoun, but proving himself enough for Calhoun to call him "Cwan, you pompous ass!"
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePathsOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePathsOfTheDead">The Paths of the Dead</a></em>: Tazendra (now a Lavode) is standing guard at Dzur Mountain when Piro and Kytraan arrive to see Sethra Lavode.

When traveling in disguise, Sparhawk sends a messenger to the home of a brother Pandion with the message that he "has brought his little mother for a visit." <em>Little mother</em> is the Pandions' term of endearment for Sephrenia, their tutor in magic. (She happens to be present for the dispatch, and is surprised to learn of the code in her honor.)
</li><li> <em>Little Pet Shop of Horrors</em>, a book in the <em>Bone Chillers</em> series (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FollowTheLeader/Literature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FollowTheLeader/Literature">similar</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em>), is about an evil pet shop that turns children into animals and sells them as pets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonist has a friend who can do somersaults.

The butler asks what the item that is the source of his magical power is, and the character explodes in fury, refusing to reveal it, particularly since he'd never told the butler in the first place. This is the response that the butler was looking for, and he gladly lets him in.

</li><li> In the <em>Franchise/Mistborn</em> books there is a race of intelligent beings called Kandra who can use a persons (or animals) bones in order to perfectly imitate that person's appearance. They gain none of their memories, but will typically observe or interrogate the person before taking over in order to more effectively imitate them. Determining who has been killed and replaced with a Kandra is a major plot point in several books in the series.

They realize that they <em>cannot</em> use something she would normally say because Kilgrave could get her to act like herself, so they decide it would have to be something she would <em>never</em> say. Jessica decides to use the phrase "I love you", which turns out to be particularly handy at the episode's climax.

When Murchoch later reviews the transcript of an old trial he discovers that the key witness in that trial also used the word "huckleberry" to describe people she did not like. He quickly discovers that the two witnesses were actually the same woman who was paid by an unscrupulous prosecutor to assume fake identities and act as a prosecution witness so the prosecutor could win more cases.

A man volunteers for a mission to be turned into an alien-like creature, climb inside a fake UFO and launch an "attack" against the earth. (All this as part of a plan by a shadowy organization to bring about world peace by uniting humanity against an external threat.) The plan goes awry however, when the "UFO" crashes and the grotesque "alien" is shot by hunters. The man's pregnant wife (who knows nothing about the mission) arrives on the crash scene and doesn't recognize the ship's alien-looking occupant as her husband—until he does a special pointing gesture that has special meaning for the two of them, just before he dies of his wounds.

<ul><li> In "Crystal Skull", Daniel Jackson is shifted into another dimension that makes him invisible to everyone but his grandfather, who unfortunately is known to be slightly insane. Daniel instructs his grandfather to repeat some things after him to convince his team that he is standing right there with them. When a skeptical Jack responds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">the usual way</a>, Daniel frustratedly mutters "Jack, don't be an ass", which of course grandpa repeats word for word. Jack is taken aback and after a second he replies, "Daniel?"
</li><li> The situation is reversed in "Fragile Balance", where an infuriated "Daniel!" from a considerably younger version of Jack is taken as confirmation of his identity by Daniel (the two characters usually adopt a particular tone when speaking to each other). The actor who played Young Jack should have gotten an award for the brilliant job he did of mimicking O'Neill's mannerisms and speech patterns.
</li><li> The trope is lightly mocked in the episode "Spirits", where they encounter shapeshifting aliens:
<div class="indent"><strong>Daniel:</strong> Jack. Are you you? <br/><strong>O'Neill:</strong> Yes. Are you? <br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> What? <br/><strong>O'Neill:</strong> Never mind.
</div></li><li> And again:
<div class="indent"><strong>Daniel:</strong> Don't shoot! Just let them tend to Xe'ls. <br/><strong>Jack:</strong> How do I know you're the real Daniel? <br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> ...because. <br/><strong>Jack:</strong> ... Yeah, okay. <em>[lowers gun]</em>
</div></li><li> The second season episode "Holiday" also has a large dose of this. For example, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Jack</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Teal'c</a> have switched bodies:

</div></li><li> "Urgo" has a similar case as "Crystal Skull" above: Everyone in SG-1 has brain implants inserted in them on an alien planet which end up manifesting the titular Urgo, a person only they can see and hear. At the end of the episode they return to the planet and explain the situation to Togar who did this in the first place to get the implants removed. However, there is a problem: The implants will cease to function outside of a host brain, effectively killing Urgo, whose existence was an unintended side effect in the first place. The situation is solved when they convince Togar to take one of the implants himself. But with the implants removed, SG-1 can no longer see or hear Urgo, so how do they know he really survived?
<div class="indent"><strong>Daniel:</strong> Wait, Togar, how do we know that Urgo's really alive? <br/><strong>Urgo:</strong> I'm here, I'm here, tell them, tell them! <br/><strong>Togar:</strong> I will as soon as you are quiet! <br/><strong>Daniel &amp; Jack:</strong> He's alive.

It kicked off in episode 9 with one of the crew being allowed to visit her girlfriend/lover back on Earth, but doing so in the guise of a totally different body. Asked if it was really her, the [blue eyed, Anglo] stranger replied in fluent Cantonese "Have you thrown away that ugly red chair yet?", which satisfied her lover as to her identity.

Bartlet has a one-on-one meeting with one of the refugees who can speak English and begins by asking him to list the Apostles; the refugee answers correctly but points out that being a Christian wasn't about memorizing historical figures but rather that "faith was the true shibboleth". Bartlet, himself a devout Catholic and who had previously used that same expression, determines from that response that they were truly Christians and arranges a way for them to remain in the United States <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by having the California National Guard, who was guarding them to this point, stand down and allow the refugees to escape custody — this would both let the refugees go free while also give the Chinese government a face-saving excuse to avoid jeopardizing the upcoming trade talks</span>.

When Francine realizes Stan duped her, she pulls out his gun and holds up both of them, threatening to shoot out Stan's kneecaps, but quickly finding it impossible to tell which is Stan and which is Bill when they get into a brief scuffle and the flowers on their otherwise-identical suits fall off. One promptly steps forward to give a heartfelt apology and promise that he truly loves Francine - which convinces her that he's Bill, because the real Stan would never say something that sweet. She promptly shoots the other one's knee - only for it to turn out it really <em>was</em> Stan and she just crippled Bill.

<ul><li> "And Then There Were Fewer", the season opener, is a murder mystery that ends with Lois held at gunpoint by the killer, news reporter Diane Simmons. Peter walks in, completely oblivious as to what's going on, asking his wife where his Hot Wheels firetruck is. Lois, looking to tip Peter off by acting unconventionally, but not enough to tip off Simmons, refers to her husband as "Pete', something she's never done in their 20 years of marriage. Peter, being Peter, misses this completely.
</li><li> "German Guy" features a man calling himself "Franz Gutentag" posing as a puppeteer who turns out to be a former Nazi concentration camp official actually named Franz Schlechtnacht. Upon being discovered, Franz leads Peter and Chris to his basement to murder them. Chris takes the gun from Franz, but inexplicably faced with the dilemma as to whether or not he should shoot his father or Franz, questioning which one is his "real father", despite the fact that Peter and Franz look nothing alike. As a test, Chris asks them when is his birthday; when Peter (Chris' own father!) fails to give the correct answer but Franz does not, Chris shoots Peter, causing Franz to reclaim the gun retake the two as hostages.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em>, Foster's Home is overrun with copies of Bloo after all of Mac's classmates thought Bloo was cool (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">Mandy</a>, oddly enough), thought up their own clones of them and donated them <em>en masse</em> to Foster's. Mac, however, wants to take Bloo to see the Ice Charades, but now he has to find the right one. A lot of them are easy to tell apart ("too tall, too short, too skinny, too aqua..."), but it comes down to two of them, and Mac goes through an entire Q and A with them before finally just saying "Alright, say something that proves you're the real Bloo." Bloo 1 gives an emotional, heartfelt speech about all the good times they had together. Mac notes it's something the real Bloo <em>wouldn't</em> say, and correctly deduces the real Bloo is the other one. And then every other Bloo clone ends up participating in the Ice Charades, leading Bloo to complain that Mac got the choice right as they watch it.
</li><li> Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Murder on the Planet Express", where Fry and Bender are trapped on a spaceship with a shapeshifting alien that disguises itself as someone familiar to the target to get close enough to eat them, so Fry and Bender question each other to determine if one of them is the shapeshifter—but neither can think of a good enough question.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fry:</strong> On your last birthday, what gift did I give you? <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> I don't remember. <br/><strong>Fry:</strong> Me neither. <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> Alright, I'll ask you one.

The impostor says nothing, but the real Binky immediately responds with "I'll have a ham on rye, hold the mayo!" As the impostor is taken away by the police, Garfield comments that the real Binky could never resist an old joke like that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eliza Maza identifies Talon as her transformed brother Derek when he automatically answers her "cross my heart" with "hope to die", complete with the particular series of gestures the two of them customarily use with the phrase.
</li><li> Again in <em>Gargoyles</em>, when Goliath is kidnapped by a shape shifter. When Elisa comes to save him, the shifter naturally takes her form. Since he and Elisa have been having trust issues the whole episode, Goliath tries to identify the real Eliza by shouting "Tell me the truth! Did you ever doubt me, even for a moment?" when Elisa sweetly replies, "Never!" Goliath knows that's the fake and tells his Minotaur cop-friend to shoot.
</li></ul></li><li> A variant of this trope appears in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>. Goofy and a double, who is a criminal, are in the same room, which Goofy had been wallpapering. Max identifies his father by leaving an open can of wallpaper glue in the middle of the floor and asking his dad to step forward. Both of them step forward, but only the real Goofy steps in the glue.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeekerArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeekerArchetype">Dipper</a> and his friends are about to go into a secret bunker they discovered, he tells them that they have to keep whatever they find a secret; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl">Wendy</a> responds by making a zipping motion on her lips (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">like she did back in "The Inconveniencing"</a>).

Dipper yells for the real Wendy to give him a sign that it's her; one of them winks, but the other makes the zipping motion, giving Dipper the clue he needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> has "Something Only They Can Do" variant in the episode "Prisoner of Sinestro". The titular prisoner is an alien assassin with the power to possess bodies, which he uses to try and off the Interceptor crew one by one. Later on, Hal realizes that the alien can't use their lantern rings since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield">they can detect if it's really them or not</a>, at which point Sinestro proceeds to purge the ship of oxygen so that the possessed lantern would be unable to survive without the help of their ring and the assassin would be forced to go back to his original body in his cell, the only room in the ship with Oxygen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or so Sinestro claims</span>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>, Gadget and an imposter disguised as him storm into an awards ceremony being held by the Chief and many other police officers. Both try to convince the Chief that the other is the imposter, and the real Gadget, while doing so, accidentally clobbers the Chief over the head with one of his gadgets. The Chief groans, and tells the officers to arrest the other one, saying that the one who hurt him is <em>obviously</em> the real Gadget.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em> episode "Heavy Mettle", Iron Man confronts Stane in the beginning of the episode telling him that he is done with his corruption and "manufactured evil." Later, Tony presents evidence to the Stark International Board that Stane made a deal with Ghost to get the designs for Iron Man's armor and Stane is fired. Before he is thrown out, Tony tells Stane that he and his "manufactured evil" are finished. This causes Stane, who was already growing suspicious of Tony, to realize that Tony Stark is Iron Man.
</li><li> Done at least twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>. The first time, Jackie is split into an overly nice half and an asshole half, and when asked which is the evil one, Nice-Jackie dissolves into tears and proclaims that <em>he</em> must be the evil one because he accidentally stepped on a bug. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance">aside glances</a>.
<ul><li> The second time played it a little straighter with normal-Jackie fighting an evil clone. The good guys want to help but can't tell them apart. Captain Black asks them when his birthday is, and is dismayed when neither of them know the answer. Jade figures it out pretty quickly.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jade:</strong> Hey Jackie, will you take me to Moose World this weekend? <br/><strong>Clone Jackie:</strong> Of course- <br/><strong>Real Jackie:</strong> -not. You have homework. <br/><strong>Jade:</strong> <em>(disappointed)</em> There's your clone.
</div></li><li> The entire episode had a lot of this since each member of the J Team had an evil clone. Jade recognized that the Paco they had was a clone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpostorForgotOneDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpostorForgotOneDetail">when he pronounced her name correctly</a>; Paco pronounces her name as "Yade", due to Spanish being his primary language.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em>, Mr. Black and Mr. White make a robot clone of Johnny, and the others can't figure out which is the fake. Dukey figures it out when fake Johnny answers a math question very fast, since the real one always counts numbers with his fingers.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> cartoon episode "Doppleganger", Ganon kidnaps Zelda after using a magic mirror to create a dark-clothed evil Zelda clone to replace her. Late in the episode, the real Zelda has freed herself and both versions end up covered in mud to the point where it's impossible to tell them apart. Link proposes a kissing contest to identify the fake. He rates the first Zelda's kiss as "very good," but gets a smack in the face instead of a kiss from the second ("<em>*sigh*</em> That's my Zelda all right.")
</li><li> In the <em>Marvel's Rocket &amp; Groot</em> short, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqic68HrLto">"Shapeshifter",<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which Groot and Rocket chase a bounty who changes himself to look like Rocket. Groot uses this method to deduce who's the real Rocket:
<div class="indent"><strong>Left!Rocket:</strong> (calmly) I'm the real Rocket. Look, I know I don't tell you enough, but we've been through a lot. And I would never face the galaxy without you by my side. <br/>(Groot is flattered and gestures to the Rocket on his right to speak his piece.) <br/><strong>Right!Rocket:</strong> (clears throat) <strong>YOU WOOD-FOR-BRAINS WASTE OF SPACE! I'M GONNA BUST YOUR BRANCHES IF YOU DON'T GET ME OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW!!!</strong>
</div><ul><li> Of course, the outburst from the second Rocket is what tips Groot off.

Later, when Sharon's watching Static's latest interview on the news, he uses the same phrase...and she realizes that no one else has ever used that slang before.

Spidey turns to his SHIELD team for help, who still think he's Loki, until Nova gets close enough to him to smell him.

Yugo accused his brother Adamai of being a shapeshifter in disguise when the latter, convinced by Madame Shroud's words that to use them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to rescue Sadlygrove, who had realised his power as the mortal incarnation of the god Iop, from dying at Ogrest's hands</span> would result in the destruction of the world, refused to hand over one of the Dofus eggs to the former. Adamai was offended at the notion, and confirmed his identity by telling Yugo about the birthday gift they'd gotten for Alibert (Yugo's adoptive father), and about how Az (Yugo's pet Tofu and life-long friend) had recently begotten chicks.

</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The entire concept of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shibboleth">shibboleth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a way of identifying someone as an ally as described in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Book of Judges</a>: where captured Ephraimites are betrayed by the fact that they can't pronunce the "sh" phoneme and would say "sibboleth" instead, is based around this. These days, shibboleths are call-and-response; a belligerent in a war will have a certain phrase and counter-phrase. If an approaching battalion gets the phrase wrong, they're the enemy. If the guard gets the counter-phrase wrong, the outpost is under enemy control. Notable examples include:
<ul><li> During the invasion of Normandy, the Americans would open with "Flash," counter with "Thunder," and confirm with "Welcome." This hinges on the fact that a German would pronounce it "Velcome," and caused problems for some German paratroopers that defected, as well as some German- and Yiddish-speaking Jews who had fled German rule and joined the US Army.
</li><li> A British variant in the invasion summer of 1940 would have been, for the same reasons, constructed like <em>Weymouth War Weapons Week</em>
</li><li> American POWs in Vietnam communicated by tapping Morse code on their cell walls. One would initiate a conversation by tapping the familiar "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaveAndAHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaveAndAHaircut">Shave And A Haircut</a>" pattern, and the other would finish with "two bits". If the respondent instead repeated "shave and a haircut", it meant he was a Vietnamese agent.
</li><li> When Americans were being evacuated from Saigon, American newsman Ken Kashiwahara was afraid of being mistaken as Vietnamese and left behind, so he planned to say "I'm from Los Angeles, and the Dodgers won the pennant" if that happened (it didn't).
</li><li> English rioters during the Peasants' Revolt went around looking for Flemish weavers to beat up, identifying them by demanding people say "bread and cheese", which the Flemings did with a distinctive accent.
</li><li> About eighty years previously, the Flemish used "Schild en Vriend" (shield and friend), which the French who they were revolting against could not pronounce, making it Scilt, so the Flemish knew who to butcher.
</li><li> Sectarian fighters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland">Northern Ireland</a> can supposedly identify whether someone is a Catholic or a Protestant depending on how they pronounce the letter H (Protestants would call it <em>aitch</em> while Catholics would call it <em>haich</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Shibboleths need not be confined to wartime or otherwise violent situations. A lot of Swiss people have a habit of making any and all foreigners say 'Chochichäschtli' (a small kitchen cupboard). Not only is it rather difficult to get all these 'ch' sounds right, even if people do, they usually have trouble pronouncing the vowels the correct way. However, if someone is Welsh or Scottish, they usually manage pretty well.
</li><li> If you're in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> and don't want to be identified as a tourist, don't pronounce Houston Street like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Houston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Houston">the city in Texas</a>. Pronounce it like "HOUSE-ten" - the street name is a corruption of William Houstoun, who represented Georgia at both the Continental Congress and the US Constitutional Convention (the street used to be part of his father-in-law's estate).
<ul><li> Similarly, natives of Austin, Texas can usually tell if someone is new to the city (or a tourist) by how they pronounce Manchaca <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4icp0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4icp0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4icp0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two syllables - "Man-SHACK"</span> Road.
</li><li> It's easy to tell who has spent some time in the state of Hawaii in both verbal and written ways. When it comes to the written form, it's people who are diligent about including the ʻokina in applicable words, given that the ʻokina is considered part of the Hawaiian alphabet, meaning that its proper spelling is not how it was spelled moments ago, but rather "Hawaiʻi". Verbally, they account for the pause the ʻokina represents (similar to the way "tt" is pronounced in a Brooklyn or Cockney pronunciation of the word "bottle"), and they pronounce Ws as Vs in Hawaiian words. So, where the normal person would say "huh-WY", the native or longtime resident would say "ha-VY-ee".
</li><li> A few examples from the Pacific Northwest: Oregon (locals pronounce it "OR-uh-gun", not "OR-uh-gone"), Willamette ("wa-LAM-et"), and Couch Street ("Cooch Street"). Pronouncing any of those wrong is a dead giveaway that you're not a local.
</li></ul></li><li> FBI turncoat Robert Hanssen was caught this way. After several US agents had been captured and executed by the Soviets, the Bureau knew they had a mole on their hands. No one suspected Hanssen, however. He was even tasked with finding the leaks for a time. Eventually a communique between Hanssen and his handlers was intercepted, but there was no way to tell who the mole was —until an agent recognized a racial slur the mole made as something only Hanssen would say.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5be3p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5be3p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5be3p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The slur in question was "purple-pissing Japanese", if you're wondering.</span>
</li><li> Former dictator of the Dominican Republic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Rafael Trujillo</a> decided that he didn't want any Haitians in his country (the Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of Hispaniola). So, he had his agents show parsley to people near the border and ask them what it was. The Spanish speaking Dominicans would be able to pronounce the Spanish word 'perejil' ('parsley') properly, while French speaking Haitians would not. Those who couldn't were usually killed and it's estimated that there were between 20,000 and 30,000 deaths in the "Parsley Massacre".
</li><li> A Finnish shibboleth during the WWII was <em>Höyryjyrä</em> (literally "steamroller"). The voiced 'h', frontal 'ö' and 'ä' phonems, labial 'y' and rolling 'r' are almost impossible for anyone except native Finn to pronounce.
<ul><li> Likewise, the name of the town of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyv&lt;!--C3--&gt;A4skyl&lt;!--C3--&gt;A4">Jyväskylä<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> would be nigh impossible for anyone but a native Finn to pronounce.
</li></ul></li><li> And one test for used by Americans during WWII to tell if someone was a Japanese spy was to ask them to say the word 'Lollapalooza'. The trouble native Japanese have with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage">the letter L</a> was used to good advantage.
</li><li> An Australian accent can be difficult to reproduce without practise, so if you really wanted to know if someone is from Down Under, asking them a simple question, like to say 'How are you going' can often reveal them, as they will most like say something along the lines of 'How ya garn'. And if you ever ran into someone with a great fake Aussie accent, getting a genuine Aussie to check the slang (even small ones like mate, arvo (afternoon) servo (service station) or other slang words) they use.
</li><li> Ted Kaczynski was exposed as the Unabomber by his brother David when the latter read the Unabomber Manifesto and found not only similar themes to an essay Ted wrote in college but also the sentence "You can't eat your cake and have it, too" as opposed to the usual idiom "You can't have your cake and eat it too". David had only ever heard that alternate phrasing used by Ted and his mother.
</li><li> Want to know if someone's from Chicago? Just ask them if it's <a class="urllink" href="http://interactive.wbez.org/curiouscity/accents/">"Too haht for hackey."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> If you are in a social network and you suspect that a user is Spaniard or Latin American and they are pretending to be from another country, call them "Spanish", if they answer back with "I am not Spanish", they will prove that they are, in fact, Hispanic. Few Hispanics or Latinos know that the demonym for those born in Spain is "Spaniard" and not "Spanish".
</li><li> Before he died, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a> promised his wife that he would try to contact her from beyond the grave and set up a secret phrase he would say to verify his identity and counteract frauds. His wife held yearly seances after his death but none of them produced the secret phrase.
