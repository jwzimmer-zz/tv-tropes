</div></div><p>This is the love interest's love interest; the person brought in, either for an episode or an arc, to date the one that the main character (or just a character) is in love with. The smitten character will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">jealous</a>, take an instant dislike to him (often being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">blind to what attractions he does have</a>), and do whatever they can to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSabotage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSabotage">sabotage the budding relationship</a>. Usually, the character is either an alpha-dog <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> or a bland, boring milquetoast. They may also be the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> to really inspire the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> to take hold.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This is a hard character to successfully pull off, probably because they usually start out more as a plot device than a character. In many cases, they exist solely to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight">tension and keep the lovers apart</a>, so there's a real risk that your Romantic False Lead, rather than proving a worthy rival to the main character's romantic interests, will simply end up being a rather flat, boring character who just seems to show up and occupy space between the two romantic leads. As a result, this can often risk the show falling into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>. Furthermore, except in rare cases the False Lead is unlikely to generate the same loyalty or sympathy as the main character, meaning that your audience is liable to just spend the time the False Lead's around loudly wishing for him or her to just go away (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">and possibly die</a>) already so the two characters they're interested in seeing together can actually get together.

If the false lead is too likable, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">jealous character</a> will seem like a selfish jerk who cares more about winning their beloved for themselves than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">seeing them happy</a> — or alternatively, since 'perfect' tends to equal 'uninteresting' in the minds of many when it comes to fictional characters, a <em>too</em> perfect and nice character will just lose the audience's interest in comparison to the more flawed and interesting main character. On the other hand, if he's too unlikeable, we'll wonder what the love interest could possibly see in them and lose respect for them. And in extremely rare occasions, the Romantic False Lead might be more interesting and likeable than both main characters together, making the audience wonder why we're not getting a better story about <em>this</em> person instead.

</p><p>Sometimes to up the angst, the writer will go so far as to marry the love interest to the false lead. If this happens, expect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> to have a tawdry affair.

She gives up on him and soon the series focuses on a love triangle between her, Zen, and Taiga.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> introduces Kuranosuke Takeda, a wealthy young nobleman who proposes marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Sango</a>. Atypically and in something of a subversion, Sango's canon love interest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Miroku</a> refrains conspicuously from protesting or interfering, taking instead a firm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a> approach and leaving the decision entirely in Sango's hands, since Kuranosuke can potentially give her the peaceful life that she badly needs; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Kagome</a> is the one that gets riled up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunaiNoSeinen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunaiNoSeinen">...Junai no Seinen</a></em>, Ian comes to Japan hoping to get together again with his ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">sex friend</a> Kaoru. Daigo, Kaoru's lover, thinks that Ian is the Romantic False Lead, as does Ian himself, but it turns out he's actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a> and never stood a chance. Kaoru is just invoking the trope to make Daigo jealous for his own reassurance.
</li><li> Kurumi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke">Kimi ni Todoke</a></em> tries to win Kazehaya's affections, but her plan backfires because he simply doesn't like her. Her attempt does bring Sawako to confront her true feelings for Kazehaya, though. Ultimately, Kurumi fails to be a true false lead but achieves the same result.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sakura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">close friendship</a> with Naruto, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeParentLikeSpouse">Like Parent, Like Spouse</a> implications, and his one-sided crush on her were a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> to keep the true romance between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Naruto and Hinata</a>, which had been planned since the early stages of the manga, as a surprise. In a later interview, he revealed that Sakura was <em>never</em> intended to be Naruto's main love interest, while Hinata <em>always</em> was, and that Naruto and Sakura were always going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">teammates</a>, because he <em>never</em> thought about making them a couple</span>.

But despite the fact that he is a good guy (and a freakin' <em>astronaut</em>!) he is just helping get in the way of Spider-Man's love web. Of course, in the COMICS, John Jameson actually has superpowers (which turn him into a wolf and make him go BERSERK) and Spider-Man has fought and subdued him several times. It's likely he was planned to be a villain in one of the future movies that will probably never be made now.

She's more accepting of Martin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">distinctive personality</a>, a fellow doctor, and similarly unimpressed with most of humankind.

<ul><li> In Series 2, Mickey Smith was reintroduced as an ongoing companion, seemingly putting the rapidly developing relationship between the Doctor and Rose into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnchoredShip">Anchored Ship</a> territory (and indeed Mickey's first full episode as a companion, "The Girl in the Fireplace", placed the Doctor in a new, albeit temporary, romance). This ended up being a false lead as two episodes later, Mickey had left the TARDIS and the Doctor and Rose's relationship continued to deepen to the point where, at the end of the season, Rose became the first companion to zigzag around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheILoveYouStigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheILoveYouStigma">The "I Love You" Stigma</a>.
</li><li> Averted in Series 5.

When Rory <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is erased from history</span>, he appears to fit the trope (even though the episodes that immediately follow contain no substantial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between the Doctor and Amy). Ultimately, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only is Rory revived, he goes on to marry Amy <em>and</em> become the Doctor's father-in-law over time</span>, permanently averting the trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, both Atherton Wing and Tracey Smith are featured in episodes purely to further romantic tension between Mal and Inara and Kaylee and Simon respectively. Both were found wanting. Another romantic false lead fell on the opposite spectrum of this trope and was written to seem more suitable than Inara for Mal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper">predictable results</a></span>.

Although he quickly makes friends with Eddie after waking up, it becomes increasingly clear that he and Iris still have feelings for each other and that she may have never seen him as more than an acquaintance if they hadn't worked to take care of Barry. Eddie breaks up with her because of this, although he ultimately reconciles with her—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">right before Barry tries to go back in time to save his mother, which would negate the timeline where Eddie and Iris met.</a> And even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barry changes his mind and comes back, Eddie has to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save him from Eobard Thawne.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>:
<ul><li> Donny and Mel, along with several other less significant figures in the long course of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a> storyline. These last two were fully fleshed-out characters (Niles even married Mel). Donny, however, had certain character traits that were very off-putting (and were exaggerated in his few later appearances after Niles and Daphne got together): being a stocky, swarthy, loud-mouthed Jewish lawyer obviously far too old for Daphne doesn't exactly help to build realism.
</li><li> Niles was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a> for Daphne, as he was married, and she didn't consider him her type. The subplot became so popular that the writers began slowly nudging the characters toward a real relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season one, Rachel dated muscle-bound Italian Paolo (who was formerly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for this very page) while Ross looked on jealously. The writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> Paolo's role by having Chandler's mother, a romance novelist, refer to Paolo as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper">"a complication you eventually kill off."</a> In the second season, Ross dated academic Julie while Rachel looked on jealously. Since Paolo was a slow-witted pig who could barely communicate with Rachel while Julie was a sweet and lovely person, the writers hit one trap then the other. According to the nature of the Ross-Rachel relationship, pretty much every person either one of them dated for more than an episode after that point had elements of the false lead.
</li><li> Ross' English girlfriend Emily at least seemed to be a generally likable false lead, and Rachel's last minute "I HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW I FEEL" seemed exceptionally selfish and petty (a passenger played by Hugh Laurie calls her out on it too). While she does indeed decide against telling Ross she still loves him and simply wishes him a happy marriage, Ross accidentally says <em>her</em> name when he's up on the altar, showing that he at least has some feelings for her. Later when Ross tries to reconcile with Emily, she too is turned into a selfish, petty shrew by forcing Ross to never see Rachel again and, when she can't have her way, turning her back on him.
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> <em>Ross</em> turned out to be the false lead for Charlie and Greg Kinnear's character. The part where he confesses his love and Charlie runs off with him plays like the end of a romantic comedy - except we weren't following the couple's love story, we were following her love story with the <em>other</em> guy (Ross). It's actually pretty hilarious watching Ross' face when he realises he's the false lead and not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>.
</li><li> In series 5, Rachel inadvertently creates one for Chandler and Monica. Their relationship is secret and they're just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">Friends with Benefits</a>... until Rachel sets up Monica with a very handsome male nurse called Dan, devastating Chandler. Dan's out of the picture by the end of the episode, but his role was to make Chandler and Monica face the realisation that their "goofing around" has taken them well beyond the friendship stage.
</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Richard</a> in the Season 6 finale when he and Chandler both propose to Monica. Although he had been a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> in the past, by this stage Monica and Chandler were blissfully happy, clearly meant for each other and the <em>last</em> season finale had Monica promising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest">Chandler</a> he, and not Richard, was the love of her life and she loved him more than anyone else before. Richard's appearance was clearly a (well-written) ploy to create drama and miscommunication. In fact, Monica didn't just choose Chandler over Richard, but when his proposal plans were ruined, staged her own proposal and asked <em>him</em> to marry <em>her</em>.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> The big one here in the Will/Emma romance, and that's Terri. Her only purpose on the show really was to keep Emma and Will apart. And it took almost all of the first season for Will to get rid of her, too.
</li><li> Jesse plays with this, as it looked like he was around mainly to disrupt the Finn/Rachel pairing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, the untimely death of Finn's actor meant that he got the girl in the end.</span>
</li><li> Quinn was this for Finn and Rachel, and Finn and Sam were sort of this for Quinn and Puck. Artie was also this for Santana and Brittany.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Good Morning, Miami</em> is what happens when a major character is this. Predictably enough with characters who get fleshed out and given a lot of screen time, the writers fell into the "too likable" trap. The main character came across as a girlfriend-stealing asshole and the love interest came off as a bitch who didn't appreciate what she already had.
</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> openly admitted that anyone Blair or Chuck dates other than each other is nothing but a Romantic False Lead. This includes a prince whom Blair actually marries as well as both Nate and Dan (the other two male leads).
</li><li> <em>The Guardian</em> had a false lead in the form of Brian, Lulu's fiancé. Atypically for this trope, Nick had the chance to seriously undermine his rival (he knew about Brian's infidelity) but didn't take it. He did try to persuade Lulu to choose him over Brian, but she went through with the marriage... and inevitably realized it had been a mistake.
</li><li> When Jack and Martha split up on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em>, Martha had four boyfriends, Jack had one girlfriend (later wife), and all were obvious false leads. Jack's wife was sympathetic until her jealousy of Martha and some derailment turned her into a homicidal maniac. Martha's first boyfriend after their separation was an old friend of Jack who kept from her that he was married with children and wasn't prepared to get divorced any time soon. Her second was a much older sleaze bag who recruited her as a pole dancer. The latter two were much more popular, and even some Jack and Martha shippers would have been happier to see them actually move on than draw out the "off-again" stage any longer.
</li><li> Mark Warner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>, married to Stacy, House's ex. Follows the trope exactly, right up to the tawdry affair. It especially sucks for House because Mark develops paralysis of his legs and Stacy stays with her husband, where, five years ago, House lost the use of only one leg, and Stacy left him. And while Mark is, by all accounts, a decent, dedicated husband, and House is really, really <em>not</em>.
</li><li> Piper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> was introduced into the show after Amber and Alfie had broken up. Alfie ended up developing feelings for her that she reciprocated, and their close friendship made Amber start to get jealous and realize just how much she cared for Alfie. Then, Piper decided to go back to her own academy, leaving Alfie without ever forming an actual relationship with him. Amber and Alfie would get back together at the end of the season. Piper was rather sweet to him and he loved her due to her kindness, making her an example of a genuinely nice false lead who just didn't get to stick around due to her personal character arc (and contracts, as she was just a guest, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingUseOfTheTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingUseOfTheTwin">Jade Ramsey's twin, Nikita, as Patricia's twin</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> Being a story Ted Mosby is telling his kids about how he met his one true love, has plenty of these and every girl he meets is (however briefly) teased at potentially being the "mother." This was done as soon as the first episode, being about Ted falling HARD for a girl and the episode ends with the narrator saying "And that is how I met your Aunt Robin." Ted and Robin are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Teased</a> for most of the first season (including some false leads for each other like Derek with Robin and Victoria for Ted) and when they get together they really do love each other, but there are constant hints that they had some fundamental issues that will prevent them from staying together.
</li><li> Both main character Ted and Tony (who was described as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> until he came on-screen) fulfilled this trope with Stella. Ted is originally shown as the right guy for Stella, until the wedding day, when both her and Tony's true feelings are shown. Subverted not only in that Stella leaves Ted, but by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that says she isn't the titular mother (who is the only woman Ted marries).
</li><li> In later seasons, Quinn. Unless the writers plan to crush the dreams of most of the fans, it's just not going to work out between her and Barney. The finale of season 7 revealed Barney's bride to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Robin</span>. As of season 8, Ted is now dating Victoria <em>again</em> after she and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiancee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableFiancee">Klaus</a> have broken up.

</li><li> Brad doesn't even date Sam, but is basically a false romantic lead, because the entire plot of "iOMG" revolves around Carly and Freddie believing that Sam likes Brad.
</li></ul></li><li> Major Lilywhite in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em> initially <em>appears</em> to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> — he's introduced as Liv's blandly "perfect" fiance, who she dumps immediately after becoming a zombie.

However, whilst suffering through some definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> with each other, Jonathan and Carla never actually fooled around with each other, and Brendan was characterized as being an essentially decent and likable man (if rather shallow and slightly foolish and oblivious) who seemed to genuinely care for Carla.
</li><li> Hilariously subverted in one episode with a bloke who <em>thinks</em> he's this between Jonathan and Maddie, except Maddie was only using him to enact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy">Operation: Jealousy</a>. And what's more, thanks to the fact that the photo he provided the dating site was at least ten years out of date and he's got the personality of "the bastard son of Forrest Gump", it's a hilariously backfiring subversion for Maddie.

Her lack of smarts and bad habits that branch from it drive the family crazy until Axl's mother Frankie finally confronts Axl about April being the utterly wrong choice and he refuses to accept it and shuts Frankie out of his life. He marries April in a desperate attempt to solidify the relationship and realizes how wrong the decision was. He continues to date her even after they get an annulment, but eventually realizes the fire has died out and that he has no choice but to end the relationship because he's not truly happy with her after all. Its heavily suggested that Axl projected his feelings for his real love interest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lexie</span> onto April because he was afraid of being rejected by her (while he wasn't happy with what Frankie said, he didn't protest it because he knew she was right).

</li><li> Though he certainly fits the trope, Roy wasn't presented as a completely bad guy. He was always friendly, but insensitive.

Tim and Daisy's mutual attraction has always been understated and although we clearly see that Daisy is jealous, she does nothing to sabotage the relationship beyond some quiet muttering and veiled unfriendliness toward Sophie. Apparently the fanbase was torn about how to feel about the character; on the one hand they wanted to hate her for coming between Tim &amp; Daisy, but on the other she was likable and cool... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just before the end of the series Sophie was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and the series closed with some relatively - <em>relatively</em>, mind you - blatant implications that Tim and Daisy were getting together at last.</span>

The fact that the relationship was unsurprising in the sense that the two characters had a lot in common and a history, combined with a lack of chemistry between the actors, helped to make him a typical false lead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> played this trope somewhat in reverse, spending the first two seasons in full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> mode between Capt. Archer and Commander T'Pol, complete with occasional sexual innuendo (and an episode where T'Pol devotes her life in an alternate timeline to taking care of Archer), only to reveal that Archer was a romantic false lead and that the series instead intended to pair T'Pol with Trip Tucker, which played out during the final two seasons.
</li><li> Saint from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SugarRush">Sugar Rush</a></em> qualifies as the more sympathetic version of the false lead. Although Sugar insists she isn't interested in Kim, her instant dislike of Saint and near continuous efforts to sabotage the relationship — one time she claims Saint came on to her, another she robs her shop — suggest otherwise. If it had continued for another series these issues might have been resolved, but alas...

<ul><li> Leo in season 1, who was nice, well-liked by her father and a useful contact for Veronica... although it sure looked like she wasn't very invested in the relationship. Not to mention they hooked up just when her relationship with Logan heated up (after which she chose Logan over Leo without much hesitation).
</li><li> Logan himself could be viewed as an example for Veronica/Duncan, which was clearly a destined pairing from the start of the show, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">real life wound up writing the plot</a> for Veronica/Duncan in so far as the chemistry between Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring was electric, the chemistry between her and Teddy Dunn was nonexistent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which would have been oddly apt if they'd turned out to be siblings after all</span>. Factor in that Dohring is ten times the actor Dunn is, and that fans just weren't interested in their pairing (and indeed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when season two got them together again, people were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">not happy</a> that she wasn't with Logan anymore)</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dex, specifically at the point when he finally decided to start dating Zoe right after Torg realized his own feelings for her. Of course, this was set up right before the KITTEN slasher parody, so he wasn't a problem for the story for long. This did mean Zoe never got to realize what a jerk he really was, although she already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">should have done earlier</a>.
</li><li> Leo. Also a bit of a jerk in the end, as he was all right with Zoe's crazy stories about what happened in her life only until it turned out they <em>weren't</em> lies. Of course, Zoe and Torg still didn't get together after this breakup, because Torg was afraid of getting too close to her (since terrible things happen to all of his love interests) and Zoe somehow failed to realize he had romantic feelings for her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(or that <em>she</em> had romantic feelings for <em>him</em>)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tarvek. He's a plausible enough rival to really put the wind up Gil, but the authors are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">pretty clear on which way the ship sails</a>. The only way Agatha would end up with Tarvek would be if something irreparably split up Agatha and Gil. Also, as one character reminds Tarvek (as he's about to give up entirely and try to accept Gil as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">One True Pairing</a>), marriage among the nobility of Europe/Europa is about far more than just romance and love, there are important political factors and alliances to consider which mean Agatha may not have the option to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryforLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryforLove">Marryfor Love</a>. These same factors might just make Tarvek, who she still likes and cares for, a far better choice for her to actually marry than Gil.
</li><li> Lars is a more straight example. Out of all of Agatha's potential love interests, he is the only one who isn't royalty, isn't a Spark and is more than a bit of a coward, but despite these handicaps he is devoted to Agatha and does anything he can to help her. From a normal literary standpoint, Lars' underdog status probably made him the top candidate for Agatha's affections. He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies less than halfway through the series</span>.

Pothole is a tool through which the writers let out all their gross-out humor, making Lumpus a decent guy in comparison. Finally he confesses his love for her, but due to the dress he's wearing (don't ask) is mistaken for a woman confessing her love for Pothole. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>'s William Dunbar has all the trappings of this trope. He is attractive without too many sympathetic traits, is definitely interested in Yumi, and excites her romantic interest for a time, but ends up more of a close friend in her view in the end. Ulrich definitely hates him from the beginning, however, and he is played as a rival for Yumi's affection (William even flat-out tells Ulrich that if he doesn't make a move on Yumi, he [William] <em>will</em>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Leela dates a wealthy and handsome man — the Mayor's aide, Chaz. He seems charming and kind if a little overbearing, and Fry seethes with jealousy. However, Chaz's self-obsession begins to tire on Leela and reaches a peak when it turns out he has used his money and connections to buy the whole of the ice rink for their date, ruining the plans of a coachload of orphans from the same orphanage Leela grew up in. She asks him to let the orphans on. He refuses. She realizes what kind of man he is and leaves him.
</li><li> Adlai Atkins (Leela's plastic surgeon), whose main flaw is that he wanted to remove the extra ear on an orphan named Sally. (He was also willing to marry Leela and adopt said girl. Being an orphan himself, he knows firsthand how cruel the orpaharium can be for those who look different.) It gets hypocritical when Leela insists Sally is fine the way she is, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakinessShame">act squicked out</a> when Sally adds that she also has a tail. It's obvious the real flaw with Adlai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">is that he simply isn't Fry.</a>
</li><li> Once again, when Leela dates a man who she believes is the same alien species as her. It turns out, though, that he's a shapeshifter and planned to marry <em>four other girls</em> on the same day!

Most one-time crush characters, such as Summer from the episode "Summer Love," fall under this description, but two girls are particularly notable:
<ul><li> Ruth McDougal, the girl Arnold is infatuated with for most of Season One, is the understandable object of Helga's jealousy for the early part of the show. Arnold's crush on Ruth ends during a Valentine's Day date when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks">he discovers her inability to carry on an intelligent conversation,</a> while simultaneously having a wonderful time with a girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo">who turns out to be Helga in disguise</a>.
</li><li> Lila Sawyer, Arnold's longest crush. A sugary sweet country girl who Arnold develops feelings for, although she constantly reminds Arnold that she doesn't "like him-like him." Ironically, while Helga is jealous of Lila, her own actions are the only reason for Arnold and Lila ever even considering a relationship. Lila becomes aware of Helga's feelings for Arnold and coerces Helga into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfessor">coming clean to her about her love for him</a>.

</li><li> Both Jean and Scott in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> get their own false leads: Jean dates Duncan and Scott dates Jean's classmate Taryn, and then Taryn dumped Scott when mutants were revealed, not because she or he became a jerk, but for the same reason most of them lost their friends: He can, quite literally, blow up a building with his eyes. Duncan was an Alpha dog <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> type, who played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> trope (while he made it clear he was a jerk, he treated Jean <em>far</em> nicer then he treats anyone else), and when they break up, let's just say he takes his jerkery to a whole new level.
