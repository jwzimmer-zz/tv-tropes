Naturally his cursed form, the Northern Sage, thus is still around 700 years later doing horrible things.
</li><li> In the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>, Enma Ai is cursed for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking violent revenge on the townspeople who killed her</span>. Her punishment: to become the Hell Girl, bringer of revenge. She offers a service for people with bitter grudges they can't do anything about. She'll take the hated target to hell immediately; in exchange, the contractor will also go to hell upon dying. Thus Ai's "punishment" is a much greater punishment to mankind — her service keeps the vengeance and bitterness flowing. That's kind of the point — it's implied that her employer is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">the Devil</a>. She can only use her powers to avenge others; if she tries to send someone to hell without making a deal with someone else (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like when she figured out that annoying reporter and his daughter were descendants of her cousin</span>) she is sent to hell instead.
</li><li> Subverted by Karin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>. She has immortality and is unable to be injured due to having betrayed a great man that she followed (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">implied to be Jesus, and she the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingJew">Wandering Jew</a></span>). She treats it as a curse, but it was actually meant as a blessing so that she might one day find redemption.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with Witches in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>. They are terrifying, fantastically powerful <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> former Magical Girls who succumbed to despair</span>, and they are described as "spreading their curses throughout the world". However, they're more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster">Tragic Monsters</a> than anything else, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">kindest and nicest</a> Magical Girl can be corrupted into one over time</span>. Instead, they are described by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyuubey</span> as being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the logical end of <em>any</em> wish that is made</span>. In that light, their "sin" is seen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by the Incubators</span> as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having made the wish that turned them into Magical Girls in the first place</span>. There is a reason that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyuubey</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> its people</span> are almost universally reviled by the fandom.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, Jason Blood's binding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan">Etrigan</a> was punishment for betraying King Arthur and letting Camelot fall. Said punishment consists of becoming immortal and getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>. Of course, you may say that being eternally bonded to a demon (even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">noble one</a>) that hates your guts is a form of punishment too, especially since Jason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">appears to be seeking redemption for his acts</a> but aware he will never get it.
</li><li> The curse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">The Buzzard</a>, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoon">The Goon</a></em>, falls somewhere under this. The Zombie Priest, a powerful necromancer and implied demonic entity, cursed a Wild West sheriff to become an "Anti Zombie", an immortal being compelled to feast on the flesh of corpses and the undead, while still remaining alive and thus effectively beyond his control. He performed the magic to transform him into a zombie, but in a panic because The Buzzard was about to shoot him he messed it up. In doing so created his own worst enemy: a zombie-fighter who will never age, never die, can't become one of the undead, and eats both the zombies he kills and the corpses that the Zombie Priest needs to make replacement zombies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GenerationX">Generation X</a></em>, Penance was an example of the punishment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For teasing him, Emplate used black magic to trap his sister Monet in the Penance body, a red, spiny haired, long clawed, hard as diamond, erratic moving body. The Penance form also made it almost impossible for her to speak and her skin was sharp enough to cut through materials like pants and human flesh, this with claws replacing fingers made it hard to interact with anything. She was locked away and</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">periodically fed on</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by Emplate, the idea being if she ever escaped, she'd find no love from the world as long as she was in the Penance body.</span> Pretty slick, too bad she broke out and got love from Generation X.
<ul><li> Also different from some examples, the Penance body is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfDiamond">Made of Diamond</a> but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monet</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery">was arguably more powerful before being punished,</a> and managed to pass the punishment off on someone else who escaped it, leaving the Penance body hollowed out but still stalking around somewhere...
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo">Wendigo</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, itself based on Native American myths; according to the folklore, those who resorted to cannibalism in times of famine would be transformed into giants with hearts made of ice and an insatiable desire for human flesh.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman-Prime</a>: At the end of his first storyline as antagonist, he was imprisoned within the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> battery by the Guardians Of Oa, themselves. Not only does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">he escape in short order</a>, but his method of escape (absorbing enough of the battery's energy to break free) temporarily left him with supercharged power levels — strong enough to fly between dimensions, destroy planets on a whim and slap around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Mr. Mxyzptlk</a>.
</li><li> Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursors</a> of the highest order, this wasn't even the first time the Guardians of Oa had tried The Punishment and seen it blow up in their faces. They once imprisoned Sinestro in the central power battery, forgetting they'd already stuck the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">living personification of fear</a> inside there — which Sinestro quickly awakened. The resulting clusterfuck ends up killing all but one of the Guardians, reducing the number of Green Lanterns in existence from 3,600 to 1, and technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour">destroys the universe</a>. The lesson: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Can you Seal Evil In</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Cosmic Keystone</a> that is the very heart of your power should be two different things.
</li></ul></li><li> Penance (different Penance) used to be Speedball, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Fun Personified</a> character you've probably seen elsewhere on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>, until he caused a major accident resulting in multiple deaths, so he inflicts this upon himself. No one really got it. He's been restored to being Speedball, though the survivor's guilt that fueled his Penance persona is still there.
</li><li> The comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChakanTheForeverMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChakanTheForeverMan">Chakan: The Forever Man</a></em> (which inspired an obscure Sega Genesis game) is about the eponymous Chakan, a master swordsman, beating Death in a swordfight in order to gain immortality. He becomes immortal; however, for his arrogance Death curses him with a zombie-like visage and "eyes that burn with hellfire", and also to be constantly tormented by nightmares where "pain is real and unforgiving".

Examples include:
<ul><li> Strahd von Zarovich. In life he was a warrior who spent over 20 years fighting to free his homeland from foreign invaders. Suffering over a youth spent in battle, he eventually fell in love with his younger brother's fiancé, Tatyana. On the eve of their wedding, Strahd makes a pact with a monster to gain everlasting life and Tatyana's love. He is transformed into a vampire and murders his brother to have her. At the same time, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> by a rival lord kills off most of Strahd's retainers.

Decades later, he sent his armies against his powerful neighbors, but his enemies sent mercenaries against him, forcing him to flee. The Mists of Ravenloft drew Azalin in, granting him a vast kingdom over which he has absolute rule, but at the same time cursing him for his deeds: he cannot learn new magic, denying him the power he craves, he is haunted by his son's ghost, who serves as the voice of his conscience, and he cannot escape the demiplane, preventing him from correcting his greatest mistake and resurrecting his son.
</li><li> Lord Soth, described above, had the chance to prevent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">world-shattering cataclysm</a> but did not do so out of pride and jealousy. Since then, he had spent the next three hundred years listening to his banshee servants sing the songs of his failures. Eventually, he was transported to the Land of Mists and given an exact copy of his former castle, perfect in every detail... Except the architecture keeps changing, which drives Soth — accustomed to rigid military order — crazy. It's interesting to note, though, that out of all Dark Lords, Soth's Punishment in <em>Ravenloft</em> was barely worse than what he already suffered in his native setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>. That's probably why he was sent back to Krynn (the world of <em>Dragonlance</em>), from both an in-story perspective (his torment probably wasn't satisfying enough for the Mists) and from a meta perspective (he really wasn't that interesting as a Dark Lord).
</li><li> Vlad Drakov, originally from the Dragonlance setting, spent his free time as a mercenary general who won many wars but was constantly looked down upon by his clients as he yearned for a country to call his own. The Dark Powers provided in their own unique fashion, giving him a domain fashioned as a fascist dictatorship centered around a permanent police state and military government. Drakov was delighted at first, until he discovered that for all his new status, his new country was a backwater tract of mud surrounded on all sides by more advanced and prosperous domains. Which he tried to invade. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Over and over and over again</a>, each defeat replacing more of his reputation as a ruthless if successful general with one as a bumbling idiot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Vecna</a>, a demigod from the Greyhawk setting, was trapped by the Dark Powers by virtue of him tying too much of his power into his avatar. Being a god and all, there isn't really much the Dark Powers can do to curse him other than hold him in place and tie him into a physical form, which in a way is punishment enough. Vecna's domain is one where he has won completely, with undead holding all the honored places in society with living mortals as a permanent underclass, but the domain itself is a bare spit of land and Vecna knows the longer he remains, the more damage is done to his cause back on Oerth, which is where he wants his "real" victory. Eventually he goes into full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> mode and escapes, but nobody ever said the Dark Powers were perfect.
</li><li> How about Jacqueline Renier, a wererat who clawed her way into power? Her curse is twofold: First, she suffers from intense monophobia, which makes her prefer to keep her family (who HATE her) around rather than spend even a moment alone... Secondly, she is doomed to transform whenever she is in the presence of someone she loves. So, essentially, she wants love and companionship more than anything else but is unable to get it...
</li><li> Or Dominic D'Honaire. He was an exceptionally manipulative child, who frequently stirred up trouble among the adults around him for his own entertainment, yet always managed to evade suspicion. He was doted on intensely by the women in his life, in large part because his mother died giving birth to him. As a darklord, he now has the power to control the minds of anyone, making anyone adore him... Except for women whom he is attracted to, who are immune to his control and start seeing him as progressively more repellent.
</li><li> Pharaoh Anhktepot, Ravenloft's primary mummy darklord, suffered the Punishment <em>twice</em>. First, Ra punished him for his hubris by making his touch lethal, so he started killing his own subjects until the survivors murdered him. Then the Dark Powers got wind of his misdeeds, and confined this once-mighty king in a tiny domain with just a few hundred inhabitants; now undead, Anhktepot can become alive for a day by sacrificing one of its residents, but he knows that doing so too often means he'll run out of subjects and be alone forever.
</li><li> Alfred Timothy was the neglected son of Nathan Timothy, himself a former Darklord. Puny and weak, he was scorned by his father and eventually fell in with a cult worshiping a Wolf nature god hoping to gain enough strength and confidence to be accepted by his father as an equal. Eventually he succeeded and was transformed into a full-fledged werewolf, with the power to tear his enemies to shreds and command respect from his lessers. He was then cursed to transform back to human form if he ever lost control of his emotions. He would love nothing more than to give in to his bloodlust and kill and rape at will, but even as a monstrous beast he is forced to be careful and dispassionate in all things lest he reveal himself as a weakling and be himself killed.
</li><li> Lemot Sediam Juste was a successful theater actor in his homeland, extremely popular and successful, but tended to be pigeonholed away from roles that called for greater dramatic depth. He wanted to be seen as a truly great actor, but whenever he starred in one of these roles, his efforts came across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">melodrama</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">comedy</a>. He turned to writing his own plays, striving for the dramatic and gripping but achieving only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">needlessly violent</a>, using up his reputation's goodwill and finally turning the public on his efforts. He burnt down his theater with a full audience, his troupe, and himself still inside. He and his theater were resurrected, and he found that whatever he wrote on a script magically came to life on stage, but no matter how hard he tries, his illusionary characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">ring false</a> and his sets appear like matte paintings when lingered upon.
</li><li> There's also Ravenloft's version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard">Bluebeard</a>, who was married several times, kept demanding complete, utter and unquestioning loyalty from his wives, and when they inevitably failed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">brutally murdered them</a>. Now as a Darklord he keeps falling in love, again and again... but every time he does so, he sees his new lady love as one of his dead wives. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Rotting flesh, dripping maggots, and all</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">Malus Sceleris</a> was the son of a powerful druid. His mother died when he was young and his father was often away battling threats, leaving him alone feeling that his father valued plants and trees more than he did him. One day his father came home wounded and Malus finished the job while "caring" for him by giving him blankets and bandages tainted by disease, afterwards destroying the forest grove his father protected. The Dark Powers gave him immunity to diseases in all forms and the ability to spread disease to others by touch, but also gave him the permanent and unavoidable ability to communicate with plants, who understandably did not have many nice things to say. In his domain, he has made pollution and corruption a way of life in a way a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetandThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetandThePlaneteers">Captain Planet</a></em> villain could only dream of, because if even a single blade of grass existed within a mile of where he stood, he would be tormented by accusations and guilt.
</li><li> Meredoth was a powerful wizard and scholar from another world who wanted nothing more than to be left alone to pursue his studies in peace. In time, the ruler of his land granted him a distant landholding as recognition for his achievements and to get him out of the way. Meredoth was okay with this and saw the thinly-veiled exile as an opportunity for privacy and to get away from his obligations in the capitol. That is, until he found out his new land came complete with peasants who expected him to help them settle the new frontier colony. Eventually he got fed up with their complaints and needs and poisoned the entire population, transforming them into a unique form of zombie that kept their intelligence but did not need to be fed or sheltered. Thus freed of the hassle of human interaction, Meredoth continued his work until the Dark Powers swept him away. The Dark Powers gave him an uninhabited domain of his own, but also gave him the ability to spontaneously cast spells like a sorcerer, which to Meredoth is an insult to his long study and learning to have to use a "shortcut". The Dark Powers also took away his creativity so that he could no longer study and create in solitude; to get new ideas and explore new avenues of research, he would have to interact with others, which he cannot stand.
</li><li> Abd-al-Mamat was in life a wise adviser to a powerful sheik. All in the kingdom recognized him as wiser and better suited to rule than the sheik, but he did not have noble blood. More and more often, the sheik ignored al-Mamat's advice and the kingdom fell into ruin until al-Mamat arranged his murder and "reluctantly" took power for himself, ruling with an iron fist but bringing prosperity to the kingdom and its people. He was corrupted by power and eventually ordered the execution of a man married to a woman whom al-Mamat coveted and took for himself. He was cursed and a whirlwind of swords dashed him to pieces. He lived on as a spirit, immortal in almost every way, but he cannot interact with the world or be seen, forced to watch his kingdom fall back into ruins until the whirlwind of blades drops the last remaining bits of his body and he returns to life. Every century, he returns to life for one year and rules again, rebuilding his kingdom from a century of neglect and misrule, but at the end of the year the swords return and he has to watch again as his kingdom collapses without him.
</li><li> The really twisted element common to all of these punishments is that the darklords' own character flaws which led them to commit their Acts of Ultimate Darkness in the first place are what truly make their existence in the Land of Mists a living hell. If they ever worked up the moral strength to acknowledge their mistakes, the Demiplane of Dread would no longer be a prison for them. Then again, if they were capable of doing that they probably would never have become darklords in the first place.

<ul><li> If you're a D&amp;D drow and Lolth gets annoyed at you, she's liable to turn you into a drider, though that particular example of the Punishment doesn't exist in 4e, for the curious. The games designers took a long look at the powers the drider gained (more innate spells, increased toughness, better combat ability), their similarity to the spider (a holy creature in drow society and by Lolth's religious tenets), and the fact that the drider form is generally based off of one of Lolth's own avatars, and asked themselves: "why is this supposed to be a punishment, again?" Being a drider is now a <em>blessing</em>, instead of a curse. As of 3.5e, a more correct punishment appeared in the Fiend Folio supplement in the form of the Chwidencha, a near-mindless flesh-eating mass of spider legs. Drow who failed Lolth's tests would be transformed into these creatures. Originally, (1e), Lolth would test drow who got to 6th level. Those who passed were allowed to continue to rise in power. Those who failed got turned into driders — and their advancement frozen because of it. In other words, those drow who would be more useful at a higher level were allowed to get to high level, and those who weren't got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Win Win</a> for Lolth.
<ul><li> In the 5th edition this has been revised back so that the Drider is again a punishment for failing to please Lolth. However, to make it clearer that this is a punishment Drider's are driven insane by the process of changing and shunned by the rest of Drow society, doomed to live alone as scavengers in the Underdark for failing Lolth.
</li></ul></li><li> Baphomet, the Demon Prince of Beasts was once mortal and was turned into a demon as punishment for transgressions he committed against the gods. He reveled in the savage power his new form gave him and went on to become one of the greatest powers in the Abyss.

After they did their work, his people carved a glyph of damnation into his skull and threw it into the desert. Now he's a swarm of flesh eating beetles bound to his cursed skull that leads an army of mummies and skeletons while harvesting the souls of those he kills in hopes of finding one that can take his place in the afterlife.

Why would you put a repentant sinner in command of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> comparable in power to a Space Marine Dreadnought? Because the Penitent Engine is as much a torture chamber as it is a weapon, injecting the sinner with a cocktail of agonizingly painful chemicals whenever it is not plowing through enemies - ensuring that their pilots will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">charge into battle with no regard for their own safety</a>. Additionally, unlike a regular mecha, the pilot is strapped to the front of the engine, left completely unprotected from attacks, and injected with a drug that allows them to live through grievous injuries while not actually negating the pain of said injuries, which means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a> is the usual fate that awaits those unfortunate enough to warrant this punishment.

<ul><li> The current (2019) codex adds a new variant reserved for traitors from within the Sisters' own ranks called an Anchorite. After being wired into the Penitent Engine the traitor is subjected to additional brain implants that amplify their guilt and self-loathing exponentially before being encased in an armored sarcophagus, ensuring the traitor survives for a very long time.

Why, become an immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a>, of course, and spends eternity biding his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">for the day he is able to take down God</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In a subversion, it is revealed that God's intention was not to punish Cain but to give him eternal life so that he he would eventually come around to reflect on his mistake and try to atone for it: The 'punishment' aspect is more due to Cain's eternal bitterness and inability to see that he has the hope of atonement than anything else.</span>
