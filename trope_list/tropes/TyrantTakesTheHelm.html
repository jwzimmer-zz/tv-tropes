The person regularly filling this position, often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>, will likely be absent during this time (and this new replacement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">may have had something to do with that</a>). As would be expected of a tyrannical ruler, expect them to immediately start making "changes" and becoming an instant despot. Common changes made include the elimination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">Ultimate Job Security</a> and the decree that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a>. In most cases, the main heroes will have to confront this new ruler and attempt to change things back to normal.
</p><p>A common subversion of this trope is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant">Bait-and-Switch Tyrant</a>, who is signalled to be this in their introduction but turns out to not be that bad after all, with the story demonstrating that the characters have come to accept the new rules. If the character who temporarily takes control <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">isn't malicious or obnoxious, but is simply grossly incompetent</a>, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchySuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchySuccessor">Sketchy Successor</a>. If the tyrant took the helm of a corporation by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">acquiring 51% of its stock</a>, they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorityShareDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorityShareDictator">Majority-Share Dictator</a>.

He declares that he's going to increase discipline onboard ship and starts out by holding summary court martials in which he sentences a quarter of the crew to death - within one day of taking command. Since they were four days away from their homeport, the crew figured that at his current rate the XO would end up killing everyone by the time the ship made it back, and they hastily devised a plan to subvert his insanity (Note that the <em>Francis S Mueller</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">the duty posting for everyone the Navy didn't want at an important posting but hadn't screwed up enough to be thrown out... yet</a>).

He is unaware that he would not be King if not for his family's proper managing skills, and he was killed by the family of his would-be Queen because he was a sadistic idiot. His mother Cersei Lannister isn't far behind, as Queen Regent she empowers people of questionable loyalty, and is sabotaging the Alliance between the Lannisters and the Tyrells. Very soon she is removed from power, and the Kingdom of Westeros is slowly plunging into ruin.
<ul><li> Under the Lannister regime we have other examples of tyrants taking over. When the Starks, the beloved rulers of the North, are betrayed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty">the Red Wedding</a> by the Freys and Boltons, Roose Bolton personally murdering his liege Robb Stark, the Boltons are rewarded with control of the North. Despite Roose's talk of "a quiet land, a quiet people", under the new regime his monstrous son Ramsay Snow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">"the Bastard of Bolton"</a>, is legitimized as Roose's heir and goes round the North committing atrocities, flaying, murdering and raping people. However this trope is deconstructed, as many of the Northerners despise the Boltons, especially Ramsay, and Roose notes that his son's cruelty means they will never hold the North successfully.
</li><li> In the history of Westeros Maegor the Cruel's reign was this, when Maegor seized the Iron Throne after his half-brother Aenys' death, even decapitating the Maester who pointed out his brother's sons should inherit before him. Maegor was a monstrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadist</a>, committing atrocities and murdering two of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">nephews</a>. Though played with in that under Aenys the realm was already unstable, due to Aenys' weakness and inability to act decisively, leading to conflicts with the Faith, though the conflict became much more brutal when Maegor took over. Fortunately Aenys' youngest son Jaehaerys I proved to be perhaps the most capable King to ever sit the Iron Throne.

When the reliable Tyland Lannister dies of the Winter Fever, someone summons slimy plotter Unwin Peake to be Hand of the King. Peake immediately sets about firing or removing much of the King's council and replacing them with relatives and toadies, overriding the king's own choices and telling him to shut up whenever he actually does try objecting because he's "just a boy", and might well have arranged the death of Aegon's first wife so he'd be forced to marry Unwin's daughter. This state of affairs continues for three years until the other regents finally get fed up of Peake, who threatens to quit as Hand if his demands aren't met, and is met with the response "go right ahead".

Dauntless's original MO was to train its members to be strong and courageous, yet to remain rational and use their strength solely for keeping the peace. As Erudite became more entrenched in its plot to overthrow Abnegation as the primary governing faction of Chicago, it started slipping in its own members into Dauntless leadership. The new leadership, by changing the rules of initiation, would eventually wipe any semblance of honor from Dauntless and turn its members from honorable, courageous soldiers into merciless killing machines. After a few years of this, Erudite would finally have the perfect army with which to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">control via simulation serum</a> and then use to utterly destroy Abnegation.

<ul><li> The first arc has three of them. One of them is Brokenstar, who murdered his father Raggedstar to be ShadowClan's leader, and that's where things go downhill for the Clan really fast. He banishes all the elders from the safety of the camp, forces kits to become apprentices at three moons instead of six (and makes them warriors at five moons instead of twelve), and makes his Clan eat rotten food instead of fresh meat to focus on battles. He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">lets Brightflower's kits die</a> and shifts the blame onto Yellowfang (his mother and Brightflower's daughter), banishing her from the Clan. But a lot of ShadowClan cats get so sick of Brokenstar that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">team up with a ThunderClan patrol to drive him out</a>.
</li><li> Tigerstar seems to be a good leader at first when he becomes leader, rebuilding ShadowClan's strength, but he still tries to get back at his former ThunderClanners. But in <em>The Darkest Hour</em>, he takes over the RiverClan camp, starts up propaganda against half-Clan cats and executes them, and attacks WindClan to put fear into them and show what would happen if they did not join TigerClan (a mix of ShadowClan and RiverClan}. It was his tyranny that brings him to his bloody end, as an even fiercer tyrant named Scourge rips him open from head to tail.
</li><li> Scourge starts out as a kittypet named Tiny who ran away from home. After he slowly becomes the leader of the stray cats in the city, he forms BloodClan and forms harsh rules for them to live by. One of his rules is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">the weaker cats do not need to be taken care of</a>. He doesn't like families living together in fear of being overthrown and punishes them for living together.

However, this new cat ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> who punishes everyone who breaks any rule - even accidentally - and later anyone who so much as <em>questions</em> him. This especially becomes dangerous when he exiles both medicine cats and appoints a cat with no experience or knowledge of healing. Meanwhile, he himself breaks the warrior code by insisting he eat first, even before the elders. The cats remaining in the Clan are wary of each other, not knowing who they can trust and who will report them to him.

<ul><li> Also applies when a new sergeant of the guard or underling comes in. They're almost invariably sterner than the usuals.
</li><li> Also might apply to Crittendon. He's technically an ally, but he's both overcontrolling and a complete moron.

Of course Hogan and the guys immediately start devising schemes to return to the status quo.

The beloved leader of the SGC, General Hammond, is blackmailed into retiring and is replaced by a General Bauer. Bauer proceeds to break up SG-1, dedicate all the SGC's resources to building a big bomb and privately delivers the "things will be different around here" speech to O'Neill. O'Neill then sets out to get Hammond back and he is, of course, successful by the end of the episode.
<ul><li> Bauer also screwed up so badly in the episode (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blowing up an uninhabited planet which very nearly meant irradiating the <em>entire state</em></span>) that he probably would have resigned even if Hammond hadn't returned.

</li><li> The one time Winchester took the helm, this trope only applied to Klinger, whom Winchester employed as his batman. Everyone else was more exasperated by how much a nonentity in command he was, interested only in listening to Wagner and otherwise indulging in the privileges of rank than actually running the unit.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH">the original film</a>. Frank is left in command at one point, but he's so disrespected that he essentially has no authority.

Of course, there wasn't really a "regular" leader he was replacing, but Vogler did manage to pretty much take over the hospital and force them to run it his way. House, of course, opposed him at every turn and the rest of the main cast eventually came around as well.

Then the real manager returns ahead of schedule and takes back his job, sends Grainger back to his, and Grainger realizes that he's dug his own grave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan">Crossing Jordan</a></em> had multiple instances, one with Dr. Jack Slocum and another with Special Prosecutor William Ivers. The latter somewhat redeems himself in a later episode.
</li><li> Private Frazer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em> yearns to do this, angling for increased power and responsibility at every opportunity. Ironically, the one time he was temporarily put in charge he proved himself a much more effective leader than Captain Mainwaring. However, in following with the trope, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">power goes to his head</a> enough and he becomes enough of a bullying tyrant so that when the positions are returned to normal, no one really minds.

Contrary to the usual Tyrant, Morgan is — compared to his fellow 1973 officers, at any rate — a progressive, thoughtful and thoroughly competent administrator who only becomes a tyrant in that he's unwilling to put up with the sloppiness and ethically questionable conduct that Hunt encouraged. Sam Tyler, himself a progressive officer (with the excuse that he [to his knowledge] comes from 2007) finds himself actually admiring Morgan's methods even whilst he's trying to clear Hunt's name of murder. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later in the season, Morgan does reveal a bastard side, however, in that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">willing to go to any lengths</a> — including letting the rest of the team die in a botched undercover job — so as to discredit Hunt and allow himself to take over and reform the department.</span>

And, instead of finding a way to get rid of Hotch after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he beats George Foyet to death</span>, she feeds the team and Hotch lines to ensure that all testimony makes it obvious that Hotch had no choice.
</li><li> Acting DA Van Dyke on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium">Medium</a></em>.

Michael, assuming he will be promoted, names as his replacement Dwight, who immediately starts making odd changes.
<ul><li> This is also the crux of the Charles Miner story arc when Michael quits.
</li><li> Happened yet again with Dwight when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveCarell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveCarell">Steve Carell</a> left the show. This time, Dwight went on an utterly insane power trip, which is probably more a tribute to how much he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> than anything. After one episode, he was fired for <em>firing a gun in the office</em>, though he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">of course</a> retained his old job.
</li><li> Subverted in the show's final episodes where Jim manages to put a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> in effect where through a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> all of Dwight's crazy tyrannical policies are delegated back to Dwight to deal with.

</li></ul></li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar">Foyle's War</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first takes over when Foyle is suspended under suspicion of having committed sedition; he initially seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant">Bait-and-Switch Tyrant</a>, if a bit of a strict one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until it's revealed that he framed Foyle for sedition on order to get his job, so that he could murder a junior civil servant hiding out in a 'funk hole' hotel nearby whose incompetence he blames for the deaths of his mother and sister in an air-raid</span>.
</li><li> The second takes over when Foyle resigns, and is disliked by everyone because he seems disinterested and incompetent at the job — it's later revealed he's like this because he doesn't care about anything since the deaths of his two sons in the war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He ends up accidentally getting shot by someone gunning for Milner, thus prompting Foyle's return.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek">Greek</a></em>: Lizzie, the national representative watching over Zeta Beta Zeta, is a passive-aggressive Tyrant, promising any "slip-ups" being reported to Nationals.

</li><li> This happens at least once a season in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>. Usually at some point the competent head of CTU is either punished for not "playing by the book" or somehow incapacitated, and "Division" sends over a replacement, who is <em>always</em> an arrogant jerk who annoys everybody by being more concerned with strict guidelines and power trips than with doing whatever it takes to stop the terrorist threat at hand. Usually, this person is either re-replaced or finally comes to see the error of his or her ways, usually when they make things worse.
<ul><li> Special mention must go to Lynn McGill, who is such a tyrant that they eventually just declare him unfit for command and arrest him.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Edward Jellico in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Chain of Command (Part 1)". He made sweeping changes which, while normal for a regular armed force, were rather unorthodox for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> Starfleet. Given that they were facing the very serious possibility of armed conflict breaking out with a hostile empire, these were probably necessary, but that didn't stop the crew from complaining all the way through. Notably, he finally put Troi in a standard uniform (which was much more flattering on her anyway). Something of a subversion, too, since he rescued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Picard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Out-Gambitted</a> the Cardassians (a race that has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">their hat</a>). Picard even said he'd be keeping a lot of Jellico's changes.

</li><li> At the end of season 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> police consultant Harris Trout evaluates the Santa Barbara police department and suspends chief Vick, taking over as interim chief. His first act is to fire McNab for taking a side job as a male stripper, demote Lassiter, and refuse to hire Shawn and Gus for any more cases. In the 4th episode of season 8 there's a hostage situation in the station and when it's over Trout takes out his frustration by firing Lassiter, Juliet, and the newly rehired Shawn and Gus for "not being loyal to him", then receives a call from his own superiors informing him that he has just been terminated for his ham-fisted bungling of the situation.

<ul><li> Lt. Marrimow takes over and all but destroys the MCU in the fourth season.

</li><li> Marlo Stanfield, a small-time dealer, percieves the Barksdale drug empire as weak in Season 3, decides to wage war on Avon Barksdale's organization and take over West Baltimore, which he manages to do thanks to some luck and good timing. Unlike Avon who (mostly) refrained from killing people unless they interfered with his corners, (which is mostly part of the game) or he was looking to take over their turf, Marlo is a power-hungry sociopath who has people killed if he hears they were talking bad about him, questioning him, or even if they look at him wrong. He violently deposes the relatively peaceful old order and is responsible for dozens of murders.

While generally a good guy, his response to underage drinking was way out of proportion to the actual problem.

Snyder replaced Principal Flutie after Flutie was eaten by students possessed by hyenas.

The worst part is that Londo helped put him in power, as he and Lord Refa believed they could control him. Boy, did that plan backfire.
<ul><li> In "The Lost Tales", Sheridan meets Cartagia's son Dius Vintari, whom Galen predicts will become the next tyrant after Vir's death. His hatred for humanity would grow over the years and he would eventually stage a surprise attack on Earth. Galen's plan is to stage an "accident" with Sheridan as the trigger-man. But Sheridan backs out at the last moment and realizes that the real problem is Vintari's presence in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a> of Centauri Prime, so he takes the prince regent to live with him and Delenn on Minbar.

She was removed from her post by the end of the episode though.
<ul><li> After the return of Abby and Connor after their 1-year hiatus in the past, they find out that things have changed in the ARC. While James Lester (who is much more caring that he pretends to be) is still formally in charge of day-to-day activities, it's now partly a privately-funded operation with a tycoon named Philip Burton having a lot of say. While he's not exactly a tyrant, he's much more concerned with the anomalies themselves than protecting the people from all the creatures that come through. After he nearly dies thanks to Rex escaping his cage, he orders that all creatures in the ARC be put down, no exceptions. Lester has to blackmail him to reverse the order.

The current ruler, Winston Boragus, is actually something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> by barbarian standards. Through charisma and diplomacy, Boragus improved Krewlod's standing and recruited many formidable and capable warriors to join his banner. Unfortunately, this meant that when Kilgor wins and slays him at the end of the campaign, said army becomes his to command. Even worse, Kilgor had burned down many of Krewlod's farms during the Festival of Life, plunging Krewlod into the worst famine in its history. Kilgor's "solution" was to declare war on the rest of Enroth to plunder their lands. This would lead to Enroth's doom.

While the Earth Queen was a selfish woman who made her subjects pay impossibly high taxes in order to indulge herself in luxuries, her replacement, Kuvira, turned out to be much worse, as she is somewhat of a fascist dictator, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who'll even kill her own fiance to achieve her goals.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In Season 2, Episode 24 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Diamond Tiara is chosen as the new editor-in-chief for Ponyville's school's newspaper. She goes so far as to call her role a "new regime" while describing it and twists the newspaper into a muckraking gossip rag that humiliates most of the population of Ponyville and gets the Cutie Mark Crusaders ostracized for their role as "Gabby Gums". After the Crusaders apologize, Diamond Tiara is demoted and replaced by the much more benevolent Featherweight.

</li><li> In an episode of The Hub's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoundPuppies2010">Pound Puppies</a></em>, "McLeish Unleashed", Mr. McLeish finally gets the promotion he's been stumping for, and his position as head dog-catcher is taken over by the even more dangerously ambitious Milton Feltwaddle (last seen in "Toyoshiko! Bark Friend Machine"), who proceeds to turn Shelter 17 into a heavily-secured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoundsAreAnimalPrisons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoundsAreAnimalPrisons">dog prison</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Fortunately</a>, the Puppies manage to sabotage Feltwaddle's regime change and get McLeish to go back to his old job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode has Gus appointed as Acting King of the Playground while King Bob is away. His insane edicts culminate with enslaving the entire playground and forcing everyone to dig in the "cookie mines" (nobody's brave enough to ask why he expects to find cookies underground).
</li><li> Randall became one of these after blackmailing King Bob with a photo of a dress he was forced to wear by his sister.
</li><li> In one episode King Bob himself devolves from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable pseudo-authority figure</a> to an Egyptian tyrant after feeling like he'll be forgotten: being inspired by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, he renames himself "Pharaoh Bob" and forces everyone to build him a pyramid.
</li><li> The principal who seeks to replace Principal Prickly, who is not only immune to the pranks by TJ at first go (and in fact gives an Early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101">Room 101</a> discipline) but plans to turn the school to Auschwitz or Airstrip One Elementary school. The only reason he doesn't end up being the next principal was because of the poor pay offer by the school board.
</li><li> One episode sees King Bob preoccupied with a biographer, leaving his usually reliable assistants to handle affairs of the playground. When there's an issue they're not sure how to resolve, they come upon rules created by one King Mortie. This seems to work out, but the rules become increasingly bizarre. (Turns out Mortie was Acting King of the Playground during the Great Depression Era and his rules were meant to ensure that the poor kids would always have something to play with.) T.J. and company want things to go back to normal, but King Bob's assistants get a little too comfortable dictating these rules and effectively establish a secret police to enforce things. But don't worry, King Bob sets everything straight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SallyBollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SallyBollywood">Sally Bollywood</a></em>, one of her teachers, Ms. Smith, is replaced by a very strict military woman named Ms. Chicago who pretty much runs the class like a boot camp. It's later revealed that Ms. Chicago is actually Ms. Smith in disguise who went "on holiday" to teach the class not take her for granted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted twice when surly assistant superintendent Leopold stomps up to the podium in Springfield Elementary's assembly hall, snarls something to the effect of "things are going to be <em>very, very</em> different around here", then cheerily introduces a much more endearing individual as the replacement faculty member. The first time is in "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" when announcing Ned Flanders as replacement principal, and the second time is in "The PTA Disbands" with Marge Simpson becoming a substitute teacher.
</li><li> Inverted in "My Sister, My Sitter". After Lisa proves herself a reliable babysitter for the neighborhood, Homer and Marge leave her in charge when they go out. Lisa tries to be fair, but Bart (hating the idea of being babysat by his <em>little</em> sister) is as difficult as possible. After a series of pranks, he winds up breaking his arm in a fall. Naturally, it goes downhill from there.
</li><li> Played straight in "The Parent Rap" when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">Judge Constance Harm</a> (an exaggerated parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy">Judge Judy</a>) takes over for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Judge Snyder</a>.
</li><li> Homer addressing employees after he takes over the power plant:

Krell immediately starts ordering the clones on suicidal charges, scolding them for retreating from hopeless situations, and insisting on referring to them by their alphanumeric designations rather than their chosen names. In the final episode of the arc, he manipulates two units of clones into attacking one another, which finally pushes the survivors to mutiny against him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out he's fallen to the Dark Side and was planning on joining Dooku, making this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge">Mole in Charge</a> as well.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> episode "Banned on the Run", Mr. Big mind-controls the mayor of Fair City and forcibly takes his place, allowing him to come up with all sorts of silly laws and making the citizens miserable. In particular, he bans WordGirl and Captain Huggyface from being in the city. Despite this, WordGirl is able to stop Mr. Big and restore the original mayor by the end of the episode.

<ul><li> Many revolutions and coups throughout history have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">caused tyrants to come to power</a>.
<ul><li> The French Revolution is a very good example. Part of Napoleon's success was that he turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> compared <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France">to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Public_Safety">his<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Directory">predecessors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (at least within France).
</li><li> A double-whammy in early 20th century Russia, where the Provisional Government that replaced the Tsar (pretty tyrannical himself) was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution, bringing Vladimir Lenin to power. Under Lenin, the state secret police - the "Cheka" - ruthlessly suppressed dissent against the new order through imprisonment, torture and mass executions. When Lenin died, a power struggle ended with Joseph Stalin becoming dictator of the USSR and proving himself about twenty million times more brutal and tyrannical than Lenin had ever been.
<ul><li> Subverted after the death of Stalin by the Presidium having Lavrentiy Beria arrested, sentenced to death in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">executed</a>. While Malenkov and Khrushchev were no saints, they most likely prevented an even worse tyrant taking the helm in USSR after the death of Stalin.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> went through a period like this in the early '90s when Italian financier Giancarlo Paretti took over and merged MGM/UA with the remains of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCannonGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCannonGroup">The Cannon Group</a>. After he took command, he immediately began using MGM's money for his own purposes, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">hiring family members</a> and beautiful women, while the actual business of movie-making ground to a halt as people went unpaid. His reign was over quick as his creditors (who were pretty much corrupt as he was) seized control and Paretti was arrested for securities fraud. The whole sordid affair (which stretched back for years) can be <a class="urllink" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/07/08/214344/index.htm">read about here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
