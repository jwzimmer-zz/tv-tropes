Even when magic is involved, there are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">limits</a>.
</p><p>Despite this, somehow there's someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">who can do things thought impossible</a>, simply because they do not realize that they should be incapable of the achievement. Any of the characters might occasionally be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWasAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWasAGame">And You Thought It Was a Game</a>, but it can be a recurring trait for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">Bungling Inventor</a>. This trope focuses on the times the character in question achieved what he or she did largely <em>because</em> they had absolutely no idea that it was supposed to be impossible.
</p><p>In contrast to many cartoons, which consistently (and inconsistently) apply and dismiss physics for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, this trope is typically meant to occur when the act in question goes against whatever physics are firmly established within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a>.

If for comedy, it is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a> who does the undoable deed. If for drama, the character in question may be a genius or prodigy in his particular field.
</p><p>This happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, usually with things like math or physics equations and occasionally with feats of daring that the accidental daredevil hasn't been told are life-threatening.

</p><p>Please note that this trope <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">is not</a></em> just doing something despite not knowing how, or doing something by accident or blind luck.

After he's gone home, Ricotta does some research and discovers a sort of loophole in the spell that will allow Cinque to regain his memories and to return some day — and he just happened to have performed every single requirement of that loophole in the process of saying his goodbyes to his new friends.

Miyu, on the other hand, inverts this — she cannot fly because she thinks it's impossible, despite Illya doing it right in front of her. When Illya tries showing Miyu an anime depicting a flying magical girl, Miyu just points out all the scientific reasons why it shouldn't work.

<ul><li> The first part of the Chunin Exam is designed to test students' sneaking and information gathering skills. The test accomplishes this by being ridiculously hard so that the students will need to cheat to get the correct answers.

<ul><li> In one Sunday strip, Calvin was daydreaming in class that he was Spaceman Spiff, being attacked by an enemy craft. He dreamed that his ship was hit, and he started plummeting towards a planet's surface. <strong>"This spells disaster!"</strong> screams Calvin/Spiff. Then Miss Wormwood yells at Calvin to pay attention, and he quickly says, "Uhm, 'disaster', D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R." Fortunately, that was <em>exactly</em> the word Miss Wormwood had just asked him to spell.
</li><li> The same thing happened when Spiff was doing a countdown and hit 7 right when Miss Wormwood asks Calvin what 10 minus 3 is.
</li><li> And again when Spiff had just fired on some aliens ('Krakow! Krakow! Two direct hits!') when Suzie asks Calvin about the name of Poland's former capital.

</li><li> This happened in <em>Dilbert</em> again with Ratbert, who was told he was so stupid that he had telekinetic power.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ratbert:</strong> I have the power to watch television!
</div></li><li> In another series of strips, Ratbert decides to fly simply by flapping his arms. Dilbert insists it can't be done. Bob the Dinosaur gives Ratbert some advice that turns out to work, resulting in him flying near an annoyed Dilbert and remarking "This must be so embarrassing for you."
</li><li> One time Dilbert tells someone from Marketing that he reprogrammed his DNA into that of a weasel's. The poor dope is so gullible that he actually starts changing!

</li><li> In fact, in one of the early comics, this is how Garfield himself learned to walk on his hind legs. Until it stuck, he'd promptly face-plant when Jon reminded him it's not possible.

</li><li> Similar to the above-example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em>, there was one week-long series where Snoopy and Linus climbed a <em>very</em> large tree to investigate a "strange creature" in Woodstock's nest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which turned out to be an egg</span>. Eventually, Lucy came along, and Charlie Brown explained what was going on. Lucy shouted to them that dogs can't climb trees; Snoopy replied, "You're right!" before falling out with a crash.
</li><li> In early strips where Linus was still shown as an infant, he often displayed this trope. Examples included stacking blocks off-center well past the point they should fall over, and blowing up balloons cube-shaped. While Charlie Brown kept trying to figure out how he did it, Lucy was just embarrassed that her brother didnt know how to do things right.

<ul><li> Inverted, as appropriate for a story where clear thinking rather than ignorance is a source of power. Harry lists out all the laws of wizardry describing things you can't do, and looks for <em>restrictions</em> that would sound plausible to wizards ignorant of science, but make no sense from a scientific standpoint. Harry zeroes in on the law saying that you can't Transfigure parts of whole objects — because as a Muggle knows, every whole object is made of individual atoms!
</li><li> A more standard version of the trope is invoked in Ch. 59, where Harry suddenly realizes that broomsticks run on Aristotelian physics — they just go where you point them, rather than continuing under their prior momentum and accelerating in the new direction pointed — presumably because the witch who invented them had never heard of Newtonian mechanics.

When a 707 is stuck on a snowy runway and has to be moved off at any cost to allow another plane's emergency landing, he takes the cockpit and pushes the aircraft past its limits until he manages to get it moving just ahead of the plows coming to (destructively) give it a push, thereby saving the aircraft. Arguably Patroni is overqualified for this trope, because he knows the plane inside and out and exactly how much abuse it can take. What drives it home is when he's told afterward that the manual says what he just did is impossible—to which he replies the beauty of the 707 is "she can do everything but read." It's an achievement in ignorance for the <em>plane</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></em> is centered around William Cage, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">inexperienced soldier</a> who becomes trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> after being splattered in alien blood. But how did he get that in the first place?

<ul><li> In German, an achievement made in ignorance of the inherent dangers is frequently called a "Ritt über den Bodensee" (a ride across Lake Constance). This is based on a folk legend that was turned into a ballad by Gustav Schwab, <em>Der Reiter und der Bodensee</em> (The Rider and Lake Constance): In a cold winter, a rider loses his way in a snowstorm and without realizing it rides across the frozen-over Lake Constance. This is something a sane person would normally not attempt because due to the size of the lake<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2k4ux');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2k4ux" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2k4ux');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Germany's largest, with a surface area of 536 square km</span> and the Rhine running through it you could not be sure that it would be safe for a rider and horse to cross all the way.

<ul><li> Smedry Talents often have a subtext of this. Generally, the Smedrys can turn being very bad at one thing (for example, dancing), into being really good at something else (like fighting). Aydee Ecks Smedry's power in particular is being extraordinarily bad at math, so that she can, for example, believe that if you have one each of the three kinds of exploding teddy bear (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>), then that's six teddy bears total, making 3 extra appear.

In this case, it's primarily used to show just how much sorcery depends on the sorcerer believing a feat is possible. In particular, the adolescent Garion sees things as simpler than they actually are, which lets him do things that his learned elders think are too complex to be done. Belgarath notes at one point that this also puts Garion at risk, as this sometimes results in Garion attempting things that more experienced sorcerers would know are too dangerous to try.

</li><li> Also subverted in the fifth book, <em>Enchanter's Endgame</em>, by Queen Islena of Cherek when ruling in her husband's stead. Following suggestions of a fellow queen, she orders a priest trying to usurp power to go to the front lines or be sent to the dungeons. Such an ultimatum would be completely unacceptable behavior for the monarch, except Islena isn't well known for her intellect and is assumed to be ignorant of her apparent <em>faux pas</em>. Unable to counter the queen's order, his take-over not yet ready, and with no actual legal grounds to protest, the priest is sent to war. And once the priest is there with the rest of the army, he really can't come up with a compelling reason why he should be sent home again. Especially since members of his radical sect claim to be fearsome warriors who aren't afraid of battle. Her husband King Anheg later admits that he could never have done this because he <em>is</em> expected to know better.
</li><li> Also, in <em>Polgara the Sorceress</em>, Polgara comments on Belgarath's ability to continue at any given task unrelentingly, and supposes he may be able to "store up sleep" during his long periods of rest, something she knows/believes to be impossible. Just afterward, she decides it might be interesting to test the capacity of a human to do what seems impossible - when one doesn't know it—by convincing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Mandorallen</a> to pick himself up by the scruff of his neck.

When the main characters need to do just that, one of them leaps to the challenge, saying that he's been doing "impossible" things all his life and he's not about to stop now. As it turns out, the magic protecting the fortress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">gets stronger the more you believe in its effectiveness</a>—all you have to do to get in is to believe that you really can do the impossible.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The books run on this trope, particularly the four main characters weaving their powers together in the first book. Lampshaded when Niko informs Tris that the magic-seeing spell should have worn off a week after it was placed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Niko:</strong> There's an advantage to instructing young mages: suggestion counts for so much with you four.
</div></li><li> At the same time, though, it is noted by various characters that magic (much like science in the real world) has many things still unknown about it. You just don't realize this is so until the so-called impossible happens.
<ul><li> This is multiplied by the fact the main characters have natural ambient magic, which comes from an affinity to various crafts or elements, whose rules are more or less adherent as to the individual subject matter, as opposed to the learned university magic which is highly structured by it's schooled rules.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher">Jim Butcher</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The city folk say that the people on the frontier have such strong magic because they don't know that they shouldn't. More precisely, the frontier-dwellers tend to have "Furies" that are strong, but partially-independent and hard to control; the inhabitants of the central provinces have much better control, most at the cost of raw power (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">the nobility</a> are the major exception). Achievements in Ignorance is theorized as the reason for this, but it's never definite; it could also be that wild untamed furies on the frontier are naturally stronger, or living on the frontier hones people's skills in ways that soft city life does not.
</li><li> It's also specifically stated that doubt and uncertainty and frustration can inhibit furycrafting. At one point, a character across the ocean from Alera has a minor panic attack on suddenly remembering that theorists have asserted that furycraft is impossible on foreign shores, only to be reassured that another character has just accomplished several feats of furycraft (partly due to being too hard-pressed to remember it was theoretically impossible), and gets ordered to forget the theory.

<div class="indent">"The best swordsman in the world doesn't need to fear the second best swordsman in the world; no, the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before; he doesn't do the thing he ought to do, and so the expert isn't prepared for him; he does the thing he ought not to do; and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot."

Later, an actual terrorist strike using a stronger BLIT is stopped when one of the children is able to withstand the BLIT long enough to tear it down and throw it in the trash. The school staff realize that misusing the weaker one had given them a <em>tolerance</em> for BLIT images, something that hadn't been considered possible.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse">Dinoverse</a></em> with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce">Sentient Cosmic Force</a>.

Later it's shown that throughout the multiverse people have been building devices that do the same thing, and Betram must repair a broken one without tools while in the body of a Dilophosaur.
</li><li> This was a theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a>'s works. For instance, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkGentlysHolisticDetectiveAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkGentlysHolisticDetectiveAgency">Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</a></em>, a major part of the plot revolves around a computer programmer attempting to understand why there is a sofa lodged in his staircase, which was moved up there by a pair of removal men, twisted around in every possible angle, and declared irrevocably stuck. The programmer creates a computer simulation, which determines that it isn't possible for the sofa to have been stuck up there in the first place at all. He assumes his program is wrong but begins to wonder if he may have discovered a whole new branch of physics. This was based on an exaggeration of a real thing that happened to Douglas Adams while he was at university, but the story <em>does</em> have an explanation given later on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> caused a door to appear in the wall where there wasn't one before, and the people behind it were nice enough to open the door so the mover could get by. When the door vanished, there was no longer any way for it to go back the way it came.
<ul><li> For that matter, it's exemplified by the line from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a></em>, "There is an art to flying, or rather a knack.

His advice to Mort in his stint as his apprentice is not to think about it too hard and forget that you know that you can't move through walls. Mort is able to do this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">he isn't actively thinking about it</a> as he escapes a group of thugs by backing through a wall. Later books implied that this is because of Death's nature as being outside time - even if the wall is there <em>now</em>, there was or will be a time when the wall will not be or wasn't there, so Death instinctively travels through the space the wall occupies at a moment when there wasn't a wall, then reverts to the moment he needed to be in. When time gets imprisoned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime">Thief of Time</a></em>, both he and Susan temporarily lose the ability to do this, as the world is frozen in a moment and there is no past or future to travel through.
</li><li> Susan also uses this trope when she travels back through time to ask Death a few questions about her job. The Raven uses this trope as an example of why education is actually a bad thing.
</li><li> An interesting example is Lord Rust, Ankh-Morpork's foremost military leader by dint of heritage; the man is a total incompetent with absolutely no tactical ability or military knowledge whatever and does not seem to comprehend the utter futility of attacking a vastly superior force on their home ground with virtually no provisions. While this has the obvious result of killing almost every man under his command, Rust is completely unharmed, even though he leads every suicidal charge from the front. By all laws of probability, he should be dead long ago. However, Rust has the unusual ability of being able to completely and subconsciously ignore anything that contradicts or is outside his extraordinarily unrealistic worldview, assuming that it simply cannot exist, including physical danger. He has been reported as charging directly at enemy lines surrounded by projectiles without being scratched; arrows have apparently changed direction to avoid him (which then hit his men). On the Discworld, sufficiently powerful belief can alter physical reality, and magic has been described as more or less ignoring the laws of physics.
</li><li> Hodgesaaargh finds the newly-hatched phoenix because nobody told him that nobody had ever found one. A slight subversion in that the other characters think that it is this trope, whereas Hodgesaaargh also succeeds because he thinks of the phoenix first as a bird, then as a magical creature while everyone else thinks of it the other way round.

The ruler of the City of Souls is sometimes known as "The Unremembering King" due to his ability to "unremember things". How this works is if the king says he does not remember something, then it ceases to exist. For example, he doesn't remember that Afterlights with red hair aren't parrots, so they sprout red parrot wings. He doesn't remember <em>not</em> being a powerful Mayan king, so he becomes one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As he fell toward the center of the earth, he tried to save himself by not remembering there ever being a direction such as "down"—so he was teleported instantly to the only place where there is, in effect, no "down"—the center of the earth.</span>

</li><li> Humans in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExpeditionaryForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExpeditionaryForce">Expeditionary Force</a></em> series are at the very bottom of the technological totem pole and are absolutely helpless against the full might of the hostile species inhabiting the galaxy. Despite that, there are two reasons why they still have a distinct advantage over everyone else: 1.) All technology in the galaxy is based on how each species <em>think</em> reversed-engineered Precursor technology is supposed to work while the main character has befriended a Precursor A.I. who is the only one in the galaxy who knows how Precursor technology is <em>actually</em> supposed to work and 2.) Human scientific and technological knowledge is so laughably ignorant in the grand scheme of things that the main character keeps pointing out workable solutions and coming up with plans that succeed because he doesn't have the knowledge to "know" that such feats were supposed to be impossible. The flabbergasted and begrudging A.I. even comments that this trope must be humanity's hat.
</li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenAngels">Fallen Angels</a></em>, the main character Perry is charged with setting up claymores to provide suppressing fire in a sneak attack on some Vietcong soldiers. Just before the firefight begins, another character sees a Vietnamese soldier sneak out and turn one of the claymores around, but the gunfire starts before he can do anything about it. However, once the fight ends, they realize that none of the claymores fired in their direction. In other words, Perry had set up that particular claymore <em>backward</em>, and the enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">had turned it around again.</a> Especially impressive, given that claymores are labelled <em>This Side Forward</em>.

</li><li> This was the method behind the invention of the Infinite Improbability Drive. By way of explanation, the theory behind <em>finite</em> improbability generators was well-understood by that point and largely consisted of ensuring that probability was twisted <em>just</em> right to ensure an otherwise improbable result. For example, ensuring that, at parties, every particle in the hostess's undergarments simultaneously quantum-leaped two feet to the left. The INFINITE Improbability Drive was considered something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail">Holy Grail</a> for scientists but after centuries of trying they gave up and declared that it was next to impossible to create one. An underclassman, cleaning up after one of those previously-mentioned parties, realized that if it was ALMOST impossible, there must be some real possibility of it, and decided to find out what would happen if he worked out how improbable such a drive was, fed the result into a finite improbability generator, gave it a <em>really</em> hot cup of tea, and turned it on. Moments later, a fully-functional Infinite Improbability Drive was created. Not long after that, the underclassman was lynched by the now-thoroughly-annoyed scientists.

She just tells him to flip to the last page, where a link exists to a fully stable, torus-shaped world with one side always facing the sun and viable life on both sides. Not only does this impress Atrus's socks off, but it fully drives home the fallacy of Gehn's way of thinking: In an infinite universe, anything that <em>can</em> exist, <em>must</em> exist somewhere.

According to all common sense of astrogation, no single person can learn the necessary skills to fly a ship by himself, especially one of the size Hoyland was on.

</li><li> This is the explanation given for why younger wizards in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series have more power than older, more experienced wizards—they don't know or necessarily <em>care</em> about what qualifies as 'impossible'. Lack of experience also makes them less predictable, and empowering wizards is part of a very long metagame. (Younger wizards are given access to more power with less oversight because they're likely to do more surprising things with it and enough of those surprises benefit reality to be worth the gamble. This is not all good - from the flip perspective younger wizards lack the experience to do all the necessary day-to-day maintenance work of wizardry and thus are typically empowered to make far worse mistakes and attract greater hostile attention.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This happens fairly often with accomplished self-taught musicians:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">John Bonham</a> learned to play a bass drum triplet with one foot after listening to a Vanilla Fudge record and mistakenly thinking that Carmine Appice was doing the same—Carmine was an early user of a double bass drum kit. While heel-toe (which is essentially what he was using) is standard now among drummers who need to play extended double-kick rolls extremely fast, it was completely unheard of back then.
</li><li> Virgil Donati developed fantastic bass drum technique by practicing until he could play Deep Purple's "Fireball" with one bass drum, not realizing Ian Paice used a double bass to pull it off when he recorded it.
</li><li> The cornerstone of impressionist André Philippe Gagnon's act is his spot-on imitation of a saxophone (using only his voice!) perfected as a child when he imitated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryMancini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryMancini">Henry Mancini</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther">The Pink Panther</a></em> theme. Why? <em>He didn't understand that it wasn't a person making that noise</em>!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAge">New Age</a> guitarist Michael Hedges taught himself to play The Beatles' "Yesterday" in its recorded key of F, a very difficult key to play in using standard guitar tuning. He only much later learned that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> had tuned his guitar down a whole step and played the song as if it were in the much easier key of G.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Harpo Marx</a> was dismayed to hear that classically-trained harpists did not use their little fingers, because he did. He paid a tutor to teach him the classical style but eventually fired the tutor when it became evident that the tutor was more interested in learning Harpo's style than in teaching Harpo the classical style.
</li><li> Chet Atkins was a guitarist with a unique and extremely difficult four-finger picking style. It took him years to develop that style. He did it because he was convinced that it was impossible to play like Merle Travis with only the thumb and forefinger. He was wrong; that was <em>exactly</em> how Merle Travis played.
</li><li> Some left-handed guitarists like Dick Dale and Albert King play their guitars upside-down, with the strings upside down as well. This makes for some special chord structures and a special way of bending the strings (downwards, instead of upwards).
</li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' groundbreaking achievements come from them not being too familiar with the way music's "meant" to work from a traditional way. On "A Day in the Life", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> said he wanted all the instruments in the orchestra to start off on their lowest note, and then finish off on their highest, as loud as possible, after 24 bars. It was left to George Martin to transcribe that to music notation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6fofu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6fofu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6fofu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Martin eventually solved it not by having the instruments all finish on their highest note, which would have sounded even more cacophonous than the final effect, but having them all finish on the highest note that they could play which formed part of an E major chord, which creates the satisfying impression that they started in chaos and ended up in unison</span>. Another case involves "Strawberry Fields Forever": when the band had recorded two completely different versions of the song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> said he wanted to use the first half of one and the second half of the other. When the producer and engineer pointed out that they were in different keys and tempi, he just shrugged it off and said: "You'll work it out." As a result, they had to spend painstakingly long hours varispeeding and editing, but they successfully joined them together<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7cfwr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7cfwr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7cfwr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The splice happens exactly 60 seconds into the song</span>. Had John (or Paul on the "Day in the Life" example) been classically trained or had a more "academic" approach to music, they might never have come up with such original ideas.
</li><li> Carter Beauford, drummer for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveMatthewsBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveMatthewsBand">Dave Matthews Band</a>, taught himself to play as a young boy by watching himself in a mirror imitating what he saw his favorite drummers do. However, being so young, he didn't realize until later that by watching himself in the mirror he was doing the <em>reverse</em> of what his role models were doing. The end result, when he figured this out and learned to play "properly", is that he's one of the very few ambidextrous drummers in the world and has a unique style that's caused him to be considered one of the greatest rock drummers ever.
<ul><li> Jazz trombonist "Slide" Hampton did much the same; he learned to play the trombone by mimicking his instructor...which required flipping his trombone <em>upside down</em> and playing it left-handed!
</li></ul></li><li> Jim Stafford was completely self-taught on every instrument he plays, which astounds anyone who has seen him perform—for example, playing "Classical Gas" on <em>The Late Show With Johnny Carson</em>, it's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWXo-mMjZk">shocking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the acoustic guitar doesn't burst into flames.

At one point, Zappa called them "Better than The Beatles". Now with this in mind, go listen to one of their songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Origin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Origin">Mike Flores</a> developed his now-famous bass technique by accident; as a child, he was trying to learn guitar but kept losing guitar privileges whenever his parents grounded him, so he picked up his father's bass (which couldn't be taken away) instead and tried to emulate using a pick with his fingers instead of plucking. This was well before one could readily access instruction videos to find out how the pros did it, so he essentially just played in a way that made sense to him. This technique was, by conventional standards, totally wrong, but he didn't know this and became so proficient with it that there was no point in trying to learn how to play correctly, as he could play circles around just about everyone with it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Marty Friedman</a> is known for having a very unusual picking style that makes replicating his solos extremely difficult; as a largely self-taught player, he never learned how he was "supposed" to attack certain passages, and as a result, he developed a style that was his and his alone. Not only does he not palm mute (which is practically unheard of in rock and metal), but he regularly uses upstrokes where most guitarists would use downstrokes and vice versa, and he frequently picks from the fingers rather than the elbow or wrist, which is yet another curveball that makes his solos sound even more unique. The result is compositions that are far, far more difficult to play than they sound, which throws lots of players unfamiliar with his style off when they try to learn his solos and find that they just aren't coming out right with traditional pick attacks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slash">Slash</a> knows virtually nothing on music theory yet is responsible for some of the most iconic guitar riffs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, often through just playing around and with basic experimentation, and is commonly listed as one of the greatest guitarists in rock music history.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead">Buckethead</a> managed to learn how to play (at least most of) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShawnLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShawnLane">Shawn Lane</a>'s "Kaiser Nancarrow" because he didn't know Lane composed that song in a way that it was unplayable in real time.
</li><li> This is the topic of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollinRaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollinRaye">Collin Raye</a> song "What They Don't Know", where the narrator sees boys fishing in a tiny puddle and decides not to tell them they're not going to catch anything.
</li><li> Joe Walsh of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles">Eagles</a> taught himself to play the harmonized guitar part in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' song "And Your Bird Can Sing", not realizing that it was actually George Harrison double-tracking himself and that even Harrison himself couldn't play it on one guitar at a time.

</li><li> Pete Sandoval (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MorbidAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MorbidAngel">Morbid Angel</a>, probably the most influential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal">Death Metal</a> drummer ever) has a funny story about how he became known as "Pete the Feet". One day the other members played a recording of a drum machine, and lightly poked fun at Pete for it being faster than him. His response? He kept practicing and practicing until he was able to <em>outpace the machine</em>, eventually forcing the band the admit that it was, in fact, not a real drummer.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinjaSexParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinjaSexParty">Ninja Sex Party</a> covered "Africa" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto">Toto</a>, Danny was completely unaware that the verses and choruses were originally sung by two different people with very different vocal ranges, and sang both parts by himself.
</li><li> Neil Peart, drummer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>, plays three very fast triplets on timbales at the start of the song "Time Stand Still."

When the story's narrator is building his character, he instinctively picks the coolest-sounding stat options without consulting anyone else for advice, and only learns too late from the other players that the abilities he's chosen are considered by the other players to be pathetically underpowered and strategically useless. He'd made a brawler, but fists do zero damage against any kind of armor.

</li><li> Psionics in 3.X had a rather bizarre meta example based on how people played them. Since Psionic Characters used a pool of points rather than Vancian Spell Slots, their powers were enhanced by pumping a power with more points, either by raising the parameters in the power (Eg: 1 point per 1d6 extra damage with Energy Ray) or by powering their metamagics. A common phenomena in the game was known as "Going Nova" where a Psionic character would hoard their power points until the big boss and then pump them all into a single power to deal absurd amounts of damage and end the fight quickly. This gave rise to a false reputation of Psionic Classes being overpowered and many people issued house rules to "Cap" their power... except there was already a Balancing Factor to this built into the game: Psionic characters could not spend more points on a power than their current manifester level. In other words, it was mistakenly labeled as overpowered because players <em>didn't read the rules carefully enough.</em> This phenomenon was so widespread that a popular house rule was <em>implementing the limits that they already had.</em> In fact, when Dreamscarred Press released their Psionics Books, they made sure to label this limit "The Golden Rule of Psionics" and repeat in several times throughout the book <em>just to make sure people actually read it this time.</em>

<ul><li> Steve Jackson Games' role-playing system, which takes place in a cartoon universe, gives appropriately cartoony reasons for being able to do this sort of thing. If a character wants to walk off a cliff and on thin air or breathe underwater or whatever, he can roll to intentionally try to <em>fail</em> an intelligence roll.

<ul><li> This is how a lot of humanity's technology operates in the dark days of the 41st millennium. After thousands of years of scientific regression, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> not only has a monopoly on mankind's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>, they worship it and wrap all but the simplest of mechanical tasks into a religious ritual. So activating an ancient plasma reactor or whatnot involves a great deal of chanting, incense, the application of sanctified engine oil, and some specific taps with a wrench that just so happen to hit the "on" switch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> this is all a scheme to keep the common people from learning how to maintain their own devices, while other sources have the AdMech genuinely clueless of the scientific principles behind their shiny toys. In yet others, much of it is <em>real</em>, the Machine Spirits the worship is meant to appease exist, and advanced Tech Priests are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoWizard">wizards</a>.
</li><li> The Orks are an even more pronounced example. Greenskins don't have scientists that we'd recognize, but "Meks" and "Doks" with mechanical and medical knowledge hard-wired into their DNA. They can put together an engine block or perform an organ transplant purely on instinct, but wouldn't be able to explain how they did it. For the Orks' weirder, physics-defying inventions, the devices function to some extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">because the Orks expect them to</a> — Orks are latent psykers, but aren't conscious of this fact. This is why captured Greenskin technology is so temperamental or nonfunctional when used by a non-Ork, and why when it comes to Orky vehicles, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOnesGoFaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOnesGoFaster">Red Ones Go Faster</a>.
</li><li> An even more extreme example are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">Jokaero</a>. Similar to the Orks, these orangutan-like aliens are capable of creating technology on an instinctual level. <em>Unlike</em> the Greenskins, though, these aren't piles of junk randomly slapped together and brought to life through sheer willpower. The Jokaero can make some of the most advanced, highly miniaturized technology in the galaxy, utilizing advanced techniques and seemingly natural phenomenon that the best minds in the Imperium can't wrap their heads around. And they can do it with pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">any bits of junk that happen to be lying around</a>. A Jokaero can sit on a pile of technological scrap and assemble a spacecraft that is more advanced than almost anything any other race can put together. Again, another difference from the Orks is that anyone can use Jokaero tech. In spite of this, there is great debate if Jokaero are even <em>sentient</em>, as they don't appear to have any discernible language or culture, with everything they do motivated only by their will to survive. The evident lack of sentience, their innate technological prowess and the non-exclusivity of their tech means that the Imperium is willing to make them an exception to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> policy regarding Xenos, and Jokaero technology is highly sought after by both Rogue Traders and Inquisitors. That said, their creative process appears to be entirely random. Handing a Jokaero a bolt pistol could result in it having enough firepower to vaporize a tank in one shot, or an otherwise normal bolt pistol with some high-tech but ultimately useless flourish, with no way to discern which you are going to get.

<ul><li> In 1976, it was widely known in the computer industry that the circuitry needed to make an entire general-purpose computer work could not fit in a box smaller than a desk. Steve Wozniak designed the Apple 1 Personal Computer in 1976. He later stated that had he known more about computer theory back then, he wouldn't have tried to make the Apple 1 - however, what probably made it possible at all was his habit of taking Mini Computers (the desk-sized versions) which used 150 chips and taking entire weekends redesigning them, often with only 50 chips. This habit alone probably would have invoked this trope from the computer engineers of the time.
</li><li> Played straight by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison">Thomas Edison</a>. He had very little theoretical knowledge in sciences or engineering. Instead, he simply implemented what was known to be working, and tried the "brute force" method of trial and error until he got something working.
</li><li> In 1939, mathematics graduate student George Dantzig arrived late in class and copied what he thought was homework written on the blackboard. After taking longer than usual to solve the problems, he apologized to his professor for his lateness and turned them in. Six weeks later, he woke up to his professor knocking on his front door asking him to read the introduction he had written for one of Dantzig's "papers": what Dantzig had solved was not homework but rather two famous unsolved statistics problems. To this day, colleges and professors will sometimes place previously unsolved problems like these in with other more mundane problems on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTest">entrance exams</a>" or other evaluative tests, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">just to see if some brilliant young student who hasn't heard about the problem not being solved yet can find a solution nobody else thought to try</a>.
<ul><li> Dantzig's story eventually morphed into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a> of the student that was late for an exam and barely completed all the problems on the board only for him to be told that the final problem(s) were "unsolvable" problems and that he made history. The legend can be traced to Reverend Robert Schuller, whom Dantzig once met and told him about the blackboard incident only for Schuller to add the embellishments found in the legend.
</li></ul></li><li> When teaching young children how to play their instruments, a good teacher never tells their students that anything is "easy" or "hard". As a result, those children learn to play well much more quickly.
</li><li> There is also an urban legend about a French immigrant who made a huge business in the USA during the Great Depression. When questioned about the achievement, he stated that his English was so bad back then he could read no newspapers—and, therefore, knew nothing about the depression.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>, also doubles as an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>. He is constantly praised for his groundbreaking techniques in the manga industry, but he was clueless about said industry when he started. Since he didn't really know what the general tricks of the trade were, he just did what he felt like doing and just published it. The works he produced have since been regarded as some of the most innovative material of its time.
</li><li> Money in general works like this; as soon as you have an economy that's no longer based on the most primitive level of trade, you need to have a mutual agreement to ignore the logical problems of your system. Especially prevalent with banks; they work fine as long as everyone <em>acts as if</em> their money will be safe in the vaults, but if too many people think it might be safer if they withdraw it, the whole thing falls apart (though this is only actually a problem with fractional reserve banking<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ufxu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ufxu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ufxu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this means, basically, that at any given time the bank has less money in its vaults than the total amount that has been deposited, the remainder having been loaned out ... which is how banks can afford to pay interest rather than charging people to store their money</span>).
</li><li> Every recession is an aversion of this trope (even if it looks like it's not at first): the economy does well, people become optimistic and start living above their means, debt skyrockets, the future returns are no longer capable to carry that amount of debt let alone new debts, people panic, everything comes crashing down. Sure, it may be tempting to think that if everyone went on spending future money and nobody panicked everything would be dandy—but people forget that they panicked for a reason and that debt is a very real thing. Some basic economic principles can't be ignored with just a fearless attitude any more than you can ignore the laws of physics. Money may be more flexible and complicated than a barter economy, but it is still needed for very real things. This trope is, however, what makes recessions possible in the early "hey that's a problem for future me and by then I'll be super rich" phase—not to mention that money depends on being certain that it will be worth something in the future. So, yeah, this trope is a very mixed bag when it comes to the economy: It's both a boon and a curse.
</li><li> There is a story of a viral video that went around depicting a man playing baseball with nun-chucks. A martial arts master repeated this apparently unaware that the videos were faked and it was thought impossible.
</li><li> The placebo effect can be considered an example of this phenomenon. Someone who has been given a sugar pill for their health problems and thinks it's actual medicine will usually feel better, at least the first few times they take the "medicine". It's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>. However, this only improves subjective conditions like pain, or ones with a mental or stress-related component, like insomnia. Diseases which are uninfluenced by mood or emotion will not be affected by the placebo effect (people will temporarily <em>feel</em> better but not <em>be</em> better). This is part of the reason that people can feel convinced that an ineffective "alternative" remedy has helped them—we humans are pretty bad at figuring out what's affecting our own health, so that's why double-blind trials were invented!
<ul><li> The placebo effect can cause subjects to experience the supposed side effects of the drug. In one notable example, almost half of the men in one study reported total hair loss after taking a placebo that they were told was a "cancer drug" - even though they hadn't been directly told that the drug had any side effects.
</li><li> On the lower end of drugs, the placebo effect can even override the actual effect of a drug. Studies have been done using medication for causing and treating nausea, with the subjects told that the drugs were the opposite of what they were. The worked based on what people believed theyd do rather than the actual chemical effect.
</li></ul></li><li> People can get sick if told they have been poisoned or that a dummy pill has possible side effects. This is called the Nocebo effect. As with the placebo effect, there is nothing external to the body causing it. Similarly, people can get "drunk" when drinking non-alcoholic beverages just by thinking they are alcoholic.
</li><li> Charles Babbage, credited as the inventor of the mechanical computing machine. When he first drew up the concept, he believed that the <em>first</em> such machine was the "Mechanical Turk" (a chess machine which had played Napoleon, among others). The Turk was, however, exposed as a <em>very</em> clever hoax, designed to accommodate a very small concealed human operator, around the time he got started on building the first actual mechanical computer prototype.
</li><li> Timothy Dexter was an eccentric businessman in 18th Century New England. Born poor and married into wealth, his uneducated ways led his contemporaries to give him bad advice in an attempt to bankrupt him. He literally shipped coal to Newcastle, an English coal-mining town, and made a profit because it landed there during a miner's strike. Bed warmers shipped to the Caribbean were used to ladle molasses and gloves and mittens sent there were resold for redistribution in Asia. Bibles shipped to pagan areas were bought by missionaries and stray cats were used against rats in West Indian crop fields. A poorly written autobiography (with no punctuation and random capitalization) ended up being popular in its own time and a collector's item today.
</li><li> An occasional concept in military thought; for an attack from which there is no possibility of retreat, such as an amphibious landing, green soldiers often perform better than veterans. This is because they are unfamiliar with the dangers of what they are attempting, and will, therefore, try things that veterans know carry a high risk of ending in death.
</li><li> An adage from Murphy's Laws of Combat:
<div class="indent">"Professional soldiers are predictable; the world is full of dangerous amateurs."
</div><ul><li> Perhaps the greatest example of this in the 20th Century is Operation Barbarossa in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. It should have been impossible to launch a surprise attack of its scope on the Soviet Union; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> was paranoid beyond belief and had perhaps the world's greatest spy network under him, who found out leagues of information and passed it on. Stalin dismissed it. He and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> were very similar in several aspects, and Stalin attributed his thought process to Hitler, that being that it would be ridiculous for Germany to open a two-front war with its limited resources. No competent man (like Stalin saw himself as, and by extent Hitler due to their similarities) would be so stupid. But Hitler was a delusional racist who saw invading the Soviet Union as manifest destiny and as part of his high calling to cull the world of all inferior races, of which Slavs and Bolsheviks ranked very highly. So he did, and Stalin, thinking Hitler's madness to be some sort of trick to break the alliance they had, would find his country caught completely off-guard and nearly defeated (or at least badly crippled) before they could begin to fight back, until the idiocies that had accidentally let Hitler catch the Soviet Union with their pants down caught up with Nazi Germany and ultimately led to their attack bogging down, stopping, and ultimately being repelled and reversed all the way back to Berlin as the Reich came crashing down.
</li><li> Most of Hitler's war plans fall under this. With Germany coming out of a deep recession, and very lacking in strategic resources, they simply did not have the capability to sustain any conflict for more than a few weeks. Hitler, either unwilling or unable to accept this, ordered his armies to attack anyway. Contrary to popular belief, both Poland and France had large and fairly modern armies for the time (France in particular not only had more tanks than Germany but also better ones at the start of the war), so it was unthinkable that Germany even had a chance. The German generals came up with blitzkrieg, combined arms tactics that managed to capture strategic points before the opposing armies could react. This worked rather well until they tried it on a country that could easily trade land for time to engage their full military potential (see above).
</li><li> In the (snowy) Battle for Vimy Ridge, the Canadian 85th Highlanders of Nova Scotia succeeded in attacking Hill 145, the highest part of the battlefield and a linchpin in the Germans' defences. The unit was completely green and used only for work parties thus far. Their artillery barrage preceding their attack was called off unknown to them (in fear of friendly fire because of the close proximity of their trenches to the Germans), and the 85th attacked moments after the silent zero hour with a battle cry regardless. The German defenders were mostly caught by surprise on account of them knowing a large artillery barrage for the intent of suppressing the defenders always came soon before attackers would reach them so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">no one in their right mind would try to attack without it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Before and during World War II, the US Army Ordnance Department was searching for sufficient aircraft auto-cannon designs but declared that there was no possible way to safely scale up the Browning M2 heavy machine gun into a viable auto-cannon, for such a project would supposedly make the new gun too heavy for aircraft mounting and too impractical to maintain. But across the Pacific Ocean, the various engineers designing aircraft-mounted machine guns for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force had already copied the basic .50 caliber Browning M1921 aircraft machine gun and gave it a higher firing rate as the Ho-103 in 1941. Further development (without anyone in Japan knowing that the original design should have theoretically failed if made bigger) yielded the very successful <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/MG/I/MG-5.html">Ho-5 20mm cannon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (a scaled up Ho-103), which was installed in many an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane">advanced fighter plane</a> and eventually the 37mm Ho-204 (a scaled up Ho-5), which was fitted to interceptors intended to shoot down American bombers.
</li><li> Martial arts of any kind show a similar strange pattern. A rank amateur with no training is often a greater threat to a master than a beginner since the completely untrained individual will be unpredictable. They may land a lucky shot or series of shots. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a> due to ignorance. This can become very funny in fencing. A martial artist who takes up the sport often has trouble adapting at first and is easy prey to an experienced fencer. A raw beginner will sometimes score hits by accident, especially in épée, where there are no rules about priority or target area. They're just waggling their weapon unpredictably and getting lucky.
</li><li> In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4">Channel 4</a> hosted a poker tournament between pro and amateur players, the pros said they struggled with the amateur players, having gotten so used to the tells of their fellow pros. This is likely why so many amateur players can have success in big poker tournaments with seasoned pros: both their tells and betting patterns are foreign to the pros, leaving them far more unpredictable. (A word of warning to anyone hoping to replicate this feat: there are several poker strategies that are very good at taking money from poor players but have serious weaknesses. Expert players wouldn't bother trying them against other experts, but if they have reason to believe that their opponent wouldn't know the appropriate counter-strategy, they can and will use one of these to win easily...unless luck is <em>really</em> against them)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> came up against a similar situation. His friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneSiskel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneSiskel">Gene Siskel</a> was a very good poker player, who had cleaned up at his bachelor party. At Ebert's, however, he lost. When Roger asked him what happened, Gene replied, "Your friends don't know how to play poker. You can't win against someone who makes a bet for fun."
</li></ul></li><li> This can even come up in chess matches, despite both sides knowing the same information—trying to figure out what the amateur is doing can confound the professional because the amateur <em>doesn't</em> know what they're doing, and so can't be predicted. Also, amateurs will perform the most ridiculous, foolish moves that no competent player would make, and thus a pro might leave themselves open to something resulting from such a move, or find it difficult to realize that it is even being attempted.
<ul><li> The four-move checkmate is the single most basic strategy in chess, the very first play most beginners are taught, and consequently, the easiest to defend against. However, multiple masters have been humiliated by amateurs because of it - the master doesn't think to defend against it because no serious opponent would ever use it, whereas the amateur tries it because they don't understand enough to realize it shouldn't work.
</li></ul></li><li> For years, physicists knew you could not suspend one magnet over the other without some sort of additional support. The top magnet would either flip due to the attractive forces or slide off. This had been given a beautiful mathematical proof, and anyone caught illicitly trying to disprove it would be the subject of some teasing. However, eventually, someone came along who had the good fortune of not knowing that floating one magnet over the other had long been proven impossible and promptly solved the problem: just spin the free-floating magnet like a top. The original proof had been right as far as it went, but spinning the magnet was a loophole no one had accounted for (save, in a broad sense, superconductors, which work on similar principles but aren't magnets).
</li><li> Evolutionary computer design is based on this principle: you set the end goals you want the program to achieve but don't give it specific instructions on how to get there, allowing the program try some solutions by randomly altering some of the variables, test them, combine the best of them and randomly "mutate" some of the variables again, and go on. The end result is often something no human would ever design but would perform at least as well if not better.
<ul><li> One example was designing a structural "backbone" for a space station. Human designs involved a standard radio-tower style beam, while the computer produced <a class="urllink" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~ajk/truss/welcome.html">an organic design<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that looked like an actual bone, massed less, and was structurally stronger.
</li><li> Perhaps one of the strangest examples was when a piece of programmable hardware ran a genetic algorithm to try to create an oscillator and ended up creating a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2732-radio-emerges-from-the-electronic-soup.html">radio receiver and parasite at the same time.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Another <a class="urllink" href="http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/">experiment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> run on a programmable logic array to distinguish between sounds resulted in a circuit where part of it wasn't even connected to any inputs, outputs or the rest of the circuit, but if removed resulted in the circuit failing. It also didn't work when copied to another chip of the same kind which means it used <em>subtle manufacturing defects</em> of the chip as integral parts of the circuit!
</li><li> And there's <a class="urllink" href="http://boingboing.net/2004/06/28/evolved-antenna-desi.html">this antenna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which manages better coverage, less energy spent, <em>and</em> skipping some steps of the production process. And also looks like a spider with a bad seizure.
</li></ul></li><li> The reason martial arts expert Tony Jaa can pull off his amazing stunts without wires is that he grew up watching martial arts movies without knowing there was such thing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireFu">Wire Fu</a>. <em>Nobody thought to tell him he couldn't do what he eventually managed to do</em>.
</li><li> In informal shooting competitions, it isn't uncommon to see people do things with weapons that any knowledgeable person would consider ludicrous, such as learning how to actually use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a> because they haven't been told it's impossible. Pretty much, they overcome a lack of formal knowledge and sub-optimal setups just with sheer amounts of practice and stubbornness.
</li><li> Many of the innovative visuals and special effects seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em> are the result of first-time film director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> simply refusing to believe that certain things couldn't be done on screen.
</li><li> A literal case of this with gamers who earn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360">Xbox 360</a> Achievements (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PS3</a> Trophies) without looking up the requirements on what is needed to get them. Specifically, when you're near the end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> and are aware of it, you might start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">locking up or playing too conservatively for your own good</a>. No such problem if it hasn't occurred to you that you haven't taken damage or don't realize there's a reward at stake. Particularly prevalent in Rhythm games, where players can enter an almost trance-like state of mind when they're doing well, only to be sucked out of it when they realize how well they're doing, usually resulting in them screwing up.
<ul><li> It also applies to playing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RetroAchievements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RetroAchievements">Retro Achievements</a> emulators, particularly concerning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">cheevos</a> that are thought to be nigh-impossible to earn, achieving high scores and rising up quickly in the global ranking.
</li><li> This idea also exists in non-video games and sports as well. For example, one of the unwritten rules of Baseball is that if a pitcher is doing extraordinarily well, such as if they are in the process of accomplishing the rare feat of a no-hitter or perfect game, that their teammates are not to bring this fact to their attention.

</li><li> <em>Fold It</em> is a free game about figuring out how proteins fold. Player's results go to researchers over the Internet to see how if the result works. This game helps in a few ways. The first is you can have more people trying to figure out how the proteins fold with almost no training. The other is that many players, due to lack of training, do not have preconceived notions of how proteins should fold. For 15 years, scientists were trying to figure out how a protein in a type of AIDS-causing virus folds. They released the protein as a puzzle in <em>Fold It</em>. Players submitted a solution to how the protein actually folds in 10 days.

</li><li> In one of the greatest running spectacles in history, an old man named <a class="urllink" href="https://www.badassoftheweek.com/young">Cliff Young<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed up at the start of one of the world's most hellish and mind-numbingly long ultramarathons, totaling 875km between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in denim overalls and wellies. He never had the slightest chance at finishing the course, as everybody could see, but days spent rounding up sheep on his family farm had convinced him that he could make it through. Five days and fifteen hours later, he crossed the finish line a victor. Apparently, nobody had told him competitors in this race were supposed to stop for sleep breaks, so instead, he just kept going and broke the course record by more than <em>two days</em>. Not realizing that there was a prize for winning, he split the $10,000 reward equally between the next five competitors. His running style, dubbed "The Young Shuffle", was deemed by athletic trainers to be one of the most efficient ways to travel while conserving the most energy. Three other athletes copied his technique to win the race later on.
</li><li> There's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a> that bumblebees fly even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">science has proven</a> that they can't<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12bei4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12bei4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12bei4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, somebody tried their proportions in the equations for <em>fixed-wing</em> flight and it, unsurprisingly, didn't compute. (They didn't even expect it to.) Later retellings of the story missed the key detail that <em>bees move their wings a whole lot</em> in flight.</span>. This trope is part of the "don't believe the naysayers" Aesop underlying that story.
</li><li> Burmese pythons are natural climbers when young. In the wild, however, as they grow to over 12 feet long and 100-150 lbs, the trees they used to climb no longer support them and, after falling a few times and hurting themselves, they learn to stop climbing and hunt along the ground. People who own Burmese pythons as pets keep them from hurting themselves, usually by catching them if they're going to fall. So they never learn they shouldn't climb anymore, and amusing pictures can be found of giant snakes on top of cat trees and bookcases and the like.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau">Tommy Wiseau</a> may be the ultimate modern example. To describe the man as, shall we say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">not handsome</a></em> and bereft of filmmaking and acting knowledge or talent would be charitable. Fifteen years after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">film debut</a>, it still plays to packed screenings and became the subject of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisasterArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisasterArtist">biopic</a> that not only <em>won a Golden Globe</em> but whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco">lead actor</a> invited Tommy on stage to thank him for his gift to the world.
</li><li> Author Mario Puzo admitted that when he adapted his 1969 novel <em>The Godfather</em> to a screenplay for the first two installments of the film trilogy, he had no idea what he was doing, having had no prior experience or instruction in screenplay writing. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> and <em>The Godfather Part II</em> netted him one Oscar each for Best Adapted Screenplay, Puzo decided to properly learn the trade and obtained a starter's book on how to write a screenplay; the first chapter read, "study <em>Godfather I</em>."
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> was studying chemistry, he detested the subject and did poorly on lab work, continuing only out of inertia. Unexpectedly, one of his least favorite teachers began to fiercely advocate for him in his second year of undergraduate studies and was a large part of the reason he was allowed to stay in school to get his PhD. Why? The year he'd had the teacher, the man had deliberately given him problems above his level to try and make him drop out, but he hadn't realized that he was being tricked and had solidly worked through everything he was given without asking for extra help. As Asimov later wrote, "I stubbornly worked through them, however, and did so without complaint because I was too stupid to suspect conspiracy."
</li><li> Betty Edwards' <em>Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain</em> is highly regarded as being one of the best books on drawing in spite of it initially being based on the "Left Brain/Right Brain" theory, which has long since been proven false. The reason? The techniques the books used to help others learn how to draw <em>actually work</em>. Newer editions of the book now speak of the Left Brain/Right Brain theory in a figurative sense instead of a literal one.
</li><li> Elon Musk's business ventures are usually based on that model. He had no practical experience in either aviation, engineering or automotive design and so he did not know how an electric car was "supposed to" look like, nor did he build a rocket the way it was "supposed to" work. This of course resulted in the highly successful Tesla and rockets that replace complex electromechanical parts with "simple" computer programs that were simply unavailable when the first rockets were built in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s, However, if <a class="urllink" href="https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/loopy-ideas-are-fine-if-youre-an-entrepreneur/">this blog post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is anything to go by, this approach has its limits.
<ul><li> This has been shown to be prophetic, as Tesla has begun suffering on the market due to poor quality control and Musk's behavior ranging from eccentric to criminal. The Hyperloop project still has not begun and the only working test showed an SUV slowly driving through a narrow, roughly finished tunnel.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted or inverted in the young Richard Feynman's research in liquid helium. He managed to calculate everything he attempted with one exception: the order of a phase transition in liquid helium. Following a presentation, one of the field's tribal elders announced one thing Feynman should be wised up on: nobody has ever been able to determine the order of a phase transition from first principles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks">Arc System Works</a>, as a whole, had little to no experience with Unreal Engine 3. They still made it run <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> Xrd</em> at a solid 60 FPS, with stylized looks and animation reminiscent of high-quality sprites, and generally made it <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/HaSNO-1esho?t=29m46s">look amazing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> It should be noted that while Arc System Works lacked experience with UE3, they had plenty of experience in a pertinent area for their intent. Their earlier sprite-based fighters were a ready reference for what they wanted the game to look like, and they underwent intensive research of how animation tricks the eye. The result is one that can't work with other types of games and takes a lot of work, but is perfectly suited for their purposes.
</li></ul></li><li> When he was 13 years old, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter">Jim Shooter</a> realized that his family needed money, and resolved to get a job to help them out. As he was a big fan of comic books, he decided to become a writer on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>. His parents never bothered discouraging him because they knew that he'd receive nothing but a rejection letter anyway - except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> liked his scripts so much they offered him a job. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">He remains the youngest writer ever to write comic books professionally.</a>
</li><li> There's a saying in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go">Go</a> that those who simply know Joseki (a series of standard, well-known plays) are worse than newbies. Newbies still make moves that are unpredictable, but those who simply play out Joseki are predictable. The point of knowing Joseki though is to understand when such moves are useful and when they are not to counter them.
</li><li> In 1925, Marvin Pipkin succeeded in developing an inside frosted lightbulb that wasn't brittle, not knowing that the task was assigned to him as a prank as developing such a lightbulb was supposed to be impossible.
</li><li> On September 17th, 2016, a bomb went off in Manhattan, New York's Chelsea district. Police ended up discovering a second bomb, a pressure cooker bomb, already disabled. After a while, security footage was found and the mystery of how the second bomb was disabled was revealed — two men later revealed to be Egypt Air airplane security guards, discovered the suitcase the bomb was in in the middle of the road. Not realizing the discarded suitcase was a bomb and feeling bad that such a good suitcase was going to waste, the men approached the suitcase, opened it, discarded the "pot" and took the suitcase.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HJonBenjamin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HJonBenjamin">H. Jon Benjamin</a> became an awesome piano player on his first try <em>even though he didn't know how to play the piano in the first place.</em> Then again, he plays jazz piano, where the whole idea is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">making it up as you go along with whatever sounds good to you.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus">Christopher Columbus</a>' discovery of the Americas was pretty much because of this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">Contrary to urban legend</a>, both Columbus and the people he asked to fund him were perfectly well aware that the world was round and that, theoretically, one could reach Asia by going westward. However, the Earth's circumference was well-known to be such that a cross-globe journey would be <em>ridiculously impractical</em> with the technology of the day. Columbus thought he could do it because he badly miscalculated how big the Earth was (he thought the Atlantic was a little larger than it actually was, but didn't know about the existence of the Pacific). He persuaded Isabella of Spain to finance his journey, and did indeed find land where he expected it to be - it's just that said land was not actually Asia, but a giant landmass about halfway between Europe and Asia that no European knew existed before Columbus ran into it because he thought Asia would be there.
</li><li> On May 12th of 2017, a powerful Ransomware virus called WannaCrypt or WannaCry hit thousands of computers around the world, locking their files away and forcing users to pay to obtain a key or lose their files forever. That very same day, malware researcher Marcus Hutchkins, known by the Twitter handle @MalwareTechBlog, was examining the program and noticed it regularly tried to ping a non-registered URL. Hutchkins purchased that URL's domain name for $10.69 in hopes of simply tracking the virus. Instead, it turned out to be the virus' killswitch and slowed down the spread enough for broader countermeasures to be deployed.
</li><li> The origins of gunpowder are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a>, but it is popularly attributed to being accidentally created by Taoist alchemists in an attempt to formulate an immortality elixir.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> says that this trope is exploited when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> hires people. He says that applicants being Nintendo fans already can actually hurt their chances of being hired, the justification being that people who don't have any preconceptions about what Nintendo games are or should be like will have an easier time bringing new and innovative ideas to the table. Miyamoto brought this up in an interview about a year after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, a game whose radical reimaginings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Zelda</a></em> conventions are credited in large part to bringing in a lot of fresh blood who had no compunctions about questioning why things were done in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> way before. Incidentally, Eiji Aonuma, the current manager of the <em>Zelda</em> series, had never played a video game before when he was first hired by Nintendo, which probably inspired them to take that approach later on.
</li><li> In the 2018 Winter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>, the winner of the women's "Super-G" (a time-trial of downhill skiing) was Ester Ledecká, who specializes in <em>snowboarding</em>. Because of her inexperience, she ended up taking an atypical route that turned out to be slightly faster than what the experts thought was ideal, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">edged out the expected gold medalist by one-hundredth of a second</a>. This was so unexpected that the main US network covering the games <a class="urllink" href="https://screengrabber.deadspin.com/how-nbc-flubbed-its-super-g-coverage-reported-the-wron-1823104438">completely missed it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> She went on to become the first person to win two gold medals in the same Olympics using different types of snow-traversing gear.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed</a> by Ken Silverman, the creator of the Build engine on which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em> is based. When he made it open source, he expected a hardware-accelerated port to come soon after; instead, all he found was angry people calling whoever asked for such a port an ignorant and claiming "it was common knowledge" that a hardware-accelerated Build port could not exist. Ken Silverman then proceeded to make it himself, naming it Polymost. On release, he quipped that if those angry people were right in calling others ignorant, then he had to be the most ignorant of all, because not only he kept claiming it was possible, but he actually proved it was.
</li><li> As a science-inclined saying goes:
<div class="indent"> "Most groundbreaking discoveries aren't made by scientists painstakingly going over their notes and eventually shouting 'Eureka!' as they discover new knowledge. They're made by a single scientist conducting a routine experiment going '... that's not what was supposed to happen.'
</div></li><li> In the 1970s, British Rail were looking to solve issues relating to trains frequently derailing, and their head of research decided to recruit someone from the aeronautics field to try and get some fresh input. The job went to Alan Wickens, someone who at his interview specifically said he had no interest in or knowledge of the design of railway bogies; he later discovered that this was <em>precisely</em> why he was hired, so as to get a fresh pair of eyes on the issue.
</li><li> Exploited by Douglas "Wrong Way" Corrigan, who claimed to have managed to fly across the Atlantic Ocean from America to Ireland without knowing he was doing it until he looked down about three-quarters of the way to Ireland. Corrigan, who had formerly worked as a mechanic for Charles Lindbergh's Trans-Atlantic flight, had actually dreamed of following in his hero's footsteps. However, the home-modified plane in which he had hoped to carry out the flight was deemed so unsafe by the Bureau of Air Commerce that they would only approve flights within the continental United States. Thus, while carrying out a flight plan that should have taken him from New York to California, Corrigan disappeared while flying <em>eastwards</em> off Floyd Bennett Field, stating that the weather would have made it impossible for a more direct take-off route. Upon arrival in Dublin, he claimed to have followed the wrong end of his cockpit compass, and thus had gone east instead of west. Corrigan's safe landing was followed up by his immediate arrest and his plane was thereafter packed into a crate for a long voyage back to New York by cargo ship (the Irish court forbade Corrigan from flying home). While few actually believed Corrigan's story, which he maintained until his death, his daring won him many admirers at a time when the United States was reeling badly from the effects of the Great Depression.
