Sometimes a cousin or two will be thrown into the mix. This trope, nephewism (coined by Josh Fruhlinger of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/TheComicsCurmudgeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/TheComicsCurmudgeon">The Comics Curmudgeon</a></em>) usually occurs when a character's parents are <em>completely</em> absent (as in, not part of the story in any way), missing, secretly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, or established as dead.
</p><p>It's an easy way to graft characters to an already-existing dramatic family, and to give your old characters (and hence the viewers) an emotional attachment to them. The advantage for the writer might be that one's expected to be more distant from aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews than it is from parents and children. It also lets them avoid having to depict a youthful protagonist with secrets as constantly lying to their actual <em>parents</em> about what they've been doing on the sly.

If it's an adventure story, expect the aunt/uncle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">to be keeping secrets about the parents</a>, or who/what their niece/nephew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">really is</a>. Also expect them to die fairly early on in the story to get the hero motivated.
</p><p>And speaking of adventure stories, if Bob has special powers to be used in his upcoming adventure, then his aunt and/or uncle may also be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents">Muggle Foster Parents</a>.
</p><p>This trope can also be used in reverse, to apply to a person besieged with nieces and nephews in their life. In these cases it is often used to allow plots in which canonically single characters fulfill a parental role without significantly changing their character. Strangely enough, nephews in these situations often look and act like clones of their uncles, in defiance of everything we know about heredity.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Peter Parker has Aunt May and Uncle Ben; in almost all versions, they're his main role models for as long as he can remember.
</li><li> In the comics his parents turned out to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> agents who were killed by the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a>. In the Ultimate universe, they were geneticists killed when Eddie Brock Sr. experimented on himself with the anti-cancer Symbiote the Parkers and Brocks created, becoming the first Venom and crashing the plane they were on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">The 1990s animated series</a> had Peter Parker's parents being spies, who were actually not dead (as per the full effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a> that hit the show), but in Russia.
</li><li> The trope also kind of applies to Mary Jane Watson, who for the first two decades of her fictional existence only had her Aunt Anna as a relative. It was then revealed that her mother is dead and that she was very much estranged from her abusive father. (The 1987 wedding ceremony by the way was performed by MJ's Uncle Spencer.)
</li></ul></li><li> Benjamin Grimm a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">the Thing</a> was raised by his Uncle Jacob. It was often implied that he was also raised by Jacob's wife, Ben's Aunt Petunia, until a 1980s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a> story revealed that Petunia was an attractive brunette, much younger than her husband, and about Ben's age.
</li><li> The only known relative of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> supporting character Rick Jones is his aunt. Also, although she is rarely brought up, a few stories and adaptations mention Bruce being partially raised by his aunt after his father kills his mother (and eventually gets arrested for it.)
</li><li> In the very early Batman comics, Bruce was raised by his aunt and uncle after the death of his parents. (At the time Alfred was not the Wayne family's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">Old Retainer</a>, he only signed on as Bruce's butler after he became an adult.) Then they decided to Retcon that and had Alfred act as Bruce's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">surrogate father</a> after the death of his parents. His aunt and uncle were pretty much wiped from existence.
<ul><li> The New 52 reintroduces Uncle Philip and Aunt Agatha. Curiously, though, they're now relations of Bruce's <em>mother</em>, not his father, and, more pertinently, Philip is more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> (or at least a highly shady executive in his brother-in-law's company, whom Bruce does not seem to think very highly of).
</li><li> Bruce DOES have another maternal uncle in Jacob Kane, father of his cousin Kate Kane (who's Batwoman), but the two rarely interact and aren't implied to have ever been close at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a> Wally West considers his aunt Iris West and his uncle by marriage Barry Allen as his parents more than his biological ones.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Duck family</a>: Scrooge McDuck is uncle to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>, who is uncle to Huey, Dewey, &amp; Louie. Not a parent among 'em. Scrooge's sister Hortense and husband Quackmore Duck are eventually revealed to be the parents of Donald and Della Duck, the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. They were first depicted long after the other characters were, and, in any case, are obscure enough to have made no appearances outside of Disney Comics.
<ul><li> Huey, Dewey, and Louie are a particularly odd case in that, in their first appearance in 1938, their parents were mentioned and they were explicitly just visiting. They never left, and by 1942 Donald was shown onscreen listing them as dependents on his tax forms. Some German Donald Duck fans have even come up with a theory that in Duckburg it is simply the done thing to have children raised by their uncles (or aunts) instead of their parents, and coined the technical term <em>Veronkelung</em> ("uncling") for it. It certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily">runs in the family</a> — although Scrooge's parents didn't die until he was an adult, Carl Barks, Keno Don Rosa, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> all depict Scrooge leaving Scotland for America at age 13, spending his teenage years being raised, employed, and trained by his own uncle!
</li><li> It's a trend — Disney prefers niblings to children. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> has two nephews, Morty and Ferdie, Minnie has two nieces, Millie and Melody, and even Pete has two nephews, Pierino and Pieretto. Daisy Duck meanwhile has three nieces, named April, May, and June. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> nephew named Gilbert. In the comics, Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander, and Fethry Duck also have a nephew each. The Beagle Boys have both a set of three nephews and three nieces, while the Phantom Blot has only three nephews.

Early on in the comic it's just accepted as fact that Sonic's parents were casualties of Dr. Robotnik's enslavement program the same as everyone else's parents, and Chuck was for whatever reason the important relative. Later on it explains that Chuck is, in fact, the reason he has Nephewism in the first place; when he was forced to test his roboticizer on his gravely injured brother, he discovered that the machines his patients turned into had no will of their own (which made it rather unviable in its intended purpose of extending the lives of the injured and infirm). This sent him spiraling into depression and he abandoned the project, allowing Robotnik to swoop in and steal it for his takeover scheme.

They use the terms "uncle" and "nephew" due to their 78-year age difference. Prior to this Frodo had been living with various other relatives; justified in that Hobbits are fascinated by genealogy and tend to have large families. (Bilbo and Frodo are somewhat unusual in that each of them is an only child.) This means they have <em>lots</em> of relatives and know <em>exactly</em> how they're related to each of them; it's pointed out in the story itself (by yet another relative) that Frodo is Bilbo's "first <em>and</em> second cousin, once removed either way".

</li><li> A common plot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> series was for the protagonist to be palmed off with an aunt and uncle while the parents made a flimsy excuse to disappear — usually just long enough for the protagonist to encounter the ghost/vampire/werewolf/mummy/whatever horror made up the subject of the book. The best (or worst) example is probably <em>Werewolf Skin</em>, where Alex apparently has to live with his aunt and uncle indefinitely because he even starts going to the local school. And we never once hear where his parents are!
</li><li> Anthony Horowitz's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a></em> series, does this... <em>twice</em>.

</li><li> The Finneys of Sharon Creech's novels <em>Walk Two Moons</em> and <em>Absolutely Normal Chaos</em> seem to take in cousins as necessary: in the latter book, Carl Ray is looking for a job, and in the former, Ben's mother is explicitly out of the picture due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being in a mental institution</span>. Where his father is in this isn't made clear.

<ul><li> Prince Caspian was also raised by his uncle, Miraz, who'd secretly murdered his father to claim the crown. While Caspian's paternal grandfather had presumably died when Caspian's father became king, the absence of his mother or of his maternal grandparents is not explained. (However, Caspian's tutor says that Miraz didn't take on the title of king, having previously been known as "Lord Protector", until after the queen died, so Caspian's mother is presumably dead.)

Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> brings <em>his</em> niece, Artemis, to the team, which is when Robin lampshades it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Artemis isn't really Green Arrow's niece; she just doesn't want the Team to know who her real family is</span>.

For that matter, we could throw in Red Arrow and Guardian, who only think they're nephew and uncle: they're actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both clones of the original Roy Harper</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingLeonardoAndHisShortSubjects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingLeonardoAndHisShortSubjects">King Leonardo and His Short Subjects</a></em>: King Leonardo has his twin nephews, Duke and Earl.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears">Care Bears</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shreeky from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s">the 80's series</a> is first introduced when she comes to visit her Uncle No Heart at one point. Shreeky's "visit" ends up being the remainder of the series (or else she just visits No Heart frequently). Her parents are never mentioned.
</li><li> Wonderheart Bear on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsWelcomeToCareALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsWelcomeToCareALot">Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot</a></em> lives with her uncle Tenderheart. No parents are ever mentioned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCareBearsAdventureInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCareBearsAdventureInWonderland">The Care Bears: Adventure in Wonderland</a></em>, the pretext for getting the Care-a-Lot crew involved with the plot is that Swift Heart Rabbit is the niece of Wonderland's White Rabbit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em> has Ajax, Charles, and Mambo's Aunt Bernice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later, their Aunt Beverly</span> stay with the family as a maternal figure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Cadance and Prince Blueblood are apparently Princesses Celestia and Luna's niece and nephew, respectively. How this works out, since Celestia and Luna are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">well over 1,000 years old</a>, is never explained. Most fans just say that Cadance is adopted (the canon side-story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwilightSparkleAndTheCrystalHeartSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwilightSparkleAndTheCrystalHeartSpell">Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell</a></em> states that Cadance was an orphan found by some village-folk). The season three finale supports that, as it shows that regular ponies can <em>become</em> princesses without having to be related to the existing royalty. In Blueblood's case, most fans claimed that he is indeed a nephew of Celestia and Luna, but he's so far descended from them that it's easier to just forget all the "great-great-great..." and just call him "nephew". In "The Ticket Master," Rarity explicitly states that she hopes to meet Celestia's nephew at the Grand Galloping Gala. It does leave open the great-great-great... possibility, but sets them more solidly as relatives.
</li><li> Scootaloo's parents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad">usually busy</a> so she's left in the hooves of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">two aunts</a>, Lofty Love and Holiday.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is set over the course of a summer that protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins">Dipper and Mabel</a> spend visiting their great-uncle, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Grunkle Stan</a>" (and later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their other great-uncle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Ford</a></span>). Dipper and Mabel's parents are sometimes mentioned but never seen, save for their arms in the opening episode.
</li><li> Huey, Dewey, and Louie more or less created this trope. In the cartoons, when they're not living with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuackPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuackPack">Uncle Donald</a>, they're living with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">Great-Uncle Scrooge</a>.
<ul><li> It gets more complicated. Scrooge is also Donald's uncle, so he's experienced nephewism at least twice over.
</li><li> The old Donald Duck short which first introduced the triplets explained that they are the sons of Donald's sister. She has never appeared in any Disney media, and has never even been mentioned outside of that short... until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>, that is. The pilot movie implies that Donald's twin sister Della <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">died or went missing</a> on an adventure with Donald and Scrooge, leading to Donald becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a>, and his subsequent estrangement from Scrooge prior to the beginning of the series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's eventually revealed to have gotten stranded on the moon before her kids even <em>hatched</em>.</span>
</li><li> In the same series, Lena is much like the triplets in that only known family is her aunt Magica. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes a very dark subversion when it turns out Lena is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Living Shadow</a> to whom Magica is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">Truly Single Parent</a>, a relation neither wants to acknowledge—Lena because Magica <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">is a terrible guardian</a>, Magica because she doesn't see Lena as family, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">or even a real person</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Early Disney shorts and media assigned a pair of nephews to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>. Morty and Ferdy's parents are never mentioned. They appear in some children's books, but otherwise nowadays seem to have vanished from existence.
</li><li> Sarah and James from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam">Fireman Sam</a></em> were this for the first five seasons, with Sam himself being their only known relative. In season six, their parents, Charlie and Bronwyn, were introduced.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em> cartoon plays with this trope by inflicting nephewism on Lydia's parents. Thing is, they don't actually <em>have</em> a nephew — it's Beetlejuice, pretending to be Lydia's "cousin B.J." so he can be part of family events. Charles and Delia both seem kind of confused by this, but never actually question the matter; they each seem to assume that B.J. is the other's nephew.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElChavoAnimado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElChavoAnimado">El Chavo Animado</a></em>, Popis is Doña Florindas niece and seems to live permanently in La Vecindad (her character was upgraded from the original live-action series as La Chilindrina was unable to appear due to the fact that the actress who played her, María Antonieta de las Nieves, holds the copyright).
</li><li> Played for a one-off gag in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode "Stanley S. SquarePants". Mr. Krabs reveals he has three nephews who solve mysteries, whom he tells to go solve the mystery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">why they didn't get hired at the Krusty Krab</a>.
</li><li> Gargamel takes care of his niece Denisa in several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>. Unlike her uncle, Denisa is actually a nice good-hearted girl, much to her uncle's annoyance.
</li><li> Mixadel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels">Mixels</a></em> appears to live with his cousin and uncle, with his parents never mentioned and his uncle treating him like a second son more than a nephew.
</li><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a></em> lives under the care of his ghost uncles in some continuities. Wendy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Good Little Witch</a> also lives with her unfriendly witch aunts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InchHighPrivateEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InchHighPrivateEye">Inch High, Private Eye</a> is assisted by his niece Lori. Completely subverted in his only comic book appearance (Hanna-Barbera Fun-In #14, Gold Key, October 1974) where Lori is Inch's secretary and she has the hots for him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PunkyBrewster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PunkyBrewster">Punky Brewster</a></em>: In the episode "Punky the Heiress", Punky finds out she has an aunt and an uncle. But they're a couple of ne'er-do-wells—servants of Chester Henderson and his estate—who use Punky to embezzle the fortune of Henderson's granddaughter.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> when the characters are telling their tragic (fake) backstories. Raven's backstory parodies Spider-Man's. She lived with two old people and the man later died of natural causes in his 90s. Raven refers to them as just "old people", but the man's grave says "Uncle" (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">only</a></em> "Uncle").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Foofur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Foofur">Foofur</a></em>: The puppy Rocki is under the care of her Uncle Foofur. In one episode is shown that her father (Foofur's brother) is a sailor and that's the reason why she's with her uncle.
</li><li> Tito Dick from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNutshack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNutshack">The Nutshack</a></em> is Phil and Jack's uncle. Phil has lived with him for a long time (the theme song explains that Dick raised Phil), but Jack begins living with him in the first episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">Tripping the Rift</a></em>, Chode is under the care of his nephew Whip, who is 15-16. Of course, the fact that Chode is a purple monster and Whip a reptilian chameleon-like creature makes the relation kind of weird.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero</a></em> lives with his aunt and uncle while his parents spend most of the series trapped on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>.
