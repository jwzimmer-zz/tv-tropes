This is notoriously common in RPGs, with characters wearing the same armor continuously for weeks. Often characters even sleep in full battle gear. Some RPGs downplay this by having a character in just a breastplate, possibly with shoulder pauldrons and some other odd pieces. Still pretty uncomfortable pajamas.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> history, while armor was not as unreasonably heavy or inflexible as in popular myth, wearing it for extended periods was far from comfortable. It took time (and in many cases, assistance) to don and remove, and the bulk or stiffness of certain armors restricted one's range of motion to a greater or lesser degree. It could be noisy, what with the clattering of plates and jingling of mail. The weight would tax one's endurance and make one's neck and shoulders hurt after a long time. It could get very hot and sweaty, especially when incorporating a helmet and/or significant padding. Meanwhile, metal parts would become painfully hot or cold to the touch depending on whether you were under scorching sun or in freezing temperatures. Rust was a constant threat to iron or steel armor in the days before stainless steel, so it had to be regularly polished. If you did that right, then protective oil from your greasy mail haubergon would tend to stain you and your clothes. Leather or textile components—including the arming clothes underneath—could soak up sweat or water and begin to stink. In battle, it could become extremely unhygienic: in addition to sweat, people bled inside their armor, and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure">relieved themselves</a>, both because you can't take bathroom breaks in the midst of battle and because sudden terror can *ahem* <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">loosen the bowels</a>. Armor could be deformed or pierced by a mace, axe, polearm, or hammer, causing serious injuries for the wearer. In that case the affected pieces would have to be stripped off the wearer on the way to the surgeon's tent.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Armor could be <em>really</em> expensive, so it had to be treated carefully even when not damaged in a given battle. As the European ironworking industry gradually expanded to meet the increased demands for iron-based armor and weaponry<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0eibt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0eibt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0eibt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Europe was ridiculously over-iron-ed by world standards even in the 18th century, thanks to technological innovations in smelting and steelmaking. They didn't even have 100 million people, but they had at least a million guns and 10,000 artillery pieces. This is because Europe had been at war with itself practically non-stop for the better part of a millennium, somehow without a single continent-spanning Empire coming into being as a result of it (as per the world norm)</span> standard-issue sets of plate became more common but remained a significant investment. Therefore, after a military campaign, tournament, or training exercise, armor would be removed, cleaned thoroughly, repaired as necessary, and packed away for safekeeping until the next engagement. People hardly ever wore armor when they didn't need to: they wore it when they had to protect themselves (or at least appear in a military parade), and they took it off as soon as they didn't need it. On the rare occasions where they did sleep in it out of dire necessity, you can bet that it wasn't much fun.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope doesn't normally apply to certain types of armor that are designed to be less fully protective and easier to wear in civilian life: certain people do actually wear a light-duty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofVest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofVest">Bulletproof Vest</a> all day, and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> some people wore doublets made of mail or small plates sewn inside of fabric that acted like low-profile stab-proof vests. The trope proper is about characters relaxing in the kind of equipment that real people wouldn't wear unless they were on military duty, although the aforementioned concealed armors may qualify as downplayed examples if their wearers even sleep in them too.
</p><p>It may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in the case of magical armor; the enchantments may not only increase defense, but also make it more comfortable than normal armor. Another common justification is that that they literally <em>can't</em> take it off, either because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume">Clingy Costume</a>, or because the wearer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">Dark Lord on Life Support</a> and the armor is keeping them alive. Perhaps the most mundane and realistic explanation is that the wearer is camping in hostile territory or being targeted by assassins, so that they dare not remove it for any length of time until the threat is gone. It may also be justified for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">Man in the Machine</a> if they're designed with extended occupancy in mind, incorporating things like climate control and sanitary waste removal. Often a symptom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a>. 24-Hour Armor combined with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> may result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoogieKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoogieKnights">Boogie Knights</a>.

</p><p>If someone spends time in the vicinity of a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a> without knowing its true nature, their working assumption will probably be that it's a person wearing 24-Hour Armor.

<ul><li> Mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, with people wondering how the heck Al can wear that bulky suit of armor 24/7. Of course, we all know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">the reason</a> for this...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> shows that Guts rarely takes his armor off - which makes some sense, because he is constantly at threat of being attacked by demons. Other than that, it's usually averted, as most of the armor-wearing cast members only do so in battle.
<ul><li> Ever since Azan was kicked out of the Holy See he has kept his helmet on at all times, possibly out of shame, and was even once seen sleeping in full plate armor. He even <em>eats</em> while wearing the helmet.
</li><li> Griffith hasn't been shown without armor since his incarnation. He doesn't wear his helmet when not in battle, and was seen without his gauntlets once, but that's it.
</li></ul></li><li> Erza in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> is almost always in armor. She only wears something else on rare occasions when she wants to look nice, once while in a construction uniform, or to sleep/shower. In her case she feels unsafe without it after being a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> child slave</span>, and has the special power to switch between sets at will. However her usual attire is just a single light breastplate over a regular clothes. She only puts on the elaborate huge head to toe armor sets during battle.
</li><li> Laios in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is hardly ever seen out of his armor. He even sleeps in it occasionally!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>, Lucia Raregroove, seems to prefer armor to regular clothing, he's without it when he first breaks out of prison and has to steal some random dudes outfit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">and apparently he sleeps naked</a>), but otherwise he always has a suit of armor on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inuyasha wears a special kimono, the Robe of the Fire Rat, that doubles as full body armor. On the rare occasion he removes any of it, it's only the top outer layer and only when his human companions need protection from things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-youkai</a> can resist. Otherwise, he sleeps in it and on one occasion was seen scrubbing himself in a pool of water... while still wearing it.
</li><li> Sesshoumaru never removes his armor. On one occasion he's badly injured, his armor is smashed and he's forced lie in one spot for a day or two; he still doesn't remove the armor. The only time he doesn't have armor is when he assumes his true form as a giant dog demon. This is more or less shape-shifting and his clothes disappear and reappear when he changes back and forth from human to dog.
</li><li> Kouga has never been seen without his armor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf">Dragon Half</a></em>, little Pia's parents told her never to take off her armor. She never does, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">not even when diving into a lake</a>. Needless to say, she didn't float.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba">Yaiba</a></em>: Onimaru Takeshi is always seen with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryImpracticalArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryImpracticalArmor">Scary Impractical Armor</a> on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em>, Eucliwood always wears her armor, as it's necessary for her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">limit her power</a>.
</li><li> Aside from Masamune and Kojuro in some scenes (and anybody who happens to be injured and bedridden), the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em> are always dressed ready for battle. It becomes pretty ridiculous when characters are shown to take their shoes off indoors, but keep their helmets on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage">The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage</a></em>, the Valkyrie Waltraute never removes her armor, and thinks doing so would be a blasphemy. The other Valkyries are more relaxed about wearing armor. When Waltraute is married to Jack Elvan, she eventually, nervously, gives him permission to remove it, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller">they are interrupted</a> and she changes her mind.
</li><li> The warrior Heracles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has always been seen in full-body armor and a helmet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> both Saiyan (except for Goku) and members of Frieza's army (that for a long time included also the Saiyan) are rarely seen without armor, even when they've become so strong that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">it could as well be paper</a>. Shown most clearly by Vegeta, who actually needs a reason <em>not to</em> (when he's in a healing tank he has to be naked, he didn't have any armor available when Frieza and King Cold came to Earth, and was forbidden by the rules of the Tenkaichi).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> we get to see a Saiyan from another universe, who doesn't wear the standard armor of Frieza's army. Instead he wears a different pattern of armor, that Vegeta quickly identifies as Saiyan traditional armor before they joined Frieza's organization.

Best shown by Aiolia, who spent most of his early appearances without armor (or even indications he had one) until near the end of the Sanctuary Arc, when he was given a mission and stopped being seen armorless, and confirmed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiyaSoulOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiyaSoulOfGold">Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold</a></em>, where the Gold Saints are seen multiple times out of combat or formal situations and thus don't wear their armors.
<ul><li> And amazingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> with the goddess Athena: while the myth has her wearing a helmet and a cuirass all the time, she isn't seen wearing her armor <em>at all</em> until the end of the Hades Arc. This is made even more notable by how most of the other gods who appear are actually shown wearing armor almost all the time when the myth doesn't attribute them having any except for Hades' helmet.
</li><li> Played straight by almost all the inhabitants of the Sanctuary, who wear leather armor usually composed by a protection for the chest (usually only the left side) and both shoulders, plus often a helmet, with metallic armors being reserved for special jobs outside the Sanctuary. The only known exceptions are Aiolia and Aiolos, who wear a protection for the entire chest with metal shoulders, Shaina and Marin, who wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini">Chainmail Bikinis</a>, the Pope (or those impersonating him), who wear ceremonial robes that in all versions include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Cool Helmet</a> and in one armored shoulder pads (and <em>may</em> hide some other armor worn under it), Phaeton, who wears what may be a Cloth or just some very decorative metal armor, and minister Gigars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaEpisodeG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaEpisodeG">Lithos Crysallis and Garan</a>, who don't wear any-the rule seems to be that warriors must be armored at all times (Gigars was a minister and Lithos and Garan are servants.

</li><li> Back when they were training to become Saints, Seiya and Shun used to wear the most minimalistic version of the Sanctuary soldiers' armor (with extensible chains in Shun's case), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> in Seiya's case by being training at the Sanctuary and becoming a common soldier being what would happen if he failed the training but survived and for Shun as it was the local training uniform (the only trainee who wouldn't wear it at Andromeda Island was June, who, being a woman, wore instead a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini">Chainmail Bikini</a>).

When asked by his companions if he'd feel more comfortable without it, Goblin Slayer bluntly tells them that he's vastly more comfortable in the knowledge that if he was suddenly attacked, he would be safe from goblin weapons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Considering how sadistically-clever goblins tend to be with traps and ambushes, this is totally justified.</a>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s suits of armor sometimes employed this trope. Originally, due to his heart condition, he had to wear a chest piece under his shirt which doubled as his chest plate. Other versions were skintight, allowing him to wear full suits under his clothes. When he's equipped with Extremis, the armor is expressly a part of his body. Most armors also come equipped with a music playlist for long flights, or even noise cancellation equipment if he wants to take a nap. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> also had this type of armor during his "cyborg" period.

<ul><li> Captain America's regular costume includes something like chainmail, and he wears it like a second skin. Partly justified by his peak human strength.

Because he's a devout followers of the Drowned God, though, he considered drowning a holy way to die.

For this reason, as well as the fact that it is much easier to conceal than normal armor, it is highly prized by spies, diplomats, martial artists, and anyone else who might want the protection of armor without the hassle of a cumbersome, conspicuous suit of plated metal.

</li><li> A particular amusing case is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Jagen</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia">Mystery of the Emblem</a></em> and its remake. He's still dressed in full, relatively heavy-looking battle armor like he was in the preceding games... except here he is in poor health, is just a tactician and advisor, and thus cannot and does not fight <em>at all</em>. For <em>Mystery</em> it may be enforced by technological limitations with limited space for superfluous portraits on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SNES">SNES</a> cartridge, but <em>New Mystery</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> game and doesn't have the same excuse at all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though it does allow for one particular moment towards the late beginning of the second DS game where Jagen threatens General Lang with a duel, causing Lang to run away</span>.

Whenever your character is in bed (whether sleeping or doing other things one does in bed), the game removes whatever you have equipped in your armor/clothing slot and blacks out the general area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:

</li><li> Ganondorf is also guilty of this: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, he wears the exact same armor even after the time skip (the only addition being a brand new cape). In <em>Twilight Princess</em>, he wears a different set of armor...but he's apparently worn that for <em>decades</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, while Link can change in and out of armor and other, more comfortable sets of clothes at any point, there's nothing stopping him from wearing heavy armor at all times and even when sleeping in a bed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em>, the main character wears red armor all the time, full plate mail, though it's a well-customized fit.
</li><li> Samus wears her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> even when walking around friendly bases or sitting in her ship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3">Metroid Prime 3</a></em>, though of course, if she didn't have it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">the game would be impossible from that point.</a>
<ul><li> She does wear the armor for a whole mission/game ultimately playing the trope straight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> her suit appears to be of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> variety and she can summon or dismiss it at will. She's wearing the skintight Zero Suit underneath, and we also see her wearing ordinary clothes in some scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on the class, a character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> can be wearing the most outrageously huge armor you've ever seen, but still be able to disco your face off.

<ul><li> Of course, this doesn't apply to the roleplaying crowd on <em>WoW</em>. They blow hard-earned gold on random pieces of low-level cloth armor (which goes for quite a lot on the AH due to appropriate appearance) just to avert this trope.
</li><li> The Armory system <em>encourages</em> your character to wear his best armor at all times, even when sleeping in an inn. Your equipped items are available for all the world to see, and if you're wearing a flimsy nightgown instead of your Item Level 359 Epic Breastplate of Major Pain Infliction, the other players will call you names, kick you out of dungeon groups inside of the first 5 seconds, etc..
<ul><li> But if a player still insists on roleplaying, a Druid can just say he sleeps in his Bear/Cat/Moonkin form. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">His robes/armor simply disappear until he changes back.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed by the Transmogrification system, which allows you to restyle any piece of armor as long as it's the same class (that is, plate can look like any other piece of plate armor)... for a price. And the most recent version of the system allows you to <em>hide</em> any piece of armor except the pants— meaning you can pull off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan</a> look if you want to now. It just doesn't <em>look</em> like you're wearing all that plate... just a set of (quite possibly scanty) leggings.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> Cecil goes to sleep wearing his armor in an early cutscene. There are two reasons he has to wear it: One, he feels as though he must, because he wants to atone and we only get to see his face after he does so and two, it's implied it's actually strapped to his <em>skin</em>.
<ul><li> This is actually a plot point in The After Years. Since Kain always wore concealing Dragoon armor in the first game, very few if any people recognize him without it, even in his hometown where they've been wishing he'd return for years, though the fact that he hasn't been seen in years also helps (a few former party members either do recognize him or at least find him familiar, but he typically deflects the conversation until the reveal.) Likewise for Golbez. Since he was always in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTyrant">Tin Tyrant</a> armor in the first game, nobody except for one character very importantly connected to him, has any idea who he is until he reveals it, although again, like with Kain, none of the characters have seen him in 17 years either.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, it is quite amusing to see your characters lying in bed during a cutscene, wearing full Dragoon or Dark Knight armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Master Chief John-117 very rarely takes off his armor. In the games, he's only had his helmet off four times total, and his full armor off once, at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, he occasionally takes it off, but he's spent so much time in it, his skin looks bleached, due to lack of exposure to the sun.
<ul><li> The series has gone to rather absurd lengths to keep ol' John as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a>. Case in point: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> starts off with the MJOLNIR armor worn during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">first game</a> having been junked just before the MC is going to an award ceremony in his honor. His choice of attire for this prestigious public occasion? A <em>new</em> set of MJOLNIR armor, with the helmet clamped securely on at <em>all</em> times. At this rate, either <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Haloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Haloid">Haloid</a></em> is canon, or he's cripplingly shy.

</div><ul><li> This is all justified though, as he and the other Spartans literally feel as if they are without their skin when taking off their armor, simply because the armor forms so perfectly onto them that they don't even feel the difference, except for the fact that armor multiplies their strength, resistance, etc. And since they've had it on so long, when they take it off, they feel extremely slow, powerless, and vulnerable even with all their already superhuman features.
</li></ul></li><li> Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunner</a>, be they warrior, builder, scientist, etc. wore a suit of armor for their entire lives. Justified, since it's the reason they live so long and don't need to sleep, and contains their own personal AI with a massive store of knowledge. At one point, some females are seen wearing ceremonial garb, but even then, it's only colorful cloth suspended over their actual armor.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>. Not only do characters take off their armor to sleep, most of them sleep in their underwear. Which does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear">not</a></em> include a bra for Riesz or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Angela</a>. If using an emulator, you can even turn off the right sprite layer to see how they sleep. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">2020 remake</a> plays it straight however - staying at an inn will give you a brief scene of your party in bed still dressed in their normal attire, which is particularly absurd for Duran, and doubly so if he's using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeletonsInTheCoatCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeletonsInTheCoatCloset">Duelist outfit</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> zig-zags with this trope. First, the game features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment">Informed Equipment</a>, so the player doesn't see the armor that the party picks up. The most knightly character, Frog, wears a breastplate as seen in character illustrations, so this is less severe than full-body mail would be. Finally, Lucca sleeps without her helmet, making her case an aversion.
</li><li> Steiner from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, much to the amusement of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue">main character</a>.
<ul><li> Contrast with Beatrix, his fellow military officer and rival, who wears no armor whatsoever.

Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the depths of the manual,</a> it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> that he rarely takes it off because he enjoys the empowered, manly feeling wearing armor gives him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> has it both ways. Shepard, Ashley, and Kaidan wear exceptionally bulky armor when out on a mission, but automatically change to a much lighter uniform when on your home ship. Members of alien races, like Garrus and Wrex,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cbak');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4cbak" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cbak');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, Krogan Battlemasters don't get to be Wrex's age without being excessively paranoid. He probably doesn't take it off to <em>bathe</em>. (It's likely that he doesn't bathe at all).</span> still seem to wear their armor all the time. In Tali's case, it's implied that taking off her armor in an Earthlike environment would be fatal.
<ul><li> In Mass Effect 2 it's revealed that <em>all</em> Quarians have to wear armor all the time due to their weak immune system, even in their own environments; so it's likely that, yes, Quarians may literally eat, sleep, bathe and even... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">Well, you know</a>... In their armor, which Tali uses to troll Liara at one point. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>' shows that they can also drink alcohol through their armor.

</li><li> Their high tech suits are also specifically designed to be lived in, with lots of conveniences like evironment control and neuro stimulators to help them simulate the experience of touching each other. They're also made of a thinner flexible material unlike the bulky plate that other characters wear. The suits have become part of their culture.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> has Garrus wearing lighter clothing if you invite him up for a cuddle in a female romance plot. It's pretty much the day wear you see regular turians walking around in. Krogan also wear regular clothing, but it looks a lot like their armor.
</li><li> And Shepard sees fit to wear their armor and weapons to formal situations, like for being appointed to the position of Spectre. Some people try to justify this with the claim that full combat armor is the unofficial Spectre equivalent to dress uniform. It kinda makes sense, as Spectres are all about being badass, so being seen wearing armor all the time, making them look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">always prepared</a> would probably only enforce that. The books seem to confirm this. Saren is always seen in his armor no matter what, however a krogan battle master doesn't wear any armor when meeting with his employer.
</li><li> For heavier armor too, it's important to note that the in-game justification is that nanotechnology allows for highly effective modular and self-repairing plates (or some such) as well as that most of the protection actually comes from very tiny force field emitters. Thus their armor is less 'armor' and more hardened space suits than anything else. Wrex gets both a handwave and a justification in that he fought a battle with a rival mercenary... for several days <em>straight</em>.
</li><li> It gets worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>. Some armors come with the extra special function of completely non-removable helmets. This does not, however, prohibit Shepard from drinking or embracing former loved ones <em>right through their helmet</em>. <em>3</em> has the same issue in some cases, such as giving a romanced Jack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss">"Shut Up" Kiss</a> at the end of the Grissom Academy level, but at least you can switch your helmet from "Default" to "Off In Conversations", which prevents that problem at the expense of a bit of immersion-straining.
<ul><li> This trope is both played straight and inverted in Mass Effect 2. The inventory system from the first game is gone, so all of your squadmates go out in whatever they wear on the <em>Normandy</em>. So Zaeed, Grunt, and Garrus (except for the aforementioned romance scene) always wear full armor. On the other extreme, Jack goes into battle essentially topless.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Bioware can't seem to make up their mind about this trope. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, anyone equipped with armor wears it 24/7. The player can manually give party members normal clothes (or strip them to their underwear), but there is no practical reason to ever do so.
<ul><li> The armor goes away for a moment when the main character and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> decide to do some sparring. It's back on when they wake up the next morning. Because the first thing anyone does after sex is put on their armor, then lie back down, right?
</li><li> It does make an effort with some of the NPCs though, the landsmeet members for instance are all in normal clothing when you meet them in the city and full armor at the landsmeet itself. Arl Eamon wears normal clothes normally, fancy chainmail to the landsmeet and a suit of full plate when preparing for battle.
</li><li> There's a scene early on when the main character wakes up without wearing armor. An entire conversation goes by this way, and when it's time to hand control over to the player there's a scene shift and the character is back to wearing full armor again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> plays this mostly the same way but with one exception: Hawke will wear casual clothes while at home (Gamlen's house or the Hawke estate). The Companions, on the other hand, will wear their armor 24/7 (except the love interests). Even then, the only ones wearing armor heavier than street clothes are Aveline and Sebastian, and the only times you see Aveline out of your party she's on the clock for the city guard.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, the player changes into plain clothes while at the Inquisition headquarters (Haven and later Skyhold). Bizarrely, on most missions where you're invited to a ball or other social event, you stay in armor, except for one story mission where you and your companions wear formal attire instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord">Overlord</a></em>. The armor never comes off, except when it's time to get jiggy wit' it. Oh <em>yeah</em>. Even then it's only <em>implied</em>. You never actually <em>see</em> the Overlord without armor.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, when one of the Arcadian soldiers got so tried of wearing his armor he got a civilian to pose as him while he lounged about.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> when your character wears Power Armor in New Reno:
<div class="indent"><strong>Hooker</strong>: OK. But no way in <em>hell</em> do you get to be on top. <br/>And: <br/><strong>Child</strong>: How do you go to the bathroom? <br/><strong>Player</strong>: Well, I go inside my suit, and then the water is recycl- <br/><strong>Child</strong>: You drink pee! You drink pee!
</div><ul><li> On the other hand, when you have sex with someone the game subverts the trope and awakens you naked (well, as naked as you can get in Fallout, anyway) with your armor close to your bed.
</li><li> The New Reno hookers will mock you no matter what you're wearing. It's just that armor gets the more amusing jabs.
</li><li> Justified in the case of Frank Horrigan. He's a cyborg supermutant whose armor also acts as a life support system. Even if he wanted to remove his armor, he probably couldn't without risking death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has a couple of chilling examples of this in its expansions:
<ul><li> <em>Dead Money</em> has Hazmat suits with a design flaw causing the latching components to seize up, trapping the wearer inside. Those unfortunate enough to be wearing the suits when the bombs fell became more or less immortal in their hermetically-sealed environment. As they lost their sanity, the Ghost People were born.
</li><li> <em>Old World Blues</em> features the Y-17 Trauma Harness, powered suit prototypes designed to be placed on an injured soldier in combat so that he could be 'walked' back to a friendly area in relative safety. Unfortunately, there were a couple of minor flaws in the Trauma Harness - namely an overly sensitive and aggressive self-defense system, the possibility of it activating without a set base to walk back to, and a lack of recognition on whether or not the inhabitant of the suit was, in fact, alive. Thus, the Big Empty is packed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">autonomous harnesses</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">ferrying around skeletons</a>.
</li><li> Not quite as chilling, Brotherhood of Steel soldiers do indeed sleep in power armor. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, however, the player must exit their power armor before sleeping. Brotherhood companion Paladin Danse presumably gets out of his power armor at bedtime if the player is romancing him, but he's apparently pretty good about getting up and putting it back on just before you wake up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> occurs over three days and two nights (<em>Episode One</em> and <em>Episode Two</em> extending this to four or five days) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">from Gordon's point of view</a>, yet he is always in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">HEV suit</a> after first acquiring it. Granted, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripleShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripleShifter">doesn't go to sleep either</a> other than by being knocked out between episodes.
<ul><li> When he reaches Black Mesa East, Eli Vance mentions getting him "out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat", but the action picks back up before that has a chance to happen.

The armor works as a sort of mobile prison, and there are systems to shut off his major organs should whoever released him find that he isn't to be controlled anymore.
<ul><li> This is actually the lore for all Marines in at least the original game. The majority of Marines are convicts serving life sentences who are fitted into armor that cannot be removed and forced into the army until they're killed.

It isn't unheard of for a player to go around in heavy armor for months on end, and short of a few instances (namely training), your minions will never change their clothing either. The active exception to this lies in the named lords, who will wear full battle kit when in the field, and suitably fancy clothing when standing around in a castle keep.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a> 2</em> with Alcatraz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Nanosuit</a>, since it's the only thing keeping him alive after his grievous wounding at the beginning of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He later discovers that the suit is compensating for the otherwise fatal injuries by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">growing into his body.</a></em></span>

</li><li> Man-Bot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomForce">Freedom Force</a></em> wears his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a> constantly.

</li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>. Your militia take a small morale penalty if made to wear their armor when not on duty, but there are no other ill-effects apart from them moving more slowly.
</li><li> Played straight in most iterations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>: saving the game involves sleeping in a bed, which means the player-character flops into bed in whatever they happen to be wearing at the time, which may include heavy armor with a full-face helmet. (Weapons, however, disappear into hammerspace, because it's pretty painful to fall on your sword even when it's sheathed.)
<ul><li> Downplayed in <em>Monster Hunter Portable 3rd</em>: taking a bath, which grants a temporary stat boost, causes the player-character to automatically doff their armor in favour of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyTowel">Modesty Towel</a>.

</div></li><li> So long as the player doesn't actively take their armor off, this is played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>. This is justified, however, because one of the perks (one of the few) of being undead seems to be never needing to sleep or have food/drink. And besides that, in the world of Dark Souls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">wearing your armor all the time is probably a good move...</a>.
</li><li> Sun King Aster in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Erenor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Erenor">Erenor</a></em> series is an example of this. Supposedly, his armor is 10 times lighter than steel, but no accounting for comfort.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria">Radiant Historia</a></em> has Alistel army commanders who have been explicitly moved to permanent desk jobs still wear full combat armor. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> example, as Alistel has such a strong military tradition it's quite possible combat gear is the uniform all the way up to the top. Granorg, by contrast, has its noncombatant governors in much less practical finery.
</li><li> It's possibly apocryphal in-universe, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2</em>, Mandalore supposedly <strong>never</strong> takes his full body armor off.

Although his outfit mostly looks comfortable, he is still wearing pieces of his Keyblade Armour, including one pauldron and both sabatons.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with and a slight variation in the GTA series. Despite the later games going to incredible lengths to include clothing changes (in V, your characters will change clothes between plays if you don't use them for a time) and lots of attempts at every day realism, when you go to save in a safehouse and sleep, you character always just lays on top of the sheets in whatever clothes you last had them in, no matter how uncomfortable an outfit you have on them (and if you have body armor equipped, that stays on too) or how close to their own closet (presumably full of their own night clothes) they are.

Justified since he has to be ready to defend her as her bodyguard at all times and because he wouldn't be able to survive in the poisonous environment of his and Astraea's new home without his armor's enchantments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> used to have "town clothes", a special kind of equipment that characters could switch into out of combat, automatically switching to armor in combat. The system saw little use even among roleplayers, as there were very few customization options for these, and those that existed were only available through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions">gem store</a>, so most roleplayers just used armor pieces for non-combat clothes instead. Eventually the town clothes system was removed, and the outfits themselves were converted into either skins for armor pieces or items that changed the appearance of the entire set of armor, both in and out of combat.

However, players respawn in so called "pajamas"; fatigues with a simple bullet proof vest and minimal weapon holster points, which would presumably be used outside of combat. Played straight in <em>Planetside 2</em>, as while it tones down the armor that players wear, all classes - bar the skintight Infiltrator armor - wears at minimum a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Cool Helmet</a>, a breastplate, and combat boots on top of fatigues or spandex.

No, not even the helmets. Or when they're crawling through damp caves. Or when racing on a track. Or <em>playing board games</em>. Said armor doesn't restrict their movements, seems to weigh nothing, and must be very thin indeed considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">some of the knights' outer extremities</a>.

To the point that one character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being a <em>robot</em></span> went completely unnoticed for months and best friends genuinely don't know what race each other are. Although in that case, Church didn't know Tucker's first name either, so you could just chalk that up to him being his usual unobservant self. Once CG began to be used, some of the Freelancers' faces have been shown, but like the Reds and Blues (and, really, Master Chief as mentioned in the Halo entry above), they seem to much prefer to just leave it on at all times. As the armor in question is supposed to be designed for comfort even when being worn for long periods, it's at least partially explainable.

He wears it while hanging out with his friends, eating dinner or even sleeping and it is implied he never took it off during the timeskip which lasted multiple months and involved him walking through half a continent.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/SteveAndCarlos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/SteveAndCarlos">Steve And Carlos</a></em>, this trope definitely seems in effect as the title characters are wearing their armor when they have absolutely no reason to while stranded alone together on an island without even any evidence of fauna to worry about.

In the episode "The Boiling Rock", two of the heroes infiltrate the eponymous prison, and, as they go in to the guard lounge to gather information, are told to take off the helmets and relax by the regular guards. The hero with the well known face in the Fire Nation is able to make up an excuse about always wanting to be prepared in case of a surprise attack and the veteran guards laugh it off as an overly by-the-book rookie and let him leave it on without further comment.

Being robots, the only time they don't wear these is when they're getting upgraded. Even so, the armor and helmets were all originally thought to be actual parts of their bodies, until in one episode, they took their helmets off and still functioned just fine.

Despite it normally being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor">Instant Armor</a>, it's an important plot point that he can't ever take it off, since the amulet he uses to summon it is out of reach.

<ul><li> According to the remaining sources, it was perfectly common for knights and mercenaries of the Middle Ages to wear some armor everywhere except at home and at formal occasions. Outside of impending battle, they would simply shed any uncomfortable outer layers and wear the lighter armor beneath. It still wasn't particularly comfortable, but it was important 'insurance' and more tolerable than full kit. Squires and knights-in-training were sometimes be tasked with wearing full plate armor for days, mostly to get them used to the weight, the heat, and the technique of moving gracefully in it.
<ul><li> One outstanding example of the above is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Le_Maingre">Jean Le Maingre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, better known as "Boucicaut", a 15th century French knight who earned a considerable reputation as both an military commander and a fitness fanatic. He wore a full suit of plate armour at all times during a workout regimen that featured jogging, splitting logs with an axe, <em>rock climbing</em> and a bit of gymnastics, as described in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-bnM5SuQkI">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> made by a Swiss medieval historian who set out to duplicate Boucicaut's training <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>... or rather for his doctoral thesis.
</li><li> One piece of gear that was relatively comfortable to wear at most times was the gambeson, which was a thick tunic of very densely layered linen that was durable enough to ward off blows from blunt weapons and even a glancing sword or axe strike. Because the gambeson was relatively light and comfortable, a knight or soldier could easily wear it around while doing daily tasks. The only real downside is that because of its thickness, a gambeson could get uncomfortable in hot weather.
</li></ul></li><li> After the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_reforms">Marian reforms<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of 107 BC, each soldier in the Roman legions would march while wearing his torso armor and carrying his shield and helmet on his back, as part of a roughly 50-60 pound (22.527 kg) load which also included his weapons, some tools, and 15 days' rations. This burden for each individual—which earned them the nickname "Marius's Mules"—ensured that the whole legion wasn't slowed down by having a large baggage train, and wearing their armor made them ready to defend themselves from unexpected attack. Once they reached their resting place for the night, the soldiers would have to do the sweaty work of constructing a fortified camp while still wearing their armor. It's been suggested that this is part of the reason that most Roman foot soldiers didn't wear as much armor as would have been technically possible: since they depended mostly on their large shields for defense, and since each soldier's armor had to be light enough for him to march and work in, they wore just enough to thoroughly protect the most vital parts of the body.
</li><li> Viriathus, Rome's main enemy during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LusitanianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LusitanianWars">Lusitanian Wars</a>, slept with his mail armor on in order to be ready to fight in case of emergency. The traitors whom Rome paid to murder him in his sleep had to stab him in the neck, the only vulnerable lethal point.
</li><li> The European brigandine was an armored jacket consisting of small overlapping steel plates riveted to the inside of a textile base. Besides the entry level ones being less expensive than a "white" cuirass of solid plates, it was probably also more practical for foot soldiers to wear: the front-closure type could be put on without assistance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note81ega');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note81ega" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note81ega');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">rich men-at-arms tended to wear rear-closure or side-closure cuirasses for better frontal protection, and had servants to help them put it on</span>, and the large number of small overlapping plates made it a bit more flexible and comfortable to wear all the time. They were laced across the chest so the weight was taken as tension rather than weight on the shoulders, and tapering at the waist allowed the hips to support part of the weight. While the military version was still intended as heavy protection, usually with a mail shirt underneath, more refined versions were made to be worn with civilian dress as concealed armor, eventually evolving into the "jack of plate" or "doublet of defense" with hundreds of tiny plates sewn into the fabric. Those who could afford it would use a very rich velvet or brocade as the outer covering of their brigandine, and decorative rivets were popular.
</li><li> During Cortez's conquest of the Aztec Empire, the natives attempted to launch a desperate night attack on the Conquistadors. It failed spectacularly, one of the reasons being that the Castilians had slept both armored and with weapons on hand.
</li><li> JLIST chemical protective gear is designed for continuous wear; there is a straw/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">emergency induction port</a> in the pro-mask so you can drink without taking it off.
</li><li> Many Live Action Roleplayers who have already got their uniform "settled" properly are loath to take it off again if they can avoid it. At some of the bigger, regular festival LARP events this can result in the surreal experience of seeing a gang of heavily armored men nipping into the local supermarket to stock up on beer and doughnuts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">while the locals don't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">so much as bat an eyelid</a>.
</li><li> Modern soldiers fighting in theaters where proper fortifications have not been set up yet often have to catch a nap whenever they can. It was not uncommon during the early months of the Iraq invasion for Coalition soldiers to sleep in a dug-out fox hole in the lulls between troop movements, and because they could be attacked at any moment they had to sleep in their body armor.
