He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent</a>.
</p><p>It's not exactly the hero any more, though. He's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">glowing eyes</a>, some new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings">Facial Markings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone">a different way</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes">of talking</a>, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch">new threads</a>, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">Enemy Within</a> when it's not the enemy, or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">Jekyll and super-Hyde</a>.
</p><p>Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil — he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as "evil" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id — this personality is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionIsEvil">physical manifestation of the character's basic drives</a> without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality — but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.

Thus, the hero faces the very real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTakeover">threat</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">not returning to normal</a>, each bout of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia">Alternate Identity Amnesia</a> causing him to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">more worried</a> about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood">Evil Feels Good</a>.
</p><p>The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question "why doesn't he just do that all the time?" with "because then the evil would take over." Additionally, if it leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, it can serve the same purpose as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a> in reverse — it justifies taking one member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a> or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil.

</p><p>One possible variation on this trope makes the Evil Side the <em>original</em> personality. This creates the odd situation of an "Evil" super-powerful monster whose "Good" not-as-powerful personality is dominant for whatever reason.

And also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>, as the manga shows that having one wouldn't just conveniently let you send it out on enemy too strong for you to take - taking Amon's powers changes Akira from meek and gentle boy into complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> and that even without letting Amon out. Amon however only breaks free in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> manga <em>AMON</em>, and an OVA of the same title.

Being under the influence of Baikinman or being near Anpanman triggers her evil heart, which powers her up even more, but she can break out of it when by her younger siblings, Melonpanna and Creampanda. Sometimes, Baikinman uses dirty tricks to completely remove her good side, turning her into Black Rollpanna, a ruthless fighter that is even more powerful than when she has both hearts, and nothing stops her, not even her siblings, until both hearts are together. For these reasons, she prefers to wander the earth alone, in fear of her evil heart being triggered.

Surprisingly enough, Shoutmon averted this by having no "evil" powered side.
</li></ul></li><li> Son Goku of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> faced this early on with his Oozaru transformations. In this form he loses all sense of self while gaining immense strength and size; the best solutions found were to either cut off his tail or <em>blow up the moon</em>. The transformation into the Oozaru, while generally a bad thing, did have two positive outcomes. One was the escape of Goku and friends from Emperor Pilaf; the second was Gohan defeating Vegeta... by landing on him.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> takes Oozarus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when Goku transforms into one as a Super Saiyan. Think a giant raging ape is bad? Try a giant raging Super Saiyan ape. Though Goku's able to come to his senses, which sparks his transformation into a Super Saiyan 4.
</li><li> The Super Saiyan state acts like this without proper training. The transformation occurs in a moment of pure rage, and the resulting personality shift leaves the Saiyan struggling with an overwhelming anger. In the Cell Saga, Goku and Gohan train in order to resolve this issue, making Super Saiyan as natural and comfortable as possible so they can maintain it without extra effort as well as retaining their own personalities.
</li><li> Frieza even comments on this when Goku beats him around as a Super Saiyan. He asks if Goku isn't being as cold blooded as he is, and concludes that Goku is still struggling to control the rage in him and that it's uncertain if he will win.
</li><li> Son Gohan's Super Saiyan 2 form is a truly chilling example. It is more than a little disquieting to watch the kindhearted and sensitive little boy we have come to care about over three sagas turn into a gleefully cold-blooded sadist when he achieves the Messianic power of Super Saiyan 2.
</li><li> In the Buu Saga, Vegeta falls under Babidi's mind control, becoming Majin Vegeta. However, it turns out that Vegeta is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBrainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBrainwashed">Not Brainwashed</a>: he <em>let</em> Babidi put him under the wizard's "control" for the power boost that comes with it, and is perfectly capable of ignoring Babidi's commands (because they distract Vegeta from the reason he did it in the first place: fighting Goku).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, we have Kale, a Saiyan from Universe 6. Her "Super Saiyan Beserk" form is just as violent as Broly's Legendary Super Saiyan form. Cabba could barely survive and Caulifla had to bail him out.
</li><li> Surprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Broly</a></em> is a downplayed version of this, as when he turns Super Saiyan and loses all his sanity, he is more like a feral beast than a raging psychopath, even fighting with himself to avoid killing somebody.

It also can control Allen when he's unconscious, and it tends to be very vicious. Then again, it's only dangerous to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Akuma</a>.
<ul><li> Also Arystar Krory, although he has less of a Super-Powered Evil Side than a Super-Powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> badass Side.
</li><li> There's also the Noah, although they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">(affably) evil</a> to begin with.

<ul><li> In the most recent chapters, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Kanda stabs Allen and awakens his Noah side,</span> there are clear hints that the Fourteenth is <em>terrifyingly</em> powerful, even by Noah standards.

Considering a single Nodos can sometimes destroy a whole planet on its own at its normal levels of power, a Nodos in Mental Chaos is a frightening thing indeed. In Bellcross, the Nodos that serves the human Age, Mental Chaos is shown by his skin and "armor" turning dark gray, almost black, and a set of blue spheres implanted in his body begins to glow bright red. And he roars a lot. Then he begins <em>leveling whatever galaxy he's in at that moment, before moving on to another area</em>.

She states quite clearly that he used to be so overwhelming that it seemed to be stupid to be afraid of him. Because she was afraid, it was proof that he was weaker than before. In any case, he's still very kick ass. She's right. When he's in this state he's basically letting his anger and pride control him (something he had often warned others against), lacking the ability and focus that he'd shown in the rest of the series. This fight is also the first time that she gets the best of him, first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling him out for his behavior</a>, then landing a solid hit that knocks him off his feet.</span>

Another time he mistook an assassination attempt for an earthquake and saved everybody, even the enemy soldiers who'd been trying to kill him. Also, he has been known to say nonsensical things about fire brigades etc., just like Yuuri always does, just in a serious, booming way.
</li><li> In the manga he gets a lot closer to the 'evil' line, but is a lot less divorced, in terms of identity, from normal Yuuri, whose lifelong tendency to a really violent temper is underlined. But the manga is darker than the anime. And Yuuri accidentally stabbed Wolfram half to death a while back in the novels. Genre Woobiefication?

In a series where everyone has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic powers</a>, it's hard to stand out when you have boring ol' telekinesis... unless you have a Super-Powered Evil Side that can <em>uproot trees and use them as weapons</em>.

But if things seem to be getting out of hand even for him to handle (usually when his friends are in danger), his fighting style and mindset slowly begin changing into the highly pragmatic and ruthless Battousai, the assassin he was ten years ago. He switches the extremely humble <em>sessha</em> for the brash <em>ore</em>, loses the <em>de gozaru</em> from his speech, his eyes turn gold and more slanted and he moves for the kill. In the anime, Battousai seems to be considered an actual personality Kenshin has learned to seal off by creating his rurouni persona - he has to punch himself in the face to push it back and revert back. In the manga, this gets lampshaded a bit when Kenshin remarks that his face muscles have cramped and he isn't able to end his permanent death glare.
<ul><li> It's an unusual case, as in his current state Kenshin is actually much <em>stronger</em> than when he was the Battousai, having fully mastered Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, including learning its ultimate technique, in the intervening years. But as the Battousai, he never held anything back, always going for the immediate kill. If he didn't stop himself every time the Battousai persona tried to emerge, though, he'd combine his increased strength with his former ruthlessness to become a near-unstoppable killing machine.

However, Etrigan is only as restrained as he is because of Bruce's virtue, and in reality, Bruce has been trapped with Etrigan for over a thousand years, pretending to be his own descendant unknown to himself because his servant Alfred (in reality Merlin the wizard), has kept watch over him and constantly changed his identity for all this time out of guilt of dooming him to an eternity as a prison for Etrigan. Bruce attempts to exorcise Etrigan, but the results are disastrous, resulting in the deaths of Catwoman, Killer Croc, Commissioner Gordon and several police officers, as well as Bruce's fiancee Glenda.

Even before he had his Archs, Jago was a competent fighter but when things got rough, he could us his dark power side, known as "Papa Jupiter". At his most basic level, Jupiter can boost Jago's fighting power to the point where he can plaster ten grown men. At the full extent of his powers, he is AT LEAST as powerful as either the Almighty One or Lady Hild (possibly more so). Unfortunately at this level of power, he has no problem with killing people, even those he cares about (though he prefers enemies as they tend to fight back). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As the story progresses, its revealed that Jupiter taking over is the only thing that Jago is REALLY afraid of. This is brought to a head during the Deity Games when he faces a mirror that reflects a person's worst fears as sees the result of what a fully unleashed Jupiter can do; he devastates the world, crucifies Lamb and Damascus, beats Lind to death with a rock and uses his knife to murder their infant son. The physic torment this causes is so great that it actually makes the mirror shatter.</span>

While not strictly another personality, it's certainly another side of him. According to Carol (who's had a look inside his mind), like all the experiences that should have screwed him up have been locked away in a box in his mind, constituting his dark side. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">frighteningly cold</a>, ruthlessly calculating, and while not explicitly more powerful, Carol describes it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>, while others describe it as being frighteningly reminiscent of a young Magneto.

<ul><li> Towards the end of the first book, Harry's protection is revealed as a fragment of the Phoenix Force, and the start of <em>Ghosts of the Past</em> shows that he can tap into it. Considering the already mentioned dark side and that the Phoenix has taken him over to protect him, appearing in the gear of the Dark Phoenix and destroying everything in its way, this is rather worrying - while the Phoenix is broadly benevolent or at least, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lily, the White Phoenix of the Crown,</span> is, the power itself is a) morally neutral, b) incredibly volatile. As a result, Loki's fear is that that the two will combine and turn him into the Dark Phoenix. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This fear turns out to be entirely justified.</span>

Instead, it leads to valuable communication that helps the heroes learn the true cause of the conflict.

Yet Dean was able to beat the same angel into a bloody mess and leave him laying on the floor with probably a broken nose.

However, if they give in to their Rage <em>too</em> fully, they can enter a state called "Thrall of the Wyrm," just like a normal frenzy, except that it's inescapable, and tends to provoke rather horrific behavior (typically either cannibalism, rabid dismemberment, or... erm... defilement).

Depending on the Shadow, this might take many forms, some direct and some seemingly helping the wraith. The latter type often has ways to enhance the wraith's body when temporarily in control - better attributes, more magic powers or even items appearing only during the Shadow's catharsis. Such wraiths then always have the ability to let their Shadows handle combats too tough for them, but are generally loathe to do so because there's no telling what else the Shadow might do while in control.

After this, Django eventually gains the ability to transform between human "Red Django" and vampire "Black Django." Though it might be argued that Black Django isn't that much more powerful as, despite his dark-based powers, he loses the ability to use all of Django's magic (gaining new spells only he can use) and is harmed by both rain and sunshine. In the third game, the transformation is changed to a "Trance" attack, where he becomes much more powerful, however the transformation only lasts a limited time, or until you leave the room.

</li><li> Dizzy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> has a similar problem with one of her sentient wings. She's VERY powerful and unleashing her true powers causes her to lose control to her evil wing, Necro, whose motto is "Destroy everything!". With Dizzy being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a> this really troubles her. Not that the other wing, Undine, is much better. Unlike Necro, she won't attack anyone who comes within reach randomly, but she <em>will</em> annihilate anyone she perceives as even the slightest threat to Dizzy without even a second thought... and her definition of "threat" is just a little bit too broad for Dizzy's tastes. Undine is the wing that unleashes Dizzy's version of Gamma Ray... that says it all. Oh, and her tail has a will of its own too and often eats anything within biting reach.
</li><li> Dark Jak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em>, after being exposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Dark Eco</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Anti-Form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Drive Form</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> subverts this trope as it's actually a penalty form (at best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>) to discourage overuse of the Drive Forms; it can only be triggered randomly (chance determined by a hidden "Anti-Point" mechanic) or by activating any form but Final in battle with the ability Light &amp; Darkness active. While Anti-Sora looks <em>damn cool</em>, he's not actually much more powerful than Sora in terms of offense, and can do nothing other than attack solo in a blitzing frenzy of clawing, kicking, and firing dark energy blasts. The inability to heal, gain experience, or really do <em>anything</em> else makes this form a liability. Also, Sora takes 50% more damage while in this form and can't revert until the drive gauge expires or he leaves the level.
</li><li> Riku, on the other hand, plays this trope straight in four of the games<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fqry');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fqry" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fqry');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(in chronological order: KH1, Chain of Memories, 358/2 Days, and KH2)</span>, but primarily in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></em> when you can play as him and "Dark Mode" is one of his key abilities. Interestingly, he no longer has one as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Dream Drop Distance</a></em>, but only because his control over his dark powers has improved to the point where he can use them freely without transforming.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> plays it straight for Sora by allowing him to willingly transform into Rage Form as a situation command when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff">his health is below 25%</a>. It locks out his ability to use magic, items and summons as before, but gives him overwhelming power and speed to compensate. Additionally, Rage!Sora is capable of wielding a Keyblade, and has access to its own unique finishers, Limits and Shotlock. It will also mitigate any previous damage dealt to Sora by restoring him to full health upon transformation. Best of all, you can keep your party members who can also still heal you with their own abilities and items. This form is so powerful that Sora was able to critically injure Xehanort, who forcibly transformed him into this state by extracting his Light side, despite the latter having the χ-Blade and the full power of Kingdom Hearts at his disposal. According to Word of God, the difference between Rage and Anti is that Anti is a form Sora takes on when his heart is completely stained by darkness. Rage, on the other hand, doesn't go that far and is triggered by Sora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">raw fury and anger</a>.

Riot of the Blood Iori, however, has absolutely no sense of self-restraint and will attack anything on sight.
<ul><li> Leona also fits this trope, sometimes even more perfectly than Iori, because she is in the "good side" while Iori can't decide himself; with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a> spices added, though that said, she has smiled <a class="urllink" href="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/7456/kof96ika35.gif">once<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

The adults tell him to go master it already so that he can control it and use it for his own, which he manages to do in <em>Cold Steel II</em>. By <em>Cold Steel III</em> however, he's losing control over it because it's growing too powerful and Rean becoming even more stressed out that the one time he doesn't want to lose control over it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he ends up giving in to it and ends up slaying the beast that was holding back the curse of Erebonia.</span>

</li><li> So, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarySkelterNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarySkelterNightmares">Mary Skelter: Nightmares</a></em>, the Blood Maidens have the ability to go into a so called "Massacre Mode" ("Genocide" in the original Japanese version), which is <em>kinda</em> like one of these, making them far more powerful and aggressive when coming into contact with large amounts of Marchen blood. However, said monster blood, along with mental stress, builds up a form of corruption, and if it becomes too great, they will enter their <em>real</em> Superpowered Evil Side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Blood Skelter</a>, which makes them go <em>completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a></em>, communicating solely in pained screams and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">some of the most insane laughter you've ever heard</a>. Good thing Jack's around to keep them out of it.
<ul><li> Speaking of Jack, his Nightmare self in Mary Skelter 2 gains a so-called "Ripper Mode", attained when his heart rate gauge fills up too much.

Either way, this is especially bad, because 1) Nightmares are freaking strong already, and 2) the only thing keeping him from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> is a psychic link with Otsuu, but if he goes all Jack the Ripper, she very much risks going into Blood Skelter herself. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Well that's fun.</a></em>

</li><li> The fight against Dark Rock in <em>Battle Network 4</em> does the same, using every chip the player had ever used, including Navi summon chips and Giga Chips, and also can use all the Program Advances you've performed up to the point you fight it. Unlike the player version, there's no warning when it uses them.
</li><li> Chaos Shadow Soul in <em>Battle Network 5</em> makes MegaMan completely invincible and uncontrollable as the AI attempts to duplicate the player's fighting style.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some of the HDD forms have this going on, as it not only boosts the CPUs' power but also noticeably changes their personalities (even if they're admittedly not <em>evil</em> per se). Noire for instance becomes more brash and cocky upon transformation, Blanc meanwhile becomes more rage-prone and aggressive and Vert herself gets more aloof and haughty. Plutia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory">Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory</a></em> plays this more straight, becoming a full-blown sadist as Iris Heart who has no issues harming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe">anybody</a></em> physically, emotionally or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">sexually</a></em>.
</li><li> The Chaos forms from <em>Chaos Chanpuru</em> play this trope more straight than the above examples.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's the Slayer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>, the Ravenous Incarnation from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a>: Mask of the Betrayer</em>. The Spirit-Eater curse can grant some pretty incredible powers if you feed enough...problem being that the curse is, you know, a <em>curse</em> - an utterly empty blight upon the spirit backed by divine malice - and will overcome you, drive you insane, push you to devour the spirits of all you see in an animal frenzy, and finally obliterate you so entirely that even your soul is destroyed forever. Giving in to your hunger for spirits to get more power speeds up that process a <em>lot</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em>, when you collect 66 souls of enemies you killed, you transform into an unstoppable demonic killing machine. It only lasts for about 30 seconds but that's all the time you'll need to obliterate an area full of monsters just by <em>looking</em> at them.
</li><li> Every single main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> must be recruited by defeating their Super-Powered Evil Side, or more accurately, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Shadow Archetype</a>: the embodiment of all the things about themselves they can't stand to admit. The shadows have grown immensely powerful out of all proportion simply because being denied makes them stronger; once accepted, they become much weaker and "tame."
<ul><li> The series also gives us Black Frost—the horrific result of adorable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Mascot Mook</a> Jack Frost remembering he's supposed to be a demon after all and invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">The Power of Hate</a>. The process apparently renders him awesomely more powerful... and much more evil. Unless you're playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>, in which case it turns him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Pun-spewing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl-esque</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice">warrior of love and justice</a>. ...And just as awesomely powerful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has the traitor. Every Persona-using character has a costume which appears on their body when they enter the Metaverse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The traitor has <em>two</em>. One is a campy outfit styled after a "hero of justice", which he wears when summoning Robin Hood. This form has all the normal powers of a Persona-user. Should he switch to his other Persona, Loki, he'll change into a black, armoured outfit which adds a neck brace and helmet to the magical masks. This form has some abilities which most Persona-users definitely do not have, like inducing psychosis in a target and amplifying attack power massively in exchange for a defence drop. He's also a lot more open about how sadistic and angry he is when in this form, culminating in him using his powers on <em>himself</em> so that he can tear the protagonist apart with no remorse.</span>

The Pokémon in question will be surrounded by a black aura, and will do more damage - BUT. It won't be able to use any moves you've unlocked, it can't be healed, and it will also take recoil damage when it attacks. Thankfully, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">call out to it</a>, which brings it back to its senses.
<ul><li> A truer example would be Hoopa from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Gen VI games</a>, who has a compact "Confined" form and a monstrous "Unbound" form where its Psychic/Ghost typing changes to Psychic/Dark. The "Evil" part is more prevalent in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHoopaAndTheClashOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHoopaAndTheClashOfAges">Pokémon: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages</a></em>, where the Unbound side becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> As said in comics, any game that has the option of the black suit has it as this. In games such as <em>Spider-Man 3</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></em>, his attacks become more violent and aggressive, usually with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> and spike tendrils.

His comments are actually the opposite, however, and he'll say things like "Yeah, let's have some good old fashioned RAGE!" and "Raaage! I'm not actually angry, I just like saying it." But it's justified, since Madame Web is using her powers to keep the suit from taking over.
</li></ul></li><li> The Terror Mask in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse">Splatterhouse</a></em> series embodies this trope, especially in <em>Splatterhouse 3</em> where its own personality, and its effect on Rick, become more apparent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a>: Ultimate Sith Edition</em>, you go into the ruins of the Jedi temple and eventually fight your Super-Powered Evil Side.
</li><li> Ryu, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> series, has a power inside of him known as the Satsui no Hadou, or Surge of Murderous Intention, which he works to suppress and was retconned as the reason that Sagat received the scar he bears on his chest. Akuma (Gouki in the Japanese version) represents someone who has fully given in to the Satsui no Hadou, and when he's not holding back, he is truly fearsome. In <em>Street Fighter Alpha 2</em> and <em>3</em>, Evil Ryu is actually a secret, playable character (a dark-skinned, red-eyed version of Ryu with some additional attacks that were borrowed from Akuma).
<ul><li> Ryu's Super-Powered Evil Side is a result of his being unable to control the power. However, since the power still involves a willingness to kill and a more brutal mindset even when in control, he makes no effort to even try to learn how.
</li><li> Evil Ryu returns to the <em>SF</em> storyline through <em>Super Street Fighter IV</em>, where he's a playable character. This time he has gone from merely a dark-skinned, red-eyed Ryu to a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> with a kanji carved on his flesh and a glowing orb where his heart should be. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Making Evil Ryu return to the surface was a plot point in the <em>Ties that Bind</em> tie-in anime. It almost works.</span>
</li><li> Oni represents this to Akuma. Whereas Akuma does have some degree of control over the Satsui no Hado, Oni is Akuma when the Killing Intent finally consumes him. Oni drops the moral code of only fighting worthy opponents that Akuma held to, and will fight, and even kill, anybody and everybody he comes across. Oni is the one thing Akuma <em>doesn't</em> want to become. And the most terrifying thing is that Oni is miles above most other fighters, with only a handful including <em>Cody and Gouken</em> able to challenge him.

Then, the final boss proposes to "cure you"—and it sort of works. In the sequel, you can transform without harm, even if you're playing as a good guy.

After Tekken 2, though, Kazuya's good side is suppressed by the Devil's blood and Kazuya made an agreement with it and he's able to control the form as he pleases. A shred of his humanity can be seen in his T5 ending where he defeats his grandfather and holds him in his arms, smiling at him and remembering his few happy childhood moments, before the Devil's blood takes control and kills him.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Tower Of Fortune</em>, The protagonist automatically transforms into a hulking, angry giant at 100% rage, with an 80% chance to hit (as opposed to the usual 45-65% range) and vicious, bloodthristy attacks from punching to sonic-screaming to pouncing on them and ripping their throats out with each subsequent hit.

As a result, Batman has no fear. NONE. Bruce Wayne (in disguise) infiltrates some facility and is caught by the Scarecrow. Bruce awakens in a zoo, where the only exit is next to the crocodiles' cage. From a high hill, the Scarecrow confronts him. Bruce plays dumb, pretending to be a petty thief who was simply snooping around for loose cash. Scarecrow shoots him with a gas gun and then dares him to approach the crocodile cage. Bruce crosses over the cage without fear, and is tackled by the beasts. As he goes under, a red stain dots the water, and the Scarecrow leaves, satisfied. Suddenly, Bruce reemerges from the water, and as one crocodile's body floats up, he walks away looking unharmed.

Later it's explained that, instead of turning Beast Boy into an actual lycanthrope, the chemicals only unleashed what was already there (which makes no sense considering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they also changed Adonis</span>), and he's given an antidote so that he won't transform against his will. He once again manifests this hidden wild side in a battle against Slade, slicing through a number of his goons before Slade puts a stop to it with his own supercharged powers. Possible subversion: It's made quite clear that "Man-Beast" isn't evil, just a really powerful, rather intelligent animal. Like any animal, it becomes hostile when scared, but generally it keeps to its human form's wishes. Beast Boy still expresses concern that it's still inside him at the end of the episode. He does seem to have acquired a degree of control over it later on, though he rarely uses it.
