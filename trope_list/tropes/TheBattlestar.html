</p><p>Let's backtrack a bit.
</p><p>During World War II, the honored tradition of building more and more powerful gun-toting battleships came to an abrupt halt when naval artillery became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfNavalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfNavalWarfare">largely supplanted by the aircraft carrier</a>. It had none of the battleship's armament and durability, but it could project force hundreds of kilometers away, without ever endangering the ship itself — which made most WWII aerial/naval battles decidedly one-sided.
</p><p>Modern warfare may eventually subvert this trend. Currently, major warships that aren't carriers or amphibious assault ships are missile ships, each capable of launching a relative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>, so the other side better hope it isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">Point Defenseless</a>. As missile technology and remote piloting advance, the aircraft launched by the carrier may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">unmanned smart munitions</a>, blurring the line between missiles and attack craft.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>However, warfare largely dominated by purely automated systems can take away from importance of human characters in a war story. Thus, authors are likely to explain that missile combat didn't take for various reasons, such as abundance of electronic countermeasures to disrupt missile guidance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">accurate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">point defenses</a>, or electronic warfare potentially compromising the effectiveness of remotely piloted (or automated) craft.
</p><p>This progression takes us back to the battlestar: It has the heavy armor and big guns of a battleship, along with the fighters and point defense weapons of a carrier. This makes perfect sense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAir">assuming carrying fighters in space makes sense</a>, because:
</p><p></p><ul><li> A) Lack of gravity means you don't have to waste the entire top on runways and the entire bottom on being underwater.
</li><li> B) The extremely thin atmosphere and the huge amount of free space means that the range of weapons is enormous (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange">or it should, anyway</a>).

</p><p>As a general rule, the Battlestar is portrayed in one of three ways:
</p><ul><li> Battleship carrying fighters. This is essentially a capital ship with the primary offensive options being its own big guns, with the fighters to serve as interceptors against incoming enemy strikes or to provide utility and ability for surgical strikes when main cannons are too blunt of an instrument. The Battlestar <em>Galactica</em> is the epitome of this, along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Imperial Star Destroyers</a>.
</li><li> Carrier with extra guns and armor. This ship essentially behaves like a real life aircraft carrier, in that the primary offensive option is its embarked fighter wing, and the guns and armor lean more towards self defense options. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">TCS</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Tiger Claw</a></em> are excellent examples of this
</li><li> The ship is not a war vessel <em>per se</em>; rather, it is an exploration or colony craft, armed out of necessity to have the widest array of available options. Its guns and air wing may very well have applications outside of combat, such as exploration, landing and dealing with the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia">The Sidonia</a> matches this type, as does the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Enterprise</a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">-D</a>.
</li></ul><p>The largest ones may be examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">Mile-Long Ship</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship">Planet Spaceship</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with the 1981 game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlestars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battlestars">Battlestars</a></em>, the elite Autobot fighters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TransformersZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TransformersZone">Transformers: Return of Convoy</a></em>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/CaptainAmericaAllies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/CaptainAmericaAllies">John Walker's former sidekick</a>.
</p><p>Compare/Contrast with its primary competing/companion trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">The Dreaded Dreadnought</a>. Both fixtures of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSciFiFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSciFiFleet">Standard Sci-Fi Fleet</a>, but both can and do appear in other settings. Both usually occupying the slot of "scariest thing around," but while the Battlestar is about the vessel's combined aircraft carrier/battleship nature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">The Dreaded Dreadnought</a> is about the tendency to call the scariest vehicle in a setting a "Dreadnought."

<ul><li> From 1974, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> is probably the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>. In 1979 the series was dubbed and broadcast in English as <em>Star Blazers</em>, with the ship renamed the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousAndMythologicalThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousAndMythologicalThemeNaming">Argo</a></em> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to a similar story from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>.
<ul><li> Also more obviously the <em>Lexington</em>-class battleship carriers in the Comet empire series, which had two battleship turrets in front, and a carrier deck in the back.
<ul><li> The <em>Lexington</em>-class ships are based on the IJS <em>Ise</em> and <em>Hyuga</em>; see the Real Life section in the description.
</li><li> Even further borne out by the fact that the American <em>Lexington</em>-class of carriers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> were originally built to be battlecruisers.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Rainbow Galaxy battle, the Gamilons had a battleship/carrier that had a runway deck that flipped over to reveal laser cannon turrets.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>. While carrier-type ships do have cannons for ship-to-ship combat, they are not primary fighting units and use cannons mostly in self-defense and to protect fighters docking for resupplying. Ship-to-ship combat is mostly handled by dedicated battleships, of which the command ships are the most powerful (including Yang Wen-li's <em>Hyperion</em> and Reinhard von Lohengramm's <em>Brunhild</em>).
</li><li> There are, many, many examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>, starting with the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> and its <em>White Base</em>. Basically, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> in the saga <em>has</em> to be a carrier to launch titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> (and normal fighters) but, depending on the series, can have more or less firepower to make it a battleship. Most recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> is clearly more of a carrier since it can barely defend itself without Gundams. However, both <em>Archangel</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Gundam SEED</a></em> and <em>Minerva</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> pack a serious punch, complete with integrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a>.
<ul><li> It should be noted, however that in most <em>Gundam</em> series, these types of ship are usually limited to very short production runs. The original series's Pegasus class had less than ten ships of the line. In later series, we see the carrier elements becoming more prominent in ship design. Only two ships were built of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Gundam SEED</a></em>'s Archangel class.
</li><li> Also notable is the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> from the original series followed the traditional "you can only have one or the other" mentality, with older ships even being forced to carry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> <em>strapped to their hulls</em> when the latter were introduced. This was the primary reason they came so close to being trounced by Zeon early in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dai-Gurren of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> had twelve-inch guns as well as a hangar for Team Gurren's Gunmen.
<ul><li> The Chouginga Dai-Gurren used to be the <em>fucking Moon</em>, and did its job for a while before <em>towing the original Moon back into orbit</em>. It could also become an humanoid mecha that could shoot at all points of space and time. Simultaneously.
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous-class ships of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>. Especially later versions like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Battle Frontier</a></em>, which had all sorts of cannons and CIWS mounts as well as its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>.
<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">SDF-1</a> even had a entire city in it, in addition to MORE guns on it than some of the later <em>New Macross</em>-class ships such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Battle 7</a></em>. That said, the animation budget wasn't up to showing them traverse and fire like they do in the newer shows so they end up being largely static decorations. Those four massive railguns on the docking assembly (the 'shoulder' in battle mode) are never once shown firing, for instance.
<ul><li> While the SDF-1 itself was did carry a substantial air wing of its own, half of its actual effective air wing (and more than two thirds of it in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Do You Remember Love?</a></em>/Post-Refit incarnation) comes from the two ships permanently docked as its "arms" — specifically the <em>Prometheus</em> aircraft carrier in the TV series and manga, and the two <em>ARMD</em>-class space carriers in the <em>DYRL?</em>/Refit version.

<ul><li> <em>Northampton</em>-class stealth <em>frigates</em>, small picket and escort ships with a heavy punch for their size and a small air wing of 24 Valkyries (up to 37 in special missions) for defense.
</li><li> The stealth cruiser debuting in <em>Frontier</em>, slightly upscaled <em>Northamptons</em> with the same air wing and a much stronger punch.
</li><li> <em>Guantanamo-</em>class stealth carriers, which are not that much different from WW2 escort carriers, being smallish ships built around a modest air wing with little else.
</li><li> <em>Uraga</em> and <em>Saratoga</em>-class fleet carriers, which have a modest antiship weapons fit, and are built around their air wings as the primary striking option.
</li><li> <em>New Macross</em>-class warships: they're primarily operated like fleet carriers, but carry a robust antiship weapons loadout, and have the Macross cannon, which is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> built into a frigate-sized ship, docked with them. <em>Macross Quarter</em> and its sister ships operate on essentially the same principle, but scaled down to escort carrier size.

<ul><li> The Prequels bring us the <em>Acclamator</em>-class and <em>Venator</em>-class vessels, which serve as army transports and spacecraft carriers respectively. <em>Acclamators</em> also end up as being used as <em>floating</em> carriers as well. Venators actually have a lot more fighter capacity than the bigger Imperial Star Destroyers and even the Super Star Destroyers (though that was later retconned to state that Super Star Destroyers <em>can</em> carry a lot more fighters, but it would be easier to load those fighters in the escort fleet that always accompanies it, and if necessary, be a mothership for <em>those</em>.

(See <em>Babylon 5</em> below.)

Some fighters have bombing capabilities, as well.
</li><li> The Death Star also qualifies: it has FTL propulsion, carries countless smaller fighter craft, has surface-mounted turbolasers for enemy fighters that get too close (although the first DS's turbolasers are ineffective at this), and the superlaser itself can take out large craft, as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. And, you know, planets.

Although not intended to get directly involved in combat, the CLACs do carry some of the more traditional naval weapons in an acknowledgment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">Finagle's Law</a>.
<ul><li> The Grayson Space Navy's version of the <em>Minotaur</em>, the <em>Covington</em> class, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a>, however. The GSN felt that a CLAC's odds of survival standing directly in the wall of battle were low enough that they chose to arm the <em>Covington</em>s only with countermeasures and point-defence clusters, making them entirely dependent on their embarked LAC complement for offensive striking power, much like most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> aircraft carriers.
</li><li> Prior to the creation of the CLACs, there are the Q-ships sent to the Silesian Confederacy under Honor's command. In fact, these new Q-ships not only carry dreadnought-level weapons but can also launch up to 12 LACs. For bonus points, the Q-ships can also launch missile pods (previously, they were always dragged into battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam">Tractor Beams</a>). So not only can the Q-ships be considered prototype CLACs but also prototype podnaughts.
</li></ul></li><li> In Andrey Livadny's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy">The History of the Galaxy</a></em> series, most large human ships are Battlestars, able to launch at least some number of fighters. Smaller ships, including dedicated missile frigates are unable to do that, fulfilling more specialized roles. While there are no dedicated carrier ships (probably because the writer is Russian and is, therefore, influenced by Russian naval mentality). The largest (and most powerful) human ships are the flagship cruisers, able to launch dozens of fighters, as well as being armed to the teeth (missiles, plasma throwers, lasers, mass drivers). The defenses include point-defense systems, EM shielding against energy weapons, thick armor, and anti-boarding shield generators.
<ul><li> And yes, the author is a bit off on the issues of size, crew, and the number of fighters. The ships are often ridiculously large (topping off at around 7 <em>kilometers</em> in length for flagship cruisers), with ridiculously small crews (justified with the ubiquitous use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">Instant A.I.: Just Add Water!</a>; in fact, ships <em>can</em> be fully automated) and much smaller number of fighters than you would expect for a ship this size. Slightly justified with flagship cruisers, which feature an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">anti-matter emitter</a> which takes up a <em>fifth</em> of the ship. This is particularly egregious on the author's website, where he lists ship stats. The standard crew size for a cruiser is around 100, although one novel mentions a heavy cruiser with 2000 people on board (still low, but better).
</li><li> Later novels mention a change in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Confederacy of Suns</a> military docrine with the introduction of a new class of FTL-capable modular fighters for defending Periphery systems. A new class of carrying cruisers (Russian writers, as a rule, hate the word "carrier"), which will act as mobile bases for rapid reaction squadrons without the cruisers themselves engaging in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> Although it doesn't start out with them, the <em>Beijing</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lacuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lacuna">Lacuna</a></em> receives a small fighter wing by the middle of the book.

With the exception of some heavy cruisers and very fast scouts, virtually everything is a capital ship. There are no 'fighters' or light bombing craft at all. Probably because the series started in the 1930s, when few people realized the potential of carriers.

</li><li> Late in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten">Sten</a></em> series, there's a newly built "battle cruiser" named <em>Victory</em> — which also carries a flotilla of twelve tacships (roughly equivalent to PT boats). Sten is dubious about this: he likes tacships, but <em>carrying</em> them makes the <em>Victory</em> vulnerable — lots of stuff that'll blow up; not enough space dedicated to armor to keep that stuff from blowing up; and having hangars at the rear of the ship interferes with placing sensors and weapons back there.
<div class="indent">Sten had experience with tools, vehicles, and ships that were ostensibly dual- or multiple-purpose. Almost without exception that meant that the tool did quite a number of things badly, and nothing well.
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune">Legends of Dune</a></em> prequel trilogy, the <em>Ballista</em>-class battleships are the main warships used by the League Armada. Besides formidable weaponry, they carry 20 troop transports, 15 shuttles, 50 patrol craft, and 200 <em>Kindjal</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighters</a>. Each one also has a crew of 1500. They are later equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> and Holtzmann drives in addition to their pre-fold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL drives</a>. Even then, many are still destroyed during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a>. After the defeat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Omnius</a>, it can be assumed the <em>Ballista</em>e were retired.
<ul><li> About 80 years after the end of the Butlerian Jihad, 200 of these are given by a weak-willed Emperor to appease Manford Torondo, the leader of the anti-technological Butlerians. About half of these are destroyed during a space battle with Venport Holdings forces, not that Torondo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">cares about casualties</a>. It's noted that, being 80-year-old mothballed relics, they are inferior to latest warships used by Venhold (just 20 Venhold ships are able to inflict massive damage to the Butlerian fleet) and, likely, the Emperor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> had the Blade Ship of Visser Three, which carried a flotilla of Bug Fighters, and probably plenty of Dracon cannons, and the Andalite dome ships, which possibly doubled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMotherShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMotherShip">The Mother Ship</a>. They could split in two so that the front half could become the fighter ship, while the back contained crew living quarters in a dome.
<ul><li> The pool ship is a barracks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Airborne Aircraft Carrier</a> with <em>big fucking guns</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreadEmpiresFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreadEmpiresFall">Dread Empire's Fall</a></em>, there's essentially one kind of ship, and the only differences are the crew (max G's they can pull) and the number of missiles they have and the number of launchers they have for them. Apparently even the largest ships only need a single missile to gut them. That said, missiles are used to counter missiles in this setting, so more launchers can be more safety. All of these ships carry a crapton of missiles (but there are notable levels of "crapton"), defense lasers of various kinds, and small crafts called "pinnaces". A pinnace is meant to travel a safe distance behind the missiles and update their trajectories — the mothership cannot make tactical decisions from a light-minute away, after all! Those pinnace pilots have a notably low survival rate in combat, though a few have absurdly high kill-counts, mostly from single engagements. There is no dogfighting of any sort, because inertia in space. In a given battle, by the time the two sides have closed with each other, usually one or both sides are left with only destroyed, irradiated husks. In one battle in a gravity well, where the two factions made very close passes at each other, it was horribly messy and casualties were staggering.
</li><li> CSS <em>Invincible</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFlightEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFlightEngineer">Flight Engineer</a></em> trilogy is a prototype pocket carrier intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> in comparison to the larger fleet carriers. Her primary armament is her fighter complement, but she's hardly lacking in other weapons and is very fast.
</li><li> The TC/USNA <em>America</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em> series is primarily used as a carrier with several ways of launching her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionlessDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionlessDrive">grav</a>-fighters (a single fighter is potentially capable of taking down several capital ships). When not launching fighters out of her spinal magnetic accelerators, those can be used to launch kinetic kill slugs instead. While they don't pack as much a punch as dedicated railgun battleships, the <em>America</em> can still pack quite a punch. Given the distances involved in space combat and the lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">FTL communication</a> or sensors means that firing unguided munitions at a ship several light minutes away is useless, as your sensor data is that many minutes old. Standard tactics involve for the carrier dropping out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">meta-space</a> to launch fighters immediately for a near-c strike prior to the arrival of the (much slower) main fleet to the enemy. With any luck, the enemy will detect the arrival of the fleet only seconds before the near-c strike.
<ul><li> The nature of the grav-fighter propulsion (singularity projection) means that, for the most part, they really can maneuver like a jet fighter in air. Even better, in fact, as gravity forces acting on the fighter and the pilot are largely uniform, meaning a fighter can perform a tight turn at several hundred G-forces and not even feel it (beyond the normal sense of perpetual falling) by projecting a singularity to the side and slingshotting around it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArkRoyal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArkRoyal">Ark Royal</a></em> is a supercarrier from an era when the predominant battle doctrine was that carriers should be able to hold their own on the front line. Thus, it's heavily armored and armed with powerful mass drivers and nuclear missiles in addition to launching fighters. At the start of the story, modern carriers are more specialised toward the carrier function; by the time of the <em>Warspite</em> sequel trilogy, new carriers are being built in a return to <em>Ark Royal</em>'s specifications.
</li><li> For a non-space example, the USS <em>Maaka-Kakja</em> in the latter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Destroyermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Destroyermen">Destroyermen</a></em> books. The first purpose-build aircraft carrier (well, technically, seaplane tender) commissioned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> (all previous ones are converted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Lemurian</a> Homes). Sturdy in construction (despite being mostly wooden), she also bristles with the lower-caliber guns taken off the sunken IJN <em>Amagi</em>. In <em>Straights of Hell</em>, Admiral Lelaa-Tal-Cleraan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes the carrier into a point-blank confrontation with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Holy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Dominion</a> fleet in order to turn the tide. The massive ship survives but is damaged</span>. For a time, the USS <em>Salissa</em> also counts, since she is fitted with some of <em>Amagi</em>'s higher-caliber guns, although those end up being destroyed in battle, turning her back into a regular carrier/tender.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> books, most human capital ships carry a fighter complement in addition to their weapons. This even applies in the first novel <em>Invasion</em>, set during humanity's pre-interstellar years. A typical cruiser (since this is a Russian novel, a heavy cruiser is equivalent to what a Western sci-fi author would call a battleship) carries several dozen aerospace fighters, and even a frigate is expected to carry at least a pair of them (corvettes generally don't, but they're never actually described in detail). Since, at the time, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a>'s primary tasks include protecting Earth and the Solar System colonies from asteroids and act as a rapid reaction force against terrorists and rogue states on Earth, the fighters are very important. After the failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Faata</a> invasion (whose own huge starship does not qualify, as it lacks weapons of its own, relying on its armada of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Anti Matter</a>-armed battle modules), humans study the remains of their craft and build their own starships, kilometer-long cruisers with powerful weapons (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon">forward-mounted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Anti Matter</a> gun) and capable of launching over a hundred fighters each. The frigate commanded by the second novel's protagonist carries two fighters, which can also be piloted remotely.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NamelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NamelessWar">Nameless War</a></em> A number of battleships and cruisers are hastily retrofitted to carry fighters to provide an additional layer of defense against enemy missiles. Not all officers look upon this with favor since until they are launched fueled and armed fighters are effectively bombs pressed up against their ships.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eldraeverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eldraeverse">Eldraeverse</a></em> has carrier-battlecruisers that have both integral armaments and Autonomous Kill Vehicles (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Droness</a> that can act as AI-guided kinetic missiles), but they're intended for independent operations such as anti-piracy patrols. For engagements that warrant multiple ships the Empire of the Star prefers fleets comprised of several types of specialist ship, heavily armored ships of the plane guarding carriers with tens of thousands of AKVs.

<ul><li> The eponymous ships (as well as the one ship whose name is in the title) of the original series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> (1978). No doubt the series, and its eponymous ships are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>. Virtually every similar ship to come after in other fiction was inspired by some degree by the original <em>Galactica</em> and her fellow Battlestars.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Colonial battlestars, of course. In the first Cylon War they were on the back foot the entire time, defending their homeworlds (in contrast to the Cylons, who had no fixed home to defend). The Battlestar is as much, if not more, geared towards defense as offense — hence the massive volume of armor and point defense systems, reflecting the fact that it might have to hold its ground and absorb everything thrown at it, in order to shield its protectees. The role <em>Galactica</em> played at Ragnar — throwing up a near-impenetrable barrier between the Cylons and the fleet — can probably be regarded as the exact job it was designed for. By the time of the Fall, the Colonials possessed various types of battlestars:
<ul><li> The Jupiter-class (<em>Galactica</em>'s ship class) was big, armored and could lay down flak suppression barrages to defend itself from enemy missiles. A full-strength Jupiter battlestar had a crew of 5,000 plus onboard Marines and could carry around 80 Vipers. Due to Cylon infiltration of computer systems, Jupiter classes did not have networked computers and relied on manual operation for many ship functions, such as Viper landings and weapons control. Despite its age, Jupiter classes proved to be incredibly resilient and durable. Despite the fact that it was about to be decommissioned, the <em>Galactica</em> was able to hold the Colonial fleet together throughout the second war.
</li><li> The Mercury-class (<em>Pegasus</em>' ship class) was the top of the line at the time of the Fall of the Twelve Colonies. Substantially larger than the Jupiter-class (coming in at 5780 feet long, while the Jupiter was 4700 feet long) but having half the crew at 2,500, the Mercury relied more heavily on automation and computer control than the earlier Jupiter classes, allowing for a smaller crew complement. It relied so much so that Mercury-class battlestars utilized ECM jamming to protect from missile attacks (as evidenced by Pegasus lacking dorsal and ventral batteries like Galactica) but made up for that with a far larger Viper complement of 200. <em>Pegasus</em> survived the Fall mostly by pure luck, but was very powerful once they were ready for the Cylons' tactics again.
</li><li> The Valkyrie-class battlestar was one of the smallest ship classes in Colonial service, yet made up the majority of the pre-Fall Colonial Fleet. 1/3 the size of a Jupiter-class, the Valkyrie nonetheless had significant firepower and could deploy Vipers at a far more rapid pace than other battlestars because its launch tubes faced forwards rather than to the sides as with the Mercury and Jupiter-classes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cylon Basestars, on the other hand, are a subversion. Although they're not dedicated missile/fighter carriers, they tend much more towards carriers than battleships, being thin-skinned and reliant on standoff missiles and Raiders to do damage. In terms of sheer firepower and survivability in a ship-to-ship engagement, battlestars are consistently depicted as superior, with even the obsolete <em>Galactica</em> being able to outfight them. This is most likely due to differing design philosophies: The Cylons had the initiative in both wars, plus had the advantage of having no fixed home to defend. As a result, the basestar is a purely offensive platform, designed to support the raiders that are its primary weapons — much like an aircraft carrier. Cylon raiders are FTL-capable, so basestars can lurk well behind the front lines, and just jump to a new rendezvous point if they are threatened. Battlestars have to go right to the front, and stay there, in order to support their STL Vipers. This leaves them vulnerable, since FTL allows an enemy to launch a point-blank range attack without warning. Consequently, battlestars have to have armor and lots of point defenses, and have the ability to fight back in the event that its Vipers are otherwise engaged.
</li><li> The novel <em>The Cylons' Secret</em> gives the following explanation: Because of Cylons overtaking computers, fighters had to be piloted by humans, but there were not enough pilots to match the numbers of Cylons. Thus the battlestar was born, which could assist fighters with its firepower. Standard tactics were for Vipers to provide cover against Raiders until the battlestar got in close range with the basestar, which could then be obliterated in a short-range slugging match.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most ships have at least some fighter complement, and have a large array of beam weapons. In general, the fighters primarily attack other fighters, and get in damage on the capital warships where they can to make it easier for the bigger ships to win the fight, as fighter weaponry really isn't powerful enough to outright kill capital warships on their own.
</li><li> The <em>Excalibur</em> in the spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crusade">Crusade</a></em> implements a new design that reduces the ship's vulnerability. This is especially evident with the <em>Omega</em>-class destroyers, whose hangar is at the front of the ship, giving the enemy a clear shot at the vulnerable innards. The <em>Excalibur</em> launches fighters by extending a crane of sorts that has StarFuries attached to it. The ship also has the hangar at the front, but it is normally closed during battle, only opening to receive the fighters after the end of the fight.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> adds both dedicated carriers, as some fighter-using races tend to have their carriers (in addition to the fighters of the larger ships) too small to carry offensive weaponry, and a few battlestars:
<ul><li> Earth's <em>Avenger</em>'s Alpha version had both a 48 Starfuries wing and an impressive suite of plasma and laser weapons to jump in the fray and wreck enemy ships alongside its 'furies. As exercises and a bit of battle experience suggested otherwise, it was quickly replaced by the Beta version that replaced the lasers with more Interceptors defense guns, and as soon as they were developed the Gamma version replaced the light plasma cannons with pulse cannons (packing less of a punch but able to serve as point defense weapons) and only keeping the medium ones as a cost-cutting measure, with the two that survived the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">Earth-Minbari War</a> and the brief period of overuse that followed it being upgraded to the Delta version that, among other things, completed the transition to pulse cannons.
</li><li> The <em>Poseidon</em>-class supercarrier carries a gigantic 96 fighters and having weapons mostly suited for defense.
</li><li> The <em>Omega</em> Delta, a variant of the <em>Omega</em>-class destroyer trading guns for doubling the fighter wing, is built specifically to replace the <em>Avenger</em>, as the <em>Poseidon</em> was just too large to be practical in most situations.
</li><li> The Cascor have the habit of putting fighters in any combat-capable ships as the main combat arm, so every single one of their ships. They had the largest carriers in the setting until Earth built the <em>Poseidon</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em>Saratoga</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em>. As the series centers around the pilots of an embarked fighter squadron, the <em>Saratoga</em> and its sister ships tend towards the "up-gunned carrier" end of this trope, though with their ability to also embark and deploy ground troops, perhaps the closest analogy is to a modern day amphibious assault ship.
</li><li> This is a staple of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>:
<ul><li> The Goa'uld Ha'tak motherships carrying Death Gliders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>.
</li><li> The Wraith Hiveships carrying Wraith Darts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>.
</li><li> For the Tau'ri, the X-303 <em>Prometheus</em>, first of the line, and the the BC-304 class, like the <em>Daedalus</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, carry a contingent of F-302 fighters.
</li><li> The Ancients' City Ships (i.e. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Atlantis</a></em>) also qualify with their Gateships/Puddle Jumpers. Interestingly, their <em>Aurora</em>-class battleships don't fit this trope, as they don't carry Puddle Jumpers. However, given that their primary weapons are swarms of guided drones, this makes sense.
</li><li> Replicator ships go whole hog on this as they are made entirely of Replicators, as are all weapons they use — so their missiles are basically fighters.
</li><li> The Ori Warships also carry small fighters.
</li><li> Of the frequently seen ships, the only ones that do not seem to follow the trope are the Asgard ships. (That's probably got something to do with the fact that the Asgard don't have the manpower for combat pilots.)
</li><li> The <em>Destiny</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>. It had (at least) one armed and operational shuttle, and looks to be overloaded with guns including a giant triple-barreled main gun... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">good luck getting any of them to fire though</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Naka'i</a>, also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">SG-U</a></em>, have ships that fall into this trope. Their big blocky destroyers appear to be capable of launching fighter craft that swarm and overwhelm enemy ships with their sheer numbers rather than out-and-out firepower.
</li><li> The Berserk Drone command ships also carry (and control) a bunch of drones.
</li></ul></li><li> The title ship from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em>. While the slipfighters (you can guess by the name that they're FTL-capable) are designed to be piloted by living beings, there's nothing stopping them from being piloted remotely using VR goggles, as Tyr often does in the first season. Of course, when you send a single slipfighter to hold off dozens of enemy fighters, you're probably better off being inside <em>Andromeda</em>'s thick armor than in a flimsy fighter cockpit. This has more to do with the fact that the <em>Andromeda</em>, for most of the series, is operating with a crew that doesn't even qualify as a "skeleton crew". Though since there's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">Subspace Ansible</a> in the series fighters need to stick close to the Andromeda while under remote control, and combat usually takes place at distances of several light-minutes.
</li><li> Largely avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>. While many ships carry a small contingent of shuttlecraft which are the same size as small fighters, there are few ships that even resemble dedicated battlecarriers. Those few include the <em>Scimitar</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em>, the <em>Akira</em>-Class, and the non-existent "Warship <em>Voyager</em>". Some ships that are called fighters are more akin to corvettes. (The shuttlecraft themselves often became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">Forgotten Phlebotinum</a>.)
<ul><li> That being said, as mentioned above, the <em>Enterprise</em>-D would fit the exploratory type of battlestar. The <em>Galaxy</em>-class is designed to be Starfleet's most formidable Starship class, with a full 360 degree arc of fire for its phaser banks and is capable of firing salvos of photon torpedoes. In addition, it carries a large complement of shuttles for transporting VIPs and conducting away missions.
</li><li> The lack of "space fighters" in Star Trek is mainly due to production costs and the laws of physics. In TOS, it was hard enough to afford the SFX for phasers, photon torpedoes, and a single shuttlecraft. In the movies, the reason was science advisor (and NASA engineer) Jesco von Puttkamer, who pointed out that physics doesn't allow fighters to maneuver in vacuum the way they do in atmosphere, never mind That Other Sci-Fi Movie Franchise over at 20th Century-Fox. To put it simply, anything a "space fighter" can do in an actual space battle, a guided missile can probably do better, not to mention cheaper. (It doesn't need a pilot, it can be stored in a magazine, and you don't have to worry about recovering it after you've used it.) Starships in ST, TV or movies, are basically the space-going equivalent of modern guided-missile cruisers, like the U.S. Ticonderoga class or the Russian Kirov class. Their job is to use long-range, precision-guided missiles (the photon torpedoes) to achieve "stand-off kills". Their phaser banks are technically secondary weapons, roughly equivalent to the cruisers' 5" (or in the Kirov's case, 100mm) turret guns, or their rapid-fire Close-In Weapon Systems for defense against the other side's anti-ship missiles. (It's interesting that only the Star Fleet Battles game ever picked up on this point.) The fact that they tend to end up in point-blank phaser duels more often than not is mainly due to Rule of Cool plus, frankly, writers who Did Not Read The Manual. (Yes, the Writer's Guide for The Original Series explains all this.)
</li><li> The Federation actually <em>does</em> have dedicated starfighters, but they've only been seen in passing during huge fleet battle scenes in <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. Part of this may be due to the fact that Starfleet, philosophically, is not a pure military but a hybrid military/science/exploration/diplomacy organization. Starfighters would be used primarily in full warfare situations. Even making the USS <em>Defiant</em> as a dedicated warship was a controversial choice — though it shows what Starfleet can make when they set their mind to it. The <em>Defiant</em> is officially classed as an "Escort" (in the Destroyer sense), but is capable of engaging ships well above its size class: it can fight enemy Cruisers and Battleships on a near-even footing (successfully fighting off an <em>Excelsior</em>-class that was trying to capture it), and its high maneuverability can even give it a fair chance against enemy Dreadnaughts. And it's only got four decks and a crew of about fifty people. Of course, it was designed as a next-generation Borg-buster, filled with cutting edge technology — imagine what Starfleet could do if they tried to build a battleship at these specs.
</li><li> The new Star Trek movies do pick up on this, however. The scene at the beginning with the <em>Kelvin</em> and the <em>Narada</em> shows the use of phaser turrets to act as a point-defense weapon. Torpedoes are the main artillery for both the <em>Kelvin</em> and the <em>Enterprise</em>.
</li><li> Screenwriter and sci-fi author <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidGerrold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidGerrold">David Gerrold</a> also stated in his standalone works that the distances involved in real space warfare would be too great for the idea to work, and consequently submarine warfare was a more accurate analogy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanTiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanTiga">Ultraman Tiga</a></em> has the <em>Artdessei</em>, a carrier battleship capable of carrying three GUTS Wing fighters and packing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> had several "carrier" starships with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">spinal mount weapons</a> and fighters or gunboat/corvette-style "Battle Riders". This was also true of the <em>Tigress</em>-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">dreadnought</a>, and indeed most Imperial cruisers and battleships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has a few.
<ul><li> In its grand tradition of never doing anything subtle, they're build in sizes that put everyone else on this page to shame, with windows alone being the size of the Empire State Building. Cannons aren't any smaller, though they notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture">use manual labor to load the cannon shells</a>. The Imperial Mars Class Battlecruiser is a pretty good example, easily 10+ kilometers long.
</li><li> <em>Gloriana</em>-class battleships are so large, the smallest of which is still 20 kilometers long, that they are a class of their own. Only 20 were ever made, one for each Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade, and each an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> tailored to their Primarch's request, which inevitably turned them into their respective legion's flagship.
</li><li> Then there is of course the Eldar Craftworlds which are planetoid-sized Battlestars capable of launching fleets of "ordinary" Battlestars.
</li><li> Since fighter-sized vessels (not frigates) in WH40K are often not FTL-capable, they are usually launched from a nearby carrier, some of which are quite heavily armed. Also, "stand alone" battlegroups such as Space Marine Battle Barges carry their own squadrons of fighters.
</li><li> In <em>Battlefleet Gothic</em> game waves of bombers are powerful enough to destroy a battleship. Hence fighters are required to counter the bombers. However, the biggest carrier, the Emperor class, is still technically a battleship, and carries only marginally less weapon batteries (total; it can actually concentrate more firepower to one side due to most of it being carried in dorsal turrets) than the Retribution class, which is a dedicated "ship of the line". The difference is mostly the Emperor's lack of lances.
</li><li> It should also be noted that many WH40K races are extremely keen on boarding actions and battleships can carry varying number of boarding pods to launch at enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseWikiWordsInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseWikiWordsInTheFuture">WarShips</a>. Where plain old JumpShips are essentially immobile and unarmed targets only capable of ferrying DropShips from one star to the next due to about 95% of their mass being dedicated to their K-F drive alone, WarShips employ special "compact" cores that only weigh up about half as much and thus leave plenty of tonnage free to fill with maneuvering drives, guns, cargo, an organic fighter wing or two, more guns...and they can <em>still</em> carry DropShips with their own weapons and potential fighter assets just the same. (Just don't try to maneuver with the droppers still docked. You don't have magic "inertia dampeners" in this universe, so trying to accelerate at even 1G would basically turn your WarShip into a skyscraper with thousands-of-tons weights hanging from its sides by their docking collars...if your fleet is to go anywhere in-system, the DropShips will have to fly side-by-side with their big brother under their own power.) They're pretty rare in most eras of the game: they're flat out extinct through the Succession Wars in the Inner Sphere and post-Word of Blake Jihad era they've been relegated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> status because only a couple of the major factions have more than one or two and nobody still has the technical ability to easily build replacement parts, much less new warships. This was because the game's lead developer considered them to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">GameBreakers</a>.
</li><li> One of the sample ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a>: Spaceships</em> is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">dreadnought</a> that carry 100,000 tons of other ships inside, the idea being that it can carry its own escort fleet from place to place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JovianChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JovianChronicles">Jovian Chronicles</a></em>: The Jovian Godsfire-class super carrier and the CEGA Poseidon-class battleship. Somewhat justified that both were originally designed as battleships, but had exo and fighter bays added later on. The later Valiant and Majestic carriers qualify due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">spinal lasers</a>.
</li><li> The battleships of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em> exemplify this trope, with the greatest firepower in the game <em>and</em> large (for the game — around a dozen) fighter contingents. "Historically" only the Klingons built them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">they aren't very successful</a>, but they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">just so cool</a> that every race gets a conjectural battleship and the Klingons get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">a conjectural super-battleship</a> in one of the expansions.
<ul><li> Many of the larger Hydran ships also fit the model, as the Hydrans are very fighter-happy and include them on most ships (even their tiny police ship carries fighters and launch tubes to get them out there fast).
</li><li> Also Space Control Ships, with their battleship level firepower and the ability to launch both fighters and "Fast Patrol Ships" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">basically PT boats</a>). One even includes a sensor scout in the mashup to be a SUPER Space Control Ship. Of course, it still only carries a dozen fighters and six <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PFs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PFs">P Fs</a>.
</li><li> <em>Star Trek: Starfleet Command</em>, being based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em> has these too.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightImperium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TwilightImperium">Twilight Imperium</a></em> War Suns both pack a lot of firepower and can carry fighters.

The cruiser unit looks suspiciously like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> but can't carry fighters.

While Carriers have no weapons and Battleships have no drones by default, but they have a couple Omni-Slots that can be upgraded with either.

<ul><li> All M1 carrier class ships in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> games are armed to the teeth, and carry dozens of fighters. They'll still be eaten alive by M2 destroyers (sometimes even by M7 frigates!) if the fighters aren't launched or get gunned down by flak arrays. This is largely because they lack the shielding and laser generator capacity of M2s. But the Split M7 Panther introduced in <em>X3: Terran Conflict</em> is a classic (if miniaturized) battlestar: it carries 32 fighters (much higher than ships of its class) while still being fast and fairly heavily armed.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth">X Rebirth</a></em> eschews the traditional ship classification of previous games, but most combat capital ships are battlestars to varying degrees, albeit using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer">Drone Deployers</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighters</a>. The ultimate battlestar is the Arawn, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">multi-kilometer long</a> carrier, can carry several hundred drones and has mounting points for <em>seventy</em> turrets, several of which are within its cavernous interior. Cheaper, specialized ships like the Taranis eschew some drone carrying capacity in favor of bigger guns.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">Olympus Mons</a> is the only ship actually designated as a carrier, and is easily the most dangerous combat spacecraft in the game.
</li><li> <em>Carrier Command: Gaea Mission</em> shows a seabourne version, with both sets of MANTA aerial and WALRUS amphibious craft, and flak and plasma cannons (as well as the Hammerhead missile). Notably, it can't entirely hold its own in close combat, needing to deploy WALRUS' in order to counter hostile WALRUS' since its guns can't aim down at the water.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>: The Covenant assault carrier (a 5.3-kilometer behemoth), as well as the 29km supercarrier revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Reach</a></em>. Most human ships can do both jobs as well — but they are usually called "cruisers" or "frigates", and are tiny in comparison (1,191 and 490 meters respectively, though actual human carriers are larger at three kilometers).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, the 5.7-kilometer UNSC <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.halopedia.org/images/0/0c/Infinity_fud_scale.jpg">Infinity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em> is a fully-fledged Battlestar. Armed to the teeth with four mass drivers, twenty-six <em>thousand</em> missiles and hundreds of fighter escorts, the ship is so big that it can carry ten frigates <em>internally</em>. The <em>Infinity</em> is essentially a small fleet of its own, capable of smashing a Covenant fleet with laughable ease — in one case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">quite literally</a>.
</li><li> And then there is <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.halopedia.org/Mantle%27s_Approach">Mantle's Approach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Didact's</a> personal flagship. At its longest, the <em>Approach</em> is a staggering three hundred seventy-one kilometers, matched only by the Covenant holy city High Charity in scope and grandeur. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also insists that <em>Mantle's Approach</em> is nowhere close to being the largest warship in the Forerunners' arsenal. The only thing it's missing are the space fighters, but this is compensated for by the fact that the <em>Approach</em> is carrying a Forerunner superweapon <em>and has a minimum crew requirement of one Forerunner to fly the damn thing</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>, as Mothership and carrier-type vessels have only a few small point defense weapons (though they compensate with the ability to quickly build their own fighters and even warships). That said, a few non-playable factions do in fact use these:
<ul><li> The "Needle" motherships of the Kadeshi are capable of spewing hordes of fighters <em>and</em> firing at least two or more higher end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Ion Beams</a> each. They're also among the few ships in the game you can't capture and incorporate into your own fleet.
</li><li> In the first game the Bentusi Tradeships show powerful and fast-firing ion cannons that easily outclass <em>anything</em> in the games, and in the semi-sequel, <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em>, they turn out to carry frighteningly powerful fighters to boot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And this is the <em>demilitarized version</em></span>.
</li><li> The first time you encounter the Turanic Raiders their carrier only launches fighters and corvettes and retreats after you finished destroying them, only using her point defense guns if you attack her with your own corvettes. When you meet her again, she attacks the Mothership with two ion cannons, and if you didn't build or capture a few frigates before the battle you're toast.
</li><li> <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em> also features this for the player faction's mothership <em>Kuun Lan</em>: it's got six heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">mass drivers</a> that are about equivalent to a <em>heavy cruiser's</em> gun armament, and it later upgrades them to energy cannons and acquires the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Siege</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Cannon</a>. This goes some way towards balancing the fact that you can't manufacture frigates or capital ships until quite late in the campaign compared to the previous installment.
</li><li> Much to the players' trouble, the Beast Mothership from <em>Cataclysm</em> is based on the <em>Kuun Lan</em> (specifically, it started out as its original hangar module infected by the Beast, and still carried the original schematics and was upgraded first to match them and then on its own way). It doesn't have a siege cannon, only an infection beam that subvert enemy ships.
</li><li> In <em>Homeworld 2</em> battlecruisers can't <em>manufacture</em> fighters like Carriers or the Mothership, but they do have facilities where fighters can dock and repair.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> had this in several games, including the second game's TCS <em>Concordia</em>, armed with a full carrier wing, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Phase Transit Cannon</a> which would kill other ships in a single shot no matter their size, and eight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">Antimatter</a> cannons.
<ul><li> Many warships of destroyer size and larger also have integral fighter wings, albeit with rather fewer fighters than dedicated carriers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> III</em> introduces the Kilrathi dreadnaught, an enormous (22 km) warship with a carrier's complement of fighters and numerous weapons, including anti-ship missiles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> IV</em> features super-<em>carriers</em>, the <em>Vesuvius</em> class, absolutely humongous ships (e.g. your base ship, the <em>Intrepid</em>, is absolutely <em>dwarfed</em> by them) designed to carry <em>ten</em> fighter wings, with a large number of point-defense weapons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">anti-capship guns</a> (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a>), and such tough armor that to destroy one requires flying into the fight deck and trashing its innards. Oh and to add, these behemoths can <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">turn on a dime</a></em>. There are no super-weapons incorporated in the design... fortunately, since it's used <em>against</em> you.
</li><li> Although it doesn't start off as such by design, after the <em>TCS Midway</em> acquires the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">fleet-killing plasma cannon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">from an alien ship</a> in <em>Prophecy</em>, it fits this trope. Too bad that in one later mission, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it becomes a one-use-only weapon after it fires the first time, which ends up cruelly subverting the trope. In one "You've lost the game" scenario during the final mission, the <em>Midway</em> fires its cannon in an attempt to destroy the alien fleet warping through a gate, but ends up destroying itself in the process thanks to a power overload.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much anything <em>Destroyer</em>-class or bigger in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em> series comes with a bunch of fighters (it's never specified exactly how many, but pretty much "lots"; probably hundreds) plus beam cannons to take on other enemy warships.
<ul><li> There is a few hints here and there that <em>some</em> of the larger of the smaller-than-Destroyer ship-classes can carry fighters. Considering the Terrans and Vasudans have no ships larger than a Destroyer in the first game, and that Destroyers explicitly can carry several wings of fighters...
<ul><li> The GTVA Colossus is explicitly 12 times the volume of a Shivan <em>Lucifer</em>-class destroyer, (the in-game model is about 3 times the size of the GTD Orion) and carries 240 fighters and bombers in total.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Pointedly avoided in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingsOfDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingsOfDawn">Wings of Dawn</a></em> mod, where almost all capital ships are either a carrier that carries a lot of fighters, but not many guns, or a battleship with lots of guns and no fighter bay. The only true battlestars are the Nordera <em>Battleaxe</em> cruiser and the Hertak <em>Armageddon</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">dreadnought</a>.
</li><li> All ships with fighter complements in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a></em> series have more firepower than other ships their faction has access to. This is probably because fighter bays can be installed on any ship with enough room, and anything big enough to carry much heavy firepower tends to be enormous anyways.
<ul><li> The be-all and end-all of the <em>EV Nova</em> battlestars is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Polaris Raven</a>, a 1.2 km, vaguely butterfly-shaped ship literally built around its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> and a fighter bay with greater capacity than anything else in the game. For the most part, it's weirdly subverted in <em>Nova</em> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">space fighters</a> are fairly useless: at best, you use them as a distraction for the AI and make the kill yourself. The exception is with the Polaris, whose Manta fighter mounts a main gun worthy of a destroyer, making it a credible threat to enemy capital ships in numbers.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Great Fox</em> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starfox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starfox">Star Fox</a></em> games. Albeit smaller than most examples, but it has the same philosophy; houses a squadron of four fighters, and has some pretty big anti-starship guns.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> game, virtually every mission, has you launching from some battleship or other. They both join in the fray as lumbering, slow (but rather durable) ships of the line, and provide a place for weakened mechs to dock and repair/refuel. The above examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> are common, as well as originals such as the <em>Hagane</em> and <em>Shirogane</em>. The <em>Kurogane</em> even has a giant <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill">drill</a></em> on the front to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">ram things</a></em>. Also, if any of these are shot down, it's instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> for you.
<ul><li> W's Valstork goes the extra mile by attaching one of its robot contingent, the Valhawk, to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> to amplify its power, and later actually combining with the Valhawk to form the giant ship-robot Valguard.
</li><li> And then there's the Iron Gear from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle">Xabungle</a></em>, which in addition to packing an eight-inch gun, can just turn into a hundred-meter-tall robot and <em>step on you</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with a little in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>; many ships of all sizes and shapes are capable of launching and operating unmanned combat or utility drones, whether those ships are frigate-sized asteroid miners or kilometer-long warships packing high-powered beam lasers. But only <em>true</em> carriers (which cannot carry <em>any</em> ballistic, beam, or missile weaponry) can launch <strong>manned</strong> fighters, which are significantly more powerful than the unmanned drones and can be sent off to escort other players whilst carriers sit far away from trouble. Carriers can still mount some pretty formidable defenses, though, and their ability to repair and restore the shields of other ships can make them a fairly significant passive threat even without their fighters in play.
<ul><li> Then there's the Mothership/Supercarrier and the even bigger Titan. They can carry <em>players.</em>
<ul><li> Supercarriers had their ability to carry clone vats dropped and titans had their ability to carry drones dropped as well. The Titan could still be considered this trope taken to logical extremes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Naval Ops</a></em> series, there is a class of ship called the Battlecarrier. It can mount a moderate number of battleship-class guns and has a flight deck to allow a likewise moderate amount of planes (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">ducks</a>) to be deployed in battle.
<ul><li> These ships are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">based off the</a> converted <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_class_battleship">Ise-class battleships<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; desperately short of carriers, the IJN converted <em>Ise</em> and <em>Hyuga</em> into battlecarriers. Battlecarriers ingame are a lot more successful than their real life counterparts ever were (see Real Life for further details), but are outmatched by properly outfitted battleships, in part because aircraft in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Naval Ops</a></em> series aren't as powerful as their real life counterparts.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by default in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/O-Game" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/O-Game">O-Game</a></em>. Small fighters do exist but they are implied to fly alongside all the others ships in an attack fleet rather than in carriers which raises serious logistical questions.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a></em> series, the Ur-Quan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">Dreadnought</a> can launch swarms of fighters to pick apart any ships its main gun can't obliterate. It's obviously meant to <em>look</em> almost exactly like the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica</a>... well, if it were green, and crewed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> who are the antagonists rather than the heroes.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent, the Orz Nemesis (with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a>) and Chenjesu Broodhome (with remote-controlled drones) also qualify.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a></em>, as capital ships level up, they gain the ability to house squadrons of fighters or bombers. Even the capital ships labeled as "carriers" still have enough firepower to, at least, fight off frigates and cruisers, although another capital ship will outgun it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Advent</a> <em>Halcyon</em>-class carriers are armed with powerful beam weapons, allowing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> on par with the other Advent ships.
<ul><li> Averted with the cruiser-type escort carriers, which have no weapons beyond their ability to construct and launch 1-3 wings of fighters or bombers.
</li><li> It should be pointed out, though, that the Advent use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Drones</a> instead of actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighters</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em> plays with this extensively:
<ul><li> There are no true fighters or bombers, only assault shuttles, planetary bombers, and unmanned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drones</a>. Most of these are riders mounted outside the ship rather than launched from an internal hangar or bay.
</li><li> Destroyer or cruiser carriers lack the firepower to be true line combatants. The closest are dreadnought carriers. The Morrigi (who else) flagship exemplifies this trope.
</li><li> One twist comes from the Morrigi, who mount drones on more ship types than other races that need special drone carrier sections.
</li><li> Another comes from the Tarka, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">admittedly late-game</a> Hunter Battle Riders are <em>cruiser-sized</em> — normal riders are dwarfed by destroyers — with the attendant firepower that implies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">Sequel Escalation</a> is in effect for the sequel, where all the races have destroyer-sized riders inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em>, while the Liir-Zuul alliance has gone up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">dreadnought</a></em> riders on Leviathans. Also, with Kingfisher modules, all dreadnoughts can carry some riders, though the dedicated carriers naturally do better.
</li></ul></li><li> Military starships are divided into four main types in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">Dreadnoughts</a>, are behemoths averaging over a kilometer long. Like all ships in this universe, they have a lot of broadside batteries (the <em>Kilimanjaro</em>-class, for example, has 26 broadside guns per deck, in three decks, on either side, for a total of 156 guns), point-defense laser turrets (GARDIAN), and torpedo tubes, but their main weapons are spinal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">mass accelerators</a> running 90% of the ship's length. They're capable of taking down the shields (it spam projectiles hitting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiroshimaAsAUnitOfMeasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiroshimaAsAUnitOfMeasure">double-digit kilotons</a> every two seconds) of any ship in Citadel space.
<ul><li> As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, any ship can be classified as a dreadnought if it's fitted with powerful enough guns. Outfitting all civilian ships (including 3 massive liveships used for all food production) with the powerful Thanix cannons counts, although the quarians claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Citadel Law</a> doesn't apply to them since they were effectively kicked out of Citadel Space centuries ago. Joker, normally a very light-hearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRelief">Comic Relief</a> character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">angrily points out</a> how irresponsible it is to put such powerful weapons on otherwise defenseless civilian ships, making them irresistible (and indefensible) targets rather than noncombatants.
</li></ul></li><li> Carriers, similar in size to Dreadnoughts but without the spinal guns, instead making room for more hangar bays for fighters (they presumably do still have the broadside guns, point-defense turrets, and torpedo tubes though). Similar to modern aircraft carriers (a well-placed shot will gut the carriers, and general strategy is to defend them at all costs). An entirely human innovation and one of many examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>. Because Carrier construction is not limited by the Treaty of Farixen (see the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), the human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Systems Alliance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">builds as many of them as it can</a>. In this case it's more of "only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInsane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInsane">Humanity Is Insane</a> enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> a ship with anti-fighter lasers to a point were they overheat allowing heavy bombers to come in".
</li><li> Cruisers, mid-sized ships. They're basically just dreadnoughts, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">volumetrically scaled down to 1/2 to 1/8 the average size</a> (i.e. they have the same dimensions and average 500-700 meters instead of 900-1,000+). They have smaller versions of the same weapons, including the spinal gun, and also carry a small number of fighters, but not as much as a carrier. They lack a dedicated hangar and therefore fit them into the spaces between layers of armor. This is the closest that Citadel Space has to the Battlestar, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereintheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereintheManual">in-game codex</a> calls them "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">the poor bloody infantry</a>" of space warfare...
</li><li> Frigates, which carry no fighters and instead operate in "wolf-pack" flotillas. They lack batteries of broadside guns and, while they do possess a spinal gun, they're too small (on average 200-ish meters) for said guns to have either the length or power generation to penetrate the shielding of bigger ships (per the codex, all ships including frigates have spinal guns that can spam the equivalent of nukes every two seconds, it's just that "nuke" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">is a rather broad range</a>). As a result, their main weapons are their point-defense lasers (frigates are often deployed as anti-fighter escorts for the more heavily armed cruisers) and their torpedo tubes (which launch masses of "disruptor torpedoes", which tear apart targets on a space time molecular level via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">Minovsky Physics</a>).
</li><li> Minor military ship types include corvettes (slightly smaller frigates, mostly used for patrol and enforcement instead of fleet combat) and destroyers (only referenced once in a couple novels), but we get little information on them. The smaller Reaper varieties are classed as "destroyers", but it's unknown whether the Citadel races classed them that way because of their size (at 160 meters in length and fairly bulky, they're about the same mass as a frigate) or because of their firepower (they're noted to have cruiser-level main guns and shielding disproportionately tough for their size, but seem to lack any sort of torpedo tubes or broadsides). Or both.
</li><li> The Reapers themselves are classified as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedDreadnought">dreadnoughts</a>", and are absolute <em>monsters</em> in space combat... or ground combat, for that matter. They average over two kilometers long and lack both the broadside batteries and torpedo tubes of "regular" dreadnoughts, but their point-defense turrets are even more potent and their spinal gun is <em>so much more powerful</em> that it hardly matters. More than just taking shields down, any ship, no matter how armored or shielded or powerful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">that is hit by the main spinal gun of a Reaper capital ship will be destroyed almost instantly</a>. Each of them also carries a swarm of Oculus drones for anti-fighter defenses as well, technically making them a battlestar. Given their sheer size they can likely carry more than a one-kilometer carrier too. It helps that the Reapers' "spinal guns" do <em>not</em> run 90% of the ship's length thanks to their Thanix technology, which has their main guns working more like coilguns (main limit is power generation) than railguns (main limit is length).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>, every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Kett Empire</a> ship seen is a Battlestar: like other non-humans, kett seem to have no carrier equivalent, so squadrons simply dock in the decks of other ship types. You can see fighters deploying from those ships in the final space battle. Averaging around a kilometer long, kett ships appear to be cruiser equivalents, but are nowhere near as well-protected (no shielding) or heavily armed (no spinal gun, little to no point-defense, far fewer broadsides) as their smaller equivalents back in Citadel Space. Still, a kilometer-long, heavily-armored, FTL-capable vessel with torpedo tubes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">each capable of launching dozens of tactical nuke-scale torpedoes in mere seconds</a>) and sixteen tactical nuke scale broadside cannons (eight per side in batteries of four) is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormalFishInATinyPond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormalFishInATinyPond">far more than what the Initiative or angara can handle</a>, and seems to have served them well in Andromeda considering they're the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower">Galactic Superpower</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> game <em>Empire at War</em>, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a>: Any Imperial ship bigger than a corvette has several free fighter compliments. The logical conclusion is the <em>Executor</em>, from the expansion, which can launch a squadron every few seconds, on top of being the biggest ship in the game.
</li><li> The <em>Behemoth</em>-class battlecruisers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> act as carriers for <em>Wraith</em>-class fighters, dropships, and other small craft. This is not, however, shown in the game, probably because the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale">unit scaling is way off</a>, showing the fighters to be a third of the size of the battlecruisers.
<ul><li> In the campaign of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em> Raynor's Raiders use a battlecruiser as their base of operations, it's shown to have at least one hangar that fits nearly every other unit in the game and is apparently where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory">mobile starting structures</a> for each mission deploy from.
<ul><li> In one mission of "Heart of the Swarm" the Hyperion is capable of launching "tac fighters" to help deal with swarms of enemies too numerous for just the main guns.
</li></ul></li><li> Protoss carriers are mostly not examples; they carry fighter-bomber drones called Interceptors (that are also built within the carrier's decks) and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">Orbital Bombardment</a>, but according to various EU materials like the Field Manual, they can't use that weapon against other ships and have no armaments for "standard combat." However, Tassadar's flagship <em>Ganthritor</em> plays it straight, being a "super-carrier" with extra weapon emplacements that allows it to engage enemy ships without relying solely on Interceptors. It destroyed an <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080201052345/http://eu.starcraft2.com/features/protoss/carrier.xml">entire squadron<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of terran battlecruisers single-handedly during the Great War.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarcraftIILegacyOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarcraftIILegacyOfTheVoid">Starcraft II Legacy Of The Void</a></em> adds the arkships. Three arkships were created by the Protoss at the height of their civilization as safeguards against extinction. An arkship contains the following: a Protoss Grand Preserver who has the memories of nearly every generation of Protoss before them, an army of Templar warriors kept in stasis, factories capable of producing advanced war machines, weapons capable of cleansing life from planets, and a <em>miniature sun</em> to power it all. By the time <em>Legacy</em> rolls around, only one arkship is left, the <em>Spear of Adun</em>, and the process used to create them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that baffles even the current protoss. This ship serves as the mobile base of operations during the game. By they way, these ships are <strong>74 kilometers long</strong>, and it dwarfs even a <em>Zerg Leviathan</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">Star Patrol</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe">Tachyon: The Fringe</a></em> have cruisers which appear to combine the characteristics of several different classes: speed/maneuverability of a frigate, firepower of a cruiser, and fighter-carrying capability of a carrier. Unfortunately, their capabilities are never shown in the game, which is focused on fighter combat. However, even dedicated carriers appear to have enough firepower to take out frigates with their turrets. During the final Bora mission, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">GalSpan</a> Regional Director Atkins's flagship <em>Zeus</em>, a carrier, blows away the latest Bora frigate with a single volley.
</li><li> The <em>Durandal</em> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> trilogy, a 4,000m-long <strike><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">penis extension</a></strike> sword-shaped battleship belonging to the Kukai Foundation. It possesses advanced weaponry that outstrips even the Federation's special forces and is regularly seen kicking the crap out of fleets of enemy ships. It made its debut in <em>Episode I</em> by <em>ramming</em> an enemy vessel, for crying out loud. It serves as home base for the protagonists for much of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until its absorbed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> Abel's Ark and is turned into a twisted and grisly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>-providing wreck</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> has two carriers for the Klingon side — the Vo'Quv and the Kar'fi; both are battle-stars as the Vo'Quv carries 6 guns, and the Kar'fi 7. The main 'battleship' types in the game carry 8, so they aren't far behind at all, and the Vo'Quv is exceptionally tough. As the updates have passed, more carriers have been added — all of which can carry some guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace">Infinite Space</a></em> has several classes of battleship that have catapults and so can be equipped with fighters. Some cruisers have them as well, but equipping them with fighters is usually less efficient as they have less space to spare.
</li><li> All battleships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> are implied to be Battlestars (at the very least, you can land on them, and I think other fighters do as well). However, fighters are so independent in the game (capable of their own hyperjumps, and often seen prowling on their own all over the Sirius sector) that it's more likely that a battleship is supposed to be <em>escorted into battle by fighters</em>, rather than launch fighters upon entering battle, therefore staying on the very edge of this trope.
<ul><li> The fighters also tend to be incredibly overpowered compared to capital ships. During the campaign, there are plenty of missions where you have to take out cruisers and battleships almost all by yourself. Better hope you packed your torpedo launcher this morning.
</li></ul></li><li> The largest ships in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires">Space Empires</a></em> games are baseships, quite literally moving starbases. Being so spacious, they can accommodate lots of fighters as well as standard ship weaponry.
</li><li> If you've researched or otherwise acquired fighters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a>,</em> you can put them on just about any ship. Since fighters can take quite some time to get to their targets and can be shot down on the way, Battlestars may be more viable than true carriers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler">Star Ruler</a></em> you can tack ship bays together with guns on any spacecraft you design, as well as construction bays to add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory">Mobile Factory</a> ability if you wish. However, since capacity scales with ship size, you will only get useful strikecraft complements with big capships.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Garthan</a> have Light Carriers that periodically launch fighters but are only armed with a pair of fairly weak missile launchers — definitely not suited for close combat. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Urluquai</a> have much heavier carriers that not only launch fighters but can also hold their own with their powerful beam cannons (they're also cloaked until they're right on top of you).

<ul><li> Ships like the <em>Idris</em>-class corvette and destroyers have hangar space for a small number of fighters, but primarily rely on their guns for their offensive punch.

In Days of Ruin/Dark Conflict, the carrier was reworked, replacing the menacing missile battery with a weaker close-range anti-aircraft gun, but also giving it the ability to resupply and repair air units as well as build a short range multi-role plane. Cruisers have extended into quasi-Battlestar status: initially they were an anti-submarine, anti-aircraft ship capable of transporting two helicopters, but as of Dual Strike gained the ability to attack other naval units as well.

<ul><li> The titular Sunrider is a heavily-armed prototype assault carrier, specifically designed to combine the firepower of a battleship with the carrying capacity of a carrier. Its armaments include banks of laser cannons, smaller pulse lasers, numerous anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmechByAnyOtherName">Ryder</a> flak guns, missile and torpedo launchers, heavy kinetic guns and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> called the Vanguard Cannon.

</li><li> Late in the game, PACT starts mass-producing its own Assault Carriers based on the Sunriders design. While they lack the Sunriders Vanguard Cannon and torpedoes, PACT Assault Carriers are otherwise just as heavily-armed and each one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemySummoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemySummoner">can deploy up to ten Ryders in a single battle</a>, making them some of the most dangerous enemy units in the game.

</li><li> The ending animation in <em>Enigma: Rising Tide</em> shows the <em>Bismarck</em> and the <em>Tirpitz</em> being converted into battlecarriers after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">this 'verse</a>'s equivalent of the attack on Pearl Harbor (except here, it's the US Navy performing a sneak attack on the Imperial German fleet at Scapa Flow in occupied Britain with Chancellor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Manfred von Richthofen</a> making a speech eerily similar to FDR's and declaring an end to the age of the battleship). The photo shows the <em>Bismarck</em> with an aft flight deck but still having her two forward 14.96" turrets.
</li><li> All carriers in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestationHarbinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestationHarbinger">Battlestation Harbinger</a></em> have at least a few normal weapon hardpoints besides their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighter</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drone</a> bays. Since the game doesn't limit what weapon scan be mounted onto a hardpoint, there's nothing wrong with flying a light carrier with two squadrons of fighters/drones/bombers, while also mounting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear missile launcher</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">death ray</a>. True, such a ship would likely not have good survivability in close combat due to low HP and shield strength, but she might make for a good mid-range combatant, especially with the fighters keeping the enemy busy. Heavier carriers are more in line with this, featuring tougher ships with more weapon hardpoints and, possibly, more bays.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Strikecraft</a> hangars are special weapons slots only available to cruisers and battleships. They can be pretty well-armed, and armor and shields take up different slots, but still not to the same degree as purely weapons-carrying ships.
<ul><li> The Federations DLC introduces the Juggernaut class, which has six hangars and two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">X-sized weapon slots</a> as well as two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileFactory">shipyards</a> capable of building independent ships.

<ul><li> <em>Ise</em> and <em>Hyuuga</em>, can be remodeled into Aviation Battleships, just like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> counterparts. Additionally, their predecessors <em>Fusou</em> and <em>Yamashiro</em> can also be remodeled in this fashion. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qcpa');"><sup>Historical note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qcpa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qcpa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were plans to remodel the <em>Fusou</em>-class ships after the <em>Ise</em>-class conversions were complete, but urgent needs for surface combatants and a lack of planes prevented this.</span> They lose some firepower (until <em>Fusou</em> and <em>Yamashiro</em> get their second remodel) in exchange for being able to carry seaplane fighter-bombers and anti-submarine auto-gyros. This makes them useful for providing air superiority in situations where a carrier can't be brought, and for fighting submarines where other battleships would be floating targets.
</li><li> <em>Graf Zeppelin</em> and <em>Saratoga</em> (before her remodel) carry heavy cruiser-sized guns, allowing them to attack at night when other carriers cannot.
</li><li> The Abyssals' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Re-class battleship</a> one-ups everything with battleship cannons and armor, a torpedo cruiser's complement of torpedoes and at least 140 fighter-bombers. The elite version has a torpedo launcher that works in the opening torpedo phase, allowing her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">attack in every phase of the battle</a>. The Armored Carrier Demon/Princess' major focus is fighters and dive bombers, with only a single slot for battleship guns. The Southern Demon/War Demon/War Princess only carries fighters, except in her Southern War Demon form where she swaps out one of her guns for a bomber complement.
</li></ul></li><li> Carriers in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarlightTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarlightTactics">Starlight Tactics</a></em> are this, such as the <em>Yangtze River</em> or <em>Xerxes</em> classes. While they can launch a number of fighters, they primarily deal damage with their powerful main guns. They are also heavily armored, allowing them to go toe-to-toe with dedicated battleships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersStarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersStarships">Sid Meier's Starships</a></em> allows you to upgrade systems on the ships of your fleet, which means there's nothing (except cash flow) preventing you from upgrading a ship's fighter bays, as well as the ship's weapons and defenses in order to fit the trope. So, eventually you can have a powerful front-line battleship that can also launch a fighter wing every turn up to a max of 9.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns">Crying Suns</a></em>, all battleships pull double-duty as carriers. How many guns a battleship can mount, and how many squadrons it can deploy at once, varies by class: the Kaos class deploys the most squadrons but has the least guns, the Jericho class has the most guns but deploys the fewest squadrons, and the rest fall somewhere in the middle.
</li><li> The Equinox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarlinkBattleForAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarlinkBattleForAtlas">Starlink: Battle for Atlas</a></em> houses and transports the player's various space fighters.
</li><li> In <em>DarkSpace</em>, this trope is zigzagged.
<ul><li> "Tier 1" ships only have a single role battle role, and "Carrier" is a battle role, so a Tier 1 Carrier is always purely a carrier, with only a few point defense beams of its own.
</li><li> However, Tier 2 ships have two battle roles at once, so most Tier 2 Carriers - such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">UGTO</a>'s Assault Carrier, which packs Torpedo Launchers - are examples.
</li><li> The Tier 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">ICC</a> Dreadnought, the Strike Carrier, may be the Most Triumphant Example for this game. With its three battle roles being Carrier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace">ECM</a>, and Cannons, it's a low-profile sustained damage-dealer carrier-gunboat, with a uniquely powerful shield layout giving it even more enhanced staying power and recoverability in return for the loss of any meaningful armor-based defenses.
</li><li> The iconic UGTO Agincourt Supercarrier, however, is a subversion, as it has more fighter bays than any other ship in space - even more than Command Stations! - but despite being Tier 2, its secondary role is... point defense, meaning it offers incredible coverage, but no additional offensive ability.

<ul><li> Battlestars show up on practically all major sides. With the advent of advanced gravity control and AI present in the series, capital ship battles appear to be decided by who is able to project the most force in as many different ways as possible, with one-trick ponies giving way to ships that can do many things at the same time. The second ship of the protagonists is a decommissioned Tausennigan Thunderhead Superfortress named the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible">Post-Dated Check Loan</a></em>, which fits the trope.
</li><li> Later we get introduced to the human battleplates, which are equally well-fitting. They are in fact rather large mobile cities, with not just fleets of fighters and frigates but also room for thousands of crew members and self-grown food stores that will last indefinitely. They were originally designed to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drops</a>, but could still be used for military defense in their home systems (they were too big for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">wormgates</a>). With the advent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">teraport</a>, battleplates could escape their home system, putting them at the front line of most major conflicts. All human battleplates are named for major asteroid impacts, since those were the events they were designed to prevent. The <em>Tunguska</em> was the first one shown in the series.
</li><li> Petey, of course, has his own battleplates. Except since he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> AI, he doesn't need to bother with crew space; he has rooms on his ships for visiting guests, but the vast majority of the ship is dedicated to weapons. The pleasantly-named <em>Plaited Daisies</em> has an annie-plant larger than the <strong>entire</strong> battleplate <em>Popigai</em>. Annie-plants get better the bigger they are. The <em>Popigai</em> meekly agrees to hand over some prisoners.
</li><li> The (probable) crowning example would be the so-far only seen Tausennigan "plate-class" ships, which includes the species (apparent) flagship <em>Cloak of Untrammelled Dignity</em>. At little over one thousand kilometres in length and a total size of five hundred thousand cubic kilometres, it is roughly about five <em>thousand</em> times larger than the human battleplate <em>Morokweng</em>, one of the larger human battleplates.

The small size of the flight deck meant that their utility as carriers are comparable to that of an escort carrier at best, and due to the lack of both planes and flight crews, their operational use ended up rather unsuccessful, to the point where the ships continued to be employed as pure battleships right up until their career as warships effectively ended during the Battle off Cape Engaño, where they as part of the pitiful remnants of Japanese aircraft carrier forces were overwhelmed by swarms of American fighter-bombers, and suffered the indignity of being reduced to floating anti-aircraft batteries for the remainder of their lives. In retrospect, their seaplanes would have been useful as scouts and anti-submarine patrols (both of which the Japanese <strong>desperately</strong> needed in order to make up for the US Navy's superior radar technology and extensive use of submarines), scenarios where the battleships' guns would be tucked away and therefore not interfere with aircraft operations. But then again, by the time the battleship-carriers came on-line, Japan already had trouble building enough of <em>any</em> plane.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note263m4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note263m4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note263m4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should be noted Japan's original plans were to convert <em>all</em> their battleships except <em>Yamato</em> and <em>Musashi</em> into full-fledged aircraft carriers, but that a lack of resources forced them to make that conversion instead.</span>
<ul><li> The Imperial Japanese Navy operated also two heavy cruisers of the <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone-class_cruiser">Tone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>-class, that had all their main guns mounted forward while their stern was designed to have facilities for launching seaplanes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3p3o3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3p3o3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3p3o3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unlike the other IJN ships, these cruisers were designed from the start for that role using the aircraft for long-range reconnaissance.</span> In 1943 the cruiser <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Mogami_%281934%29#Respite_in_Japan">Mogami<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was modified for a similar role, removing her aft guns in exchange for a deck with rails to operate floatplanes, and there were even <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise-class_battleship#Conversion_to_hybrid_carriers">plans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the IJN to give another old pair of battleships of theirs an <em>Ise</em>-like configuration.
</li><li> Earlier aircraft carriers did approach a "cruiserstar" configuration — American carriers <em>Lexington</em> and <em>Saratoga</em> and the Japanese carriers <em>Akagi</em> and <em>Kaga</em> (all four were converted from capital ships under construction in the wake of the London Naval Treaty: the first three from battlecruisers and <em>Kaga</em> from a battleship) were all fitted with heavy cruiser-caliber big guns and could theoretically fight on equal terms with anything smaller than a battleship or battlecruiser. In reality, the guns were often positioned where they were either of little use or actually <em>detrimental</em> to their aviation facilities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note423uc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note423uc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note423uc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Firing the cruiser guns to the port side by <em>Lexington</em> or <em>Saratoga</em> would have ruined their respective flight decks, and <em>Akagi</em> and <em>Kaga</em> had their big guns moved to casemates just above the stern where they not only were practically useless but also added the threat of a magazine explosion close to the ship's very vulnerable rudder and propellers.</span> and the huge, unarmored flight decks made them vulnerable in a gun fight. The two Japanese carriers went down without any enemy ship getting anywhere near firing distance, while their American counterparts had their big guns removed and replaced with far more useful anti-aircraft or dual-purpose weapons).
</li><li> It is worth noting that defensive armament on late-war aircraft carriers such as the American <em>Essex</em> class would include a battery of 5-inch guns in so-called "Dual Purpose" mounts — designed to engage either attacking aircraft or any smaller enemy ships that got inside their fighter screen. This is, however, more of a result of unified logistics (the Dual Purpose mounts in question are standardized on all new-constructions and extensive reconstructions of frontline warships in the US) than anything else. In practice, it was almost impossible for enemy surface combatants to get close enough to engage an aircraft carrier, due to their combination of being very fast and having dozens of planes on board to spot enemy ships miles away,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57x23');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note57x23" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57x23');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not to mention their usually heavy escort that ranged from destroyers to battleships</span> making these guns' anti-ship capability merely academic in nature. Dual purpose mounts on carriers were used against surface ships in only one engagement: the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar">Battle off Samar,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and only because the escort carriers of Taffy 3 were unable to outrun the Center Force.
</li><li> During the course of World War One a number of Royal Navy capital ships were fitted with flying off platforms mounted on the roofs and gun barrels of the main turrets. These allowed the ships to both carry and launch fighters or scouts. The obvious limitation of this system being that there was nowhere for the aircraft to land, necessitating ditching and the possible loss of the pilot.
</li><li> Similarly to the above example, many interwar and WWII warships larger than a destroyer had equipment to transport and launch seaplanes to be used mainly for scouting and fire control purposes.
<ul><li> They could also be equipped with special fighters fittingly dubbed "catapult fighters". These notably played a role in the attack on Pearl Harbor where they were the only planes America could launch fast enough against the Japanese.
</li><li> As well as catapult bombers, or alternatively equip one of the above with depth charges or bombs. This was actually surprisingly successful, as it allowed battleships and cruisers to score a number of sub kills. While a sub could normally try and fight off a lone plane, in this case surfacing in range of a battleship or cruiser with spotting assistance would be suicidal.
</li></ul></li><li> The US Navy successfully adapted a number of <em>Fletcher</em> and <em>Gearing</em> class destroyers to carry a single aircraft catapult in place of one torpedo launcher. This was mostly intended for recon purposes, but the spotting aircraft could carry depth charges to hunt subs without aid of the mother ship. Other nations tried this with destroyers but the experiments mostly went nowhere. Oddly though, there were some successful corvettes and frigates with aircraft catapults, most notably the preserved Thai corvette HTMS <em>Maeklong.</em>
<ul><li> And all the WWII era USN destroyers undergoing the FRAM upgrade programs had thier torpedo armaments removed to be replaced in part by landing pads for dron helicopters (intended for recon purposes, they could not be armed).
</li></ul></li><li> The British warship HMS <em>Furious</em> also went through a rather impractical phase with a launching deck at the front and a battleship-grade gun at the back, before being eventually fully converted to a flush-deck aircraft carrier that would actually be useful for aircraft operations. Despite her armament, she was very lightly armoured. Along with her sister ships, <em>Glorious</em> and <em>Courageous</em> which also underwent numerous major refits, their designs were not considered a success and earned them the nicknames <em>Curious</em>, <em>Spurious</em> and <em>Outrageous</em>.
</li><li> The first experiments in landing and launching aircraft from ships involved temporary wooden decks being placed across the aft of a battleship or armoured cruiser, which at the time was sufficient due to the aircraft of the time being slow enough to take off and (with assistance of arrestor wires) land on such a short runway. The aft turret wasn't removed, so in theory it could have still been used in an emergency (destroying the flight deck in the process), but since no ships ever went to war in this configuration that wasn't an issue.
</li><li> USS <em>Midway</em> was initially armed was enough secondary guns to repulse destroyer and torpedo boat attacks in addition to her formidable armor. She was initially designed with more than twice the amount she was launched with too. This unusual choice was because it was thought that she would conduct bombing runs deep into mainland Japan to support an invasion, potentially bringing her into the range of the Japanese navy.
</li></ul></li><li> USS <em>White Plains</em> is the only aircraft carrier to have scored a kill with its guns. Well, gun. Ironically, it was very poorly armed compared to any of the above examples, only boasting a single five-inch gun. Luckily for the carrier, said five-inch gun landed a hit on the torpedo tubes of the heavy cruiser <em>Chokai</em>. And since Japanese torpedoes were powered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">ethanol mixed with compressed oxygen</a> and were right next to the engines... boom. She also survived a shelling from the battleship <em>Yamato</em>, despite her nonexistent armor, prior to doing this. This would have been an amazing result for most classes of battleships under similar situations.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6llob');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6llob" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6llob');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is less impressive than it sounds; <em>Yamato</em>'s shells landed just short of <em>White Plains</em> and detonated underwater. The damage still forced the escort carrier to return to the Continental US for repairs shortly afterward.</span>
<ul><li> HMS <em>Unicorn</em> A support carrier, has the distinction of being the only other carrier to carry out an artillery strike, this time on shore targets. Again the irony here is that she was poorly armed compared to many of the other examples on this page. A broadside of four four inch guns, better than "White Planes" but only equivalent to an older model destroyer.
</li></ul></li><li> Also from the IJN, the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-400-class_submarine">I-400<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>-class submarine aircraft carrier. Well armed for a submarine with torpedoes and a deck gun, it also carried a full squadron of three float planes. Given the late nature of the war, it was speculated they would instead execute Kamikaze attack, making it closer to a modern ballistic missile submarine. Alternatively, the planes could carry bombs with biological weapons and use them against population centres such as Los Angeles but thankfully, they never got to this point.
<ul><li> Most other IJN submarines had an hangar to carry one or even two floatplanes for reconnaissance too. Launching procedures were, however, slow consisting of surfacing, opening the hangar's doors, assembling the aircraft(s), moving it outside to take-off, and after returning and retrieving the plane with a crane repeating the process on inverse order once the job was done.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the <em>I-400</em>, but early, the French submarine-cruiser <em>Surcouf</em>. It carried 2 floatplanes, 10 torpedo tubes (6 forward, 4 aft), and 2 8-inch turreted guns. And it was commissioned in 1934!
</li><li> The <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_aircraft_carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov">Admiral Kuznetsov<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is known for being built with a dramatically different approach in mind compared to US aircraft carriers. Unlike these, it carries primary offensive armament in form of ship-to-ship missiles and the fighters it has on board serve defensive rather than power projection purposes. Although it carries a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Cool Plane</a> (the Sukhoi [Su]-33), the ski ramp used for takeoffs seriously limits the loads that they can carry (a trade-off for being less expensive to build and operate than steam catapults), leaving the aircraft limited to air defense rather than offense. However, the design has proved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> in the post-Cold War environment (as Russia, like the US, finds herself in conflicts against countries with no capability nor desire for sea control), and the ship is slated for a refit in which its anti-ship missile launchers will be replaced with a larger hangar to carry more aircraft (mirroring the alterations China made in completing the <em>Kuznetsov</em>'s sister ship <em>Varyag</em> as the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_aircraft_carrier_Liaoning">Liaoning<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>), while the Sukhois will be swapped for the lighter MiG-29Ks. It will likely keep its full load of anti-aircraft missiles, though, so it probably will retain its "battlestar" status. Or at least, it would likely have. As of the end of 2018, the <em>Kuznetsov</em> is no longer seaworthy following a crane collapse in drydock that tore several gaping holes in her superstructure. The Russian Navy declared her a total loss as restoring her to a seaworthy state would cost far, far more than they could afford. Ironically, she had put to port in order to carry out the aforementioned refits and upgrades, as well as desperately needed repairs to her ancient powerplant.
<ul><li> Also worthy of mention are their smaller and less capable predecessors, the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_class_aircraft_carrier">Kiev<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>-class carriers. These carried a battery of very powerful anti-ship missiles and a varying fit of anti-aircraft missiles, and operated an air wing of helicopters and V/STOL aircraft. Their missiles made them formidable as missile cruisers but the very troublesome Yak-38 fighters curtailed their effectiveness as a carrier. Those were supposed to be replaced by the significantly more capable Yak-141, but only two protoypes were ever built before the Soviet Union ceased to exist and funding collapsed. The last of the <em>Kiev</em>s, the <em>Admiral Gorshkov</em>, was built with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Even More Dakka</a> than the first three ships, but has since been stripped of its "battlestar" status after being sold to India as the INS <em>Vikramaditya</em> and converted into a full-length aircraft carrier with only short-range defensive armament.
</li><li> In the case of both classes, the Soviets had sound technical, doctrinal, and political reasons for building them the way they did. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux_Convention_Regarding_the_Regime_of_the_Straits">The Montreux Convention, which governs transit of warships through the Bosporus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, allowed the transit of capital ships but sets restrictions on other types of ships, including aircraft carriers. As the largest Soviet shipyards, and the ones building the <em>Kiev</em> and <em>Kuznetsov</em> classes, were located on the Black Sea, the heavy anti-ship missiles allowed the Soviets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">call them capital ships</a> and transit them through the straits. This was necessary due to the doctrinal reasons: namely, that the ships were intended to provide air cover for the forces covering Soviet SSBN bastions from American attack, rather than the strike-oriented expeditionary role of American carriers. This also required them to operate in Arctic waters, hence the prior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. And finally, the Soviets were learning how to build carriers at all; carrying the missile armament they did still gave them some use if their aviation facilities failed.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Cold War, there were suggestions to convert the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa-class_battleship">Iowa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>-class battleships into hybrid battleship carriers like the <em>Ise</em> and <em>Hyuga</em> above; the conversion concept called for removal of the aft 16-inch turret and installing a ski jump and hangar facilities to support Harrier jump jets. Cost and practicality issues (among other things, the resulting ship would've been rather topheavy, to the point that capsizing in heavy seas would be a legitimate danger) meant that the concept never gained serious traction within the US Navy.
<ul><li> However they did have a blacktop capable of serving a limited number of VTOLs installed aft of the battery.
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of never built desighns, one plan by France was to convert the the nearly complete battle ship <em>Jean Bart</em> into a hybrid. Since this class of battleship featured all the guns at the front, she would have had a light carriers worth of aircraft and been able to keep all her big guns. Ultimatly she was completed as a battleship post war.
</li><li> Another never finished project was Nazi Germany's <em>Graf Zeppelin.</em> Like other World War II German surface ships, all their carrier designs were focused on hunting merchant ships. For some reason though, it was thought that carrier <em>itself</em> should engage merchant vessels and keep the bulk of it's airwing spotting and ready to attack any warships that might intervene. As a result, <em>Graf Zeppelin</em> would have had a pretty substantial array of guns if completed.
</li><li> The British <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible-class_aircraft_carrier">Invincible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>-class aircraft carriers were called "Through-Deck Cruisers" and equipped with the Sea Dart SAM system in order to sell the ships to a Parliament that had just recently forced retirement of the Royal Navy's last conventional carriers. Ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a>, as the development of the Sea Harrier gave the ships fixed-wing capability, and the Sea Dart system was eventually removed in favor of a CIWS gun.
</li><li> Much like seaplanes in World War II, most warships today carry, in addition to their gun and missile systems, at least one helicopter. Many classes took this a step further, ships like the Japanese <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirane-class_destroyer">Shirane<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> class or Soviet <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moskva-class_helicopter_carrier">Moskva<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> class dedicating a good half the ship to helicopter facilities aft, in addition to respectable missile armament forward. In most cases, these vessels are heavily focused on ASW, which helicopters are very good at.
</li><li> Most modern carriers have at least a few "dual-purpose" missiles among their anti-air armament. These anti-air missiles can also track and hit small watercraft and function as part of the ships point-defense system.
