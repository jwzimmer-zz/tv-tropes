</p><p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>
</p><p>The villain simply decides to kill <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">everyone</a></em>, including the hero. Sure, it's more bloodshed than planned, but at least the villain's point is made.
</p><p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>
</p><p>The ploy ends up distracting the villain, allowing the hero to get the upper hand or escape.
</p><p>Variations on (and parodies of) this theme have led to it becoming a trope of its own: someone else claims to be The Hero to protect the real one. There's also sometimes the inspiring subtext that "we are <em>all</em> The Hero; kill one and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsOneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsOneMan">the rest still stand</a>."

<ul><li> Parodied in a Coca-Cola ad. A teacher asks his class who emptied a Coke dispenser. One student slowly stands up and says: "I did it." After that, another student also stands up and says: <em>He</em> did it. Guess what the others do next.
</li><li> Not to be outdone, a Pepsi commercial took the "I'm Spartacus" scene from <em>Spartacus</em>, but replaced the beginning with a bit where a Roman soldier finds Spartacus's bag lunch and asks who it belongs to. Because it includes a Pepsi, everyone starts claiming it's theirs. The soldier then decides that <em>he</em> is Spartacus and drinks the Pepsi.
</li><li> A Southwest Airlines advertisement also had a humorous take on the trope. In Medieval Europe, a defeated army lays down its arms. Then the general of the victorious army says "Who amongst you goes by the name "Fenwick?" Tell me, and the rest of you will be spared." Before Fenwick surrenders himself, a warrior claims to be him. And then, much like the famous scene in <em>Spartacus</em>, the entire army one by one says "I am Fenwick!" But unlike <em>Spartacus</em>, one soldier screws it up by approaching the real Fenwick and asking him a stupid question, revealing him to the other army. He thinks he misplaced his shield because the one he is carrying has vertical stripes and the one he owns has horizontal stripes (most likely, it was his shield the whole time, rotated 90 degrees). The commercial's narrator then says "Wanna get away?", revealing that it's part of Southwest Airline's "Wanna get away?" advertising campaign, which is known for characters making embarrassing mistakes and needing to "get away".

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> the Brittanians announce that they intend to exile Zero, who wants to create a new area for the Japanese to live in. So he says he'll go along with it, but during the meeting he gets them to say that Zero's real identity isn't important and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">anyone who shares his ideals</a> is "Zero". Then, during the ceremony, after the announcement a cloud of smoke is released and when it clears, <em>everyone</em>—including a DOG—is wearing a Zero costume! And then a ship made out of an iceberg comes in to escort them! Reluctantly, the Brittanians allow them all to leave (primarily because the alternative would have been starting a massacre).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> manga, Mello demands to know the identity of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the one acting as L</span> so that he can kill him if the trade for the notebook goes south, threatening to kill the hostage if they don't comply. Matsuda saves Light and his dad from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">that dilemma</a> by hijacking the keyboard and telling Mello that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the one acting as L</span>.
</li><li> At the climax of season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ryugamine</span> outplays the people who come after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fake Celty</span> by using his position as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leader of the Dollars to gather a massive crowd of Dollars at that spot and stop his pursuers in their tracks.</span> Up until this point in the anime, people that weren't important to the plot were literally faceless and gray. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ryugamine</span> sent the message to everyone, the sea of gray suddenly became colored.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor">Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor</a></em>, when Yumiko is put on trial for tampering with Maya's pilot data, most of the main cast confess to the crime... with the final confessor being the human computer that controls the entire island - and has data to prove that <strong>all</strong> the confessions are true. Everyone has a reasonable explaination for why they supposedly did it. Soushi wanted her off the roster because he was afraid her pluckiness would cause problems, Sakura wanted to remove a rival for top pilot, Mamoru was just screwing around in the lab and accidentally changed the data, Kenji changed the data because he made a mistake trying to change his own data to get out of piloting, Kazuki didn't want her to fight, Mizoguchi was trying to look up her measurements on the computer and accidentally messed with the data etc.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, a group of villains comes to Fairy Tail's doorstep demanding Lucy. She's willing to turn herself over since she can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">just as easily fight back</a>, but her cousin Michelle offers herself as Lucy instead. Soon all the girls in Fairy Tail start calling themselves Lucy to disorient the villains; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Elfman</a> joins in. It's all for naught in the end, though, since the villains are not there for Lucy herself, but rather the part to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> in her possession.
</li><li> A villainous example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>. Over a dozen people attempted in some way to try and assassinate the Chairman, all of them claiming (and legitimately believing) to be The Laughing Man. It's later explained that they were all copycats inspired by a threat from the <em>real</em> Laughing Man.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>: The Yomi assassin "Spark" tries to destroy the Shinpaku HQ and demands to fight Kenichi. Since he's not there, several other members claim to be Kenichi, presumably to buy him time. Spark is not fooled.
</li><li> A variant shows up in the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyouranKazokuNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyouranKazokuNikki">Kyouran Kazoku Nikki</a></em>, when Kyouka is threatening Ouka to kill her since she's the true child of Enka, the rest of the family stands up and declares that they are, establishing their family bonds. Even Chika tries to get in on it, even though it was known from the start that she really isn't.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in an early chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em>. Shogun Yoshimune stumbles over her new robes during her first formal inspection of her new harem and hears laughter from the lines of men kneeling with their faces on the floor. When she demands to know who found her clumsiness so funny a young man in a comparatively simple outfit (falsely) confesses, which so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">impresses</a> Yoshimune that she selects him to be her first bedmate from the harem... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> thus unknowingly sentencing him to be executed</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedTrope">Implied</a> to have occurred in Episode 35 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon Journeys</a></em>. Team Rocket captures a herd of Pikachu including Ash's Pikachu, but they can't tell them apart.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Meowth:</strong> If you're the brat's Pikachu, please respond! <br/><strong>All the Pikachus</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">Pi-Pikachu</a>! <br/><strong>Meowth:</strong> DON'T LIE TO ME!
</div></li><li> Awesomely subverted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ressentiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ressentiment">Ressentiment</a></em>. Halfway through the series we're introduced to the <em>Big Bad</em> Ehara — an MMO player who has assembled a huge military guild and is using it to threaten both the game and the real world. All members of the guild are required to have avatars identical to his. In the final chapter it's revealed that Ehara is a monkey in a zoo who inexplicably has internet access in his cage and who has copied the face and name of the guy who usually brings him food.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito">Space Pirate Mito</a></em> combines this with : when the Galactic Patrol demands that Aoi, currently at school, give himself up. His classmates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInACrowd">don Aoi masks and rush out of the building</a>. Most of them end up captured, but they were able to buy Aoi the time he needed to get away.
</li><li> A variation occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> manga. Honda/Tristan wants to tell a girl in his class that he loves her, but he's too shy to do it himself. So he gets a blank jigsaw puzzle and gets Yugi to write the message for him.

Not liking his assigned seat, he switches with someone else. Unfortunately, the plane is overbooked, so the flight attendant has to go and ask people to give up their seats, starting with holders of free tickets.

<ul><li> It's kicked off by a story in which Rabbi Shimon Ben Gamliel brought together seven judges to declare a leap year but eight showed up and he demanded to know which one wasn't invited. This one isn't an example because one person simply took the fall for the real culprit, but it's followed by two examples.
</li><li> Rebbe was teaching and smelled garlic. He hated the smell of garlic (and everybody knew it, so there were no excuses), so he announced "Whoever ate garlic, leave." Rabbi Chiyya got up and left, but he was Rebbe's prized student and was obviously not the culprit - so one by one everyone else got up and left too, to save the real one from embarrassment.
</li><li> A woman came to the school run by Rabbi Meir, and stated that she had had relations (of a type equivalent to a binding marriage contract) with one of the students but didn't know which one. Rabbi Meir himself wrote her a bill of divorce, followed by every single one of his students, thus ensuring the divorce took place without embarrassing the student in question.

Soon, their eldest brother comes to town to do exactly the same... and the younger brother (who didn't know his siblings were taking up the blame for the "crime") returns to the courtroom and says that <em>he</em> was the killer, so his siblings must be released. The judge decides to leave it to God's judgement and makes the siblings plant three lime trees by their crowns, thinking that the one that withers sooner will signal who is the true culprit... so when <em>none</em> of the trees wither and dry, but start growing healthy and normal, the three brothers are released.

Garrison shows up and tells them they <em>all</em> had lice, and everyone gives Kenny a sock bath anyway. (After all, he really <em>did</em> lie about having lice.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> in "Bass to Mouth". One kid craps his pants in school, and is so humiliated he tries to kill himself. Since Cartman is usually the one who leads the bullying, the teachers instead hire him to prevent it. His initial response is to slip a different girl laxatives so that she craps herself and takes the humiliation off the first kid. When he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">finally understands</a> that <em>no</em> kid is supposed to be so embarrassed that they attempt suicide, his plan is to get everyone in school to crap their pants, because then nobody will be able to make fun of anybody else.

When the realtor gets to Squidward's house, Spongebob jokes about what a dump Squidward's house is and shows her Squidward's gallery room, when Patrick pops out from behind one of Squidward's paintings:
<div class="indent"><strong>Realtor</strong>: Oh, my, this painting is very nice. <br/><strong>Patrick</strong>: Thank you! <br/><strong>Realtor</strong>: Who is that? <br/><strong>Spongebob</strong> [<em>impersonating Squidward</em>]: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward. <br/><strong>Realtor</strong> [<em>skeptically surprised</em>]: You're <em>both</em> Squidward? <br/><strong>Spongebob</strong>: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward... <br/><strong>Spongebob</strong>, <strong>Patrick</strong>: We're both Squidward!
</div><ul><li> Later on, after the real Squidward has finished fixing up Spongebob's house and meets the realtor:
<div class="indent"><strong>Squidward</strong>: Stop! Get away from her! Ooh, ooh, I'm so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">BARNACLEHEADS</a> haven't harmed you in any way. <br/><strong>Realtor</strong> [<em>confused</em>]: Who are you? <br/><strong>Squidward</strong>: Why, I'm Squidward. <br/><strong>Realtor</strong> [<em>pointing at Patrick, Spongebob, and Squidward in turn</em>]: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndImtheQueenOfSheba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndImtheQueenOfSheba">What kind of fool do you take me for?</a> He's Squidward, <em>he's</em> Squidward, <em>you're</em> Squidward? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">''I'm'' Squidward!</a> Are there any other Squidwards I should know about? <br/><strong>Gary</strong> [<em>with a pickle for a nose enters the room</em>]: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">Meow.</a>

Later, during a debate championship Fred's sister was a part of, she admits to also being dead and several other people did the same. Some guy claimed to be Spartacus and got stared for that.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em>: Gimpy sets up a string of pranks against his tyrannical RA, under the guise of G-Prime. When his RA threatens punishment on the entire dorm unless the real G-Prime confesses, the trope is played out. The subversion comes when Gimpy doesn't understand that they were doing it as an act of solidarity, and assumes they are trying to steal the credit and glory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">One student even claims to be Spartacus.</a>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A variation of this happened on a flight when the crew ejected a blind passenger because his guide-dog wouldn't fit under the seat ahead of him. All the passengers walked off the plane in solidarity with the blind passenger. <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/flight-canceled-after-passengers-protest-ejection-of-bl-1464504554">The airline cancelled the flight and chartered buses to drive all the passengers to the destination<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Occurred in Vietnam in the case of a legendary US Marine sniper named Carlos Hathcock, who had a trademark in the form of a white feather he wore in his bush cap. The Vietcong hated him so much, they eventually started sending entire squads just to hunt him down. Knowing the devastating effect losing Hathcock would have on morale, marines in the area took to wearing white feathers of their own to deceive the enemy soldiers.
</li><li> In the (possibly apocryphal, but usually treated as fact) story of Jackie Robinson, the first black player in the Major League, his Dodgers teammates responded to threats on Robinson's life during a game by all wearing his jersey — number 42, which has since been retired out of respect. Whether this story is true or not, one day out of the year, every player on every team wears 42 in tribute to Robinson.
</li><li> There's an apocryphal, but widely believed I Am Spartacus from World War II. In Nazi Germany and its occupied areas, Jews were forced to wear gold stars for identification. The story has it that when the Nazis attempted to impose this measure on occupied Denmark, King Christian X began to wear a gold star in solidarity with his nation's Jews, and so many Danes began following his example that it became impossible to tell the Jews apart. While this isn't true in fact, it's true in spirit—there was a widespread movement among ordinary Danes to defend the Jews, and for the first few years of occupation, the Danish government refused to impose or enforce any discriminatory measure against the Jews. When the Nazis decided to get tougher, the Danes were so successful at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews">hiding and evacuating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> them that of around 8,000 Danish Jews, the Nazis only managed to capture about 450, of whom 400 were eventually rescued.
<ul><li> It's said that when some Nazis asked a mayor and a priest on the Greek island Zakynthos to turn over a list of all the Jews there, they turned in a list bearing only their own names.
</li><li> When Allied soldiers were captured by Nazis, Jewish servicemen would be taken from the group and sent to death or slave labor camps. However, when a commandant ordered Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds to gather the Jews from his group of POWs, Edmonds ordered all his men to come out. He refused to back down even when the commandant threatened to shoot him, and eventually became the first U.S. serviceman awarded Righteous Among the Nations status.
</li></ul></li><li> When Prince Harry announced his intention to serve in Iraq, there was understandable concern about him making his unit a prime target. In response to this, many soldiers started wearing T shirts that said 'I'm Harry".
</li><li> The Trope Namer is very often parodied at motorbike rallies, generally after dark. Depending on the general mood at the time (and exactly <em>how</em> late it is), the initial "I'm Spartacus!" can be met with various obscenities, or enthusiastically taken up, generally morphing into "I'm Spartacus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">and so is my wife!"</a>, and even "I'm Spartacus' wife!"
</li><li> In the military, it's not unusual for everyone in a unit to do this if someone is going to get in trouble for a minor infraction, in order to protect their buddy. Conversely, everyone knows who did it, but no one says anything when the Captain Rough or Sergeant Smooth demands to know that person's name. It for this reason that the US Armed Forces, as well as most others, have outlawed mass punishment (you can't punish the whole unit for one person's mistake). Please note that this does <em>not</em> hold true in all militaries, particularly those in non-democratic countries.
</li><li> There is a Medieval subversion. When the French king invaded Italy he met an Italian prince, and both had Swiss mercenaries. As it was not considered appropriate for Swiss to slay Swiss, the "Italian" army gave way and the prince was smuggled away dressed as a soldier. The French general found what they were up to and paraded them offering gold to whoever would reveal "who was Spartacus". At first none of them revealed who it was, but finally one tattle-tale stepped forward and revealed the prince. This man, whose greed apparently was greater then his wits, later returned home to Switzerland where he was executed by the government for bringing disgrace on his comrades. You can read more about it <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_of_Novara">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Eric Douglas, son of Kirk (star of "Spartacus") Douglas, tried his hand at stand up. It did not go particularly well, and he was being heckled rather nastily. Finally he snapped and shouted at the heckler "You can't heckle me! I am Kirk Douglas' son!". The heckler got to his feet, and shouted back "No! I am Kirk Douglas' son!" Pretty soon the whole audience is on its feet joining in.
</li><li> Escort ships (the naval kind, not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a> kind) often carry blip enhancers so that on radar they appear to be the ship they're escorting. In practical terms, that means that enemy ships that are aiming by radar will shoot at them instead of the ship they're protecting.
</li><li> On a flight to Canada, two members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> almost simultaneously stood up and shouted "I'm passenger Johnson" in response to a request to see said passenger. This started a chain reaction. Then they arrived and rode the luggage carousel. The flight crew was glad to see them leave.
</li><li> During an incident in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishSovietWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishSovietWar">Polish-Soviet War</a> some Polish prisoners all stripped to their undershorts so that the Russians couldn't tell officers from enlisted.
</li><li> In one subversion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> had just won a clan war in which a horse had been shot out from under him. Ghenghis lined up the captives and asked "Which one of you shot my horse?" One man boldly said "I did." Then Genghis <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">rewarded</a></em> him. To elaborate, Khan was raised in a world of unending cycles of revenge. His revolution in part consisted of uniting the Mongol people by having a genius for finding people of talent, putting them in high position, and making them loyal to the Khan and law rather than their clan. Conquered clans were embraced into the fold, the men divided and dispersed into multi-clan bands, and the whole lot loyal to the Khan and the idea of a unified people. Soon afterwards, the world learned to be <em>terrified</em> of a people who, one generation earlier, had considered a coat of animal furs to be a sign of great wealth.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Joke_Trial">Twitter joke trial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. After a guy was arrested for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">posting a joke about blowing up an airport</a> on Twitter, thousands of people reposted the joke verbatim with the hashtag #iamspartacus.
</li><li> Comedian Lee Evans once did a brilliant joke about just saying "I am Spartacus" in response to every question asked by the people on those annoying phone calls you get when people try to sell you shit you don't want or need.
</li><li> This is why privacy advocates encourage everyone to use encryption whenever possible. If only a few people use it, crypto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">draws unwanted attention</a> from the authorities.
</li><li> British author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> recounted being at a convention after having read a newspaper article that claimed his entire readership was pimply, fourteen-year-old boys named Kevin. When he told his audience, several members re-enacted the <em>Life of Brian</em> scene all the way to "I'm Kevin, and so's my wife!"
</li><li> A bit of a variation in the sense that the "Spartacus" was never even there: At the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> convention Canterlot Gardens, one panel was for brony musicians. Before the con started, every musician apparently agreed to introduce themselves as Alex S (a brony musician who couldn't make it to the con). Cue the first words spoken to be "Welcome to the brony musician panel; we are all Alex S" and everyone jumping in to agree, saying things like "And I'm Alex S" or "Are you sure? Because I'm pretty sure <em>I'm</em> Alex S".

After one student reveals that they actually <em>are</em> Methodist and gets kicked out of the class, all the other students start claiming to be Methodists, too.
<div class="indent"> Soon, the entire class is in the hall, and only the teacher is left in the room.
</div></li><li> Following the controversial shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, some protesters took to the streets to defend Officer Wilson. Many of Wilson's fellow officers also did this, but also covered their badges, resulting in even more controversy. When asked for their identities, the officers would only say, "I am Darren Wilson."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekazHimaruya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekazHimaruya">Hidekaz Himaruya</a> used this trope to show his face and still keep it secret on Comiket 2014, by having several staff members claim that they too were Himaruya.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses">Satanic Verses</a></em> fatwa called for the death of all publishers along with the author. The German translations has two pages of publishers, more than two hundred individuals and some eighty publishing houses.
</li><li> During the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, there were reports that police were using social media to find out who was going to show up. Over one million people responded by doing a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/01/500268879/more-than-a-million-check-in-on-facebook-to-support-the-standing-rock-sioux">virtual check-in<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Even though police said they were not looking at who "checks in," it is nevertheless a show of solidarity.
</li><li> When police in Durham, North Carolina attempted to arrest protestors who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToppledStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToppledStatue">tore down a Confederate memorial</a>, over <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167689007.html">100 people showed up at the station<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to turn themselves in.
</li><li> When trolls threatened to out the creator of the "S**tty Men in Media" List, an anonymous, private list of men in Hollywood who women might need to watch out for (whether it's stealing work, just being unpleasant, or sexual misconduct), several women <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/twitter-protects-media-men-harpers_us_5a56a2f5e4b08a1f624b382b">immediately took to Twitter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to confess that they created it so that if the original creator did get outed, you'd never know who it was.
</li><li> The 2008 Drum Corps International Champions — Phantom Regiment — did a "Spartacus" show. Close to the end, one of the drum majors shouted "I am Spartacus," and was followed by the color guard...and then by the entire stadium crowd, as seen at <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDd5Pu_TVNk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDd5Pu_TVNk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> . Possibly the greatest audience participation in drum corps history.
</li><li> Not long after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, General Dwight Eisenhower issued an order to dismiss any women serving in the WAC who were found to be lesbian. That is, until Sergeant Johnnie Phelps begged to differ<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9dj6p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9dj6p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9dj6p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In an interview later in life, Phelps said that, "There were almost nine hundred women in the battalion. I could honestly say that 95 percent of them were lesbians".</span>:
<div class="indent"><strong>General Dwight Eisenhower:</strong> "It's come to my attention that there are lesbians in the WACs, we need to ferret them out...."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sergeant Johnnie Phelps:</strong> "If the General pleases, sir, I'll be happy to do that, but the first name on the list will be mine."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Eisenhower's secretary:</strong> "If the General pleases, sir, my name will be first and hers will be second."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Phelps:</strong> "Sir, you're right, there are lesbians in the WACs  and if you want to replace all the file clerks, section commanders, drivers, every woman in the WAC detachment, I will be happy to make that list. But you must know, sir, that they are the most decorated group  there have been no illegal pregnancies, no AWOLs, no charges of misconduct."
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Eisenhower:</strong> "Forget the order".
