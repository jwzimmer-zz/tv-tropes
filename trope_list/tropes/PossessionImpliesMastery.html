</p><p>Also, a character who is explicitly responsible for repair and maintenance of a piece of technology as well as operating it is likely to understand the underlying physics of its operations in great detail: The chief engineer of a nuclear-powered submarine probably <em>could</em> design a nuclear reactor, or at least explain the physics to a physicist from the early 1930s well enough to get the ball rolling on a prototype.

<ul><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. Most exorcists only have a basic knowledge of innocence and their learn more about it through battles. Allen didn't even know what innocence is before joining the order and needed Komui to explain it to him. Conversely the scientists of the Black Order study it and have a deep knowledge of its mechanics even though there us still a lot to be discovered.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Conspicuous by its absence</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, where barely understood higher technology acts like it. Multiple plot points involve the protagonists being forced to use a foolhardy technique or maneuver and having it blow up in their faces. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> first takes off using alien antigravity generators, which proceed to tear through the hull and float off into the sky. The second attempt is done with ordinary engines. On the other hand, the crew then pulled off an extreme low altitude space fold jump to outmaneuver the Zentraedi, leaving the aliens astonished that their enemy could do something they thought impossible. The inexperienced and desperate <em>Macross</em> crew simply did not know that themselves and succeeded by pure luck.</span> This actually works somewhat in their favor since their enemies are kept continually off guard with each stunt, unable to decide if their completely unpredictable enemies are pathetic amateurs or half-crazed tactical geniuses.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the Zentraedi could operate all their technology — but when something broke (such as the big screen in Breetai's command deck), all they could do was clean up the mess and make do without because they were kept deliberately ignorant of how to create or repair their own technology.
</li><li> This lack of understanding actually kicked off the plot. The crew of the <em>Macross</em> found out too late that the original owners of their ship had rigged it to fire its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">main cannon</a> on the first Zentraedi ship that came in range, thus throwing humanity into a war with the aliens. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> More to the point, the low altitude space fold jump mentioned above ended up bringing an <em>entire island</em> (with over 5000 civilians) along for the ride, out to around the orbit of Pluto (they had intended to jump behind the moon. WITHOUT the island, in case you were wondering). Better yet, the fold space generator that they had used to make the jump literally vanished into thin air during the maneuver.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is the power of the Gandalfr Familiar, the position held by Saito, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>. If it's made for battle, he can use it. This is demonstrated when a shiny display sword given to him by Kirche completely fails in battle.
</li><li> Haru Glory's Ten Commandments sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>. It has ten forms, and Haru seems to know exactly what every form does the moment he needs it, such as bringing out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Runesave</span> to save <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elie without having to kill her</span>. This is however justified since the Rave of Knowledge explicitly provides this insight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, this is quite the opposite for pretty much anyone with spirit abilities. Especially captains, no matter how much of a genius they're stated to be. Which explains just why characters like Ichigo and Toushiro can keep getting pretty much curb-stomped, despite their power levels and genius. They have it — doesn't mean they have mastered it yet. Kubo seems to take great pleasure in avoiding this trope.
<ul><li> Kenpachi Zaraki is the best example of subverting this trope. He owns a Zanpakuto... but to him, it's just a normal sword. He makes up for the lack of Zanpakuto abilities with monstrous strength and spiritual pressure. Similarly, lesser shinigami have Zanpakuto without abilities, but it's implied that for most shinigami, gaining the abilities simply comes with time and effort, leading to an increase in rank and power.
</li><li> Potentially utilized in the latest arc <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a Vandenreich member has literally stolen a Bankai, and gloats on how he will kill his opponent with it. The ensuring attack is completely ineffective and he gets stomped in less than a second, and it's pointed out that the attack was much less powerful than it was under its original owner.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> seem to be able to pilot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Knightmare Frames</a>, despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">found themselves using them for the first time</a>. Somewhat justified in that Suzaku mentioned having had some military-mandatory training on simulators in the first episode, Lelouch having used the Ganymede to make giant pizzas during previous school festivals, and Kallen having assumedly had some time to practice with that old Glascow. Still, a line from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries">Abridged Series</a> is used as the page quote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a>...
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em>. The main protagonist (among others) are given special combat suits and weaponry, but they have literally no idea of how they work until they figure it out by trial-and-error.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Usually averted with the Devil Fruits (especially with Luffy), but not so much for Kaku and Kalifa. While being top-ranked assassins with all sorts of cool superpowers, they were given Devil Fruits to be even tougher. Only a few hours later do they appear having nearly complete mastery over their powers, with the exception of Kaku, who, while shifting forms, accidentally enters his animal form instead of his hybrid.
</li><li> Played straight with Usopp. He can operate or make wondrous inventions out of anything he can put his hands on, including a cannon (which he's never operated before), advanced fireworks, and the bizarre "Dials" of Skypiea (which he could never, ever, have seen or researched). His immediate understanding of any object in his possession would border on intuitive aptitude if he weren't so miserable at making repairs to the ship.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">magical girls</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IlSolePenetraLeIllusioni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IlSolePenetraLeIllusioni">Il Sole penetra le illusioni</a></em> seem to have an inherent understanding of how to use their powers. Which would help explain why they're not actually trained.
</li><li> At the beginning of the second season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a>, the heroines get new versions of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Dreamspinners</a>, which require way different manouvers than the first one<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05gf6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note05gf6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05gf6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for newbies: the first one made the dress and hat appear in mid-air and the witch haves to wear them before the musical cue it's playing ends, while gloves and boots magically appear: the second one instead still gives them a musical cue, but this time they have to clap the hands on it twice to make the gloves appear, then clap it on both feet to make the boots appear, two claps over the head to make the dress appear, wear the dress, and clap on the head twice to make the hat appear, with all the claps following the musical cue's tempo</span>, and they can easily do it without getting explanations on how to do it like it happened with the first one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> averts this trope in the case of Gilgamesh, who has a Noble Phantasm which amounts to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> containing the prototype versions of every legendary weapon in history. Despite this, he can't actually use any of them effectively, he never trained in swordsmanship as he was a king, not a warrior, so he resorts to firing them as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades">Storm of Blades</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shirou points this out in their final fight in the Unlimited Blade Works route as why Gilgamesh is just about the only Servant he could hope to defeat: Gilgamesh is so dependent on winning fights with barrages of swords that as soon as he fights someone who can do the same thing but even slightly faster, he's unable to match his opponent in close combat.</span>
</li><li> In the first episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Sun and Moon</em> anime, Ash is gifted a Z-Ring with the Electrium-Z Crystal by Guardian Deity Tapu Koko. In the second episode, Ash and Pikachu use a Z-Move with little apparent difficulty — though Tapu Koko does guide Ash in the motions necessary to activate the Z-Move, and the crystal shatters afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> during Mai's battle with Marik — she uses a card that lets her control Marik's god card The Winged Dragon of Ra, but because the card is written in an incomprehensible language she can't use it (but Marik can).
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">     Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Subverted mercilessly in Marvel Comics' <em>GLX-mas Special #1</em>, where the second Grasshopper is taking his first jumps in a brand-new super-suit. After foiling a villain, Grasshopper is approached with a dinner invitation by his unwitting sister. After denying her advances, he makes a heroic exit by engaging the suit's "Maximum Jump" ability, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which propels him into space, killing him instantly. Sidenote: to this day, there have been three Grasshoppers in Marvel continuity, and not one have them have survived more than a single issue. The most recent one debuted and was killed in all of three panels.</span>
</li><li> Played totally straight with the character Adept from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrikeforceMorituri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrikeforceMorituri">Strikeforce: Morituri</a></em>, whose superpower was the ability to analyze and understand anything she touched. Since their primary opponents were a race of alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">Planet Looters</a> with scavenged technology, this was <em>very</em> useful.
</li><li> Averted for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a> legacy. The first one, Dan Garett, got powers from it by saying a magic word (ultimately revealed to be misusing it, and the magic likely damaged its true function). Then Ted Kord came into possession of the scarab but never got it to work, instead borrowing its motif for his costume and gadgets. It was only the third owner, Jaime Reyes, who had it work as intended - but he still hasn't mastered it; the scarab activated because <em>it</em> chose to, and he still argues with it over what to do at times.

Kanji, the first person introduced as a user, never went beyond the first "complete" version of the jutsu as he was only interested in it's ability to turn women into sex slaves. Kanji's former village only have his incomplete notes and created a weaker version that makes people want to help the user (usually by giving them classified information). As a result, whenever something new happens with either the jutsu, Naruto, or one of his lovers, they have to spend time researching to figure out what changed.

However, they never developed any kind of science and have a cultural tunnel-vision centered around the technologies in the cache; not only are they unable to analyze or extrapolate base principles from the ancient knowledge, but they cannot imagine or cope with a technology not laid out in detail for them in the cache.
</li><li> The Yuuzhan Vong in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> consider it heresy to even consider attempting to devise new biotechnology.

The character in question proceeds to ask the heroes how much they actually know about the technology behind their own spaceships. (Hint: few people in real life actually know how to build a jet airplane, and even fewer in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a> universe know how to build a spaceship, especially a hyperdrive-capable one.)
</li><li> Invoked briefly in the <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> novelization: Anakin Skywalker manages to land an alien ship whose controls he's never seen before, which wasn't designed to be landed in an atmosphere, while half of the spacecraft is missing and the remaining half is on fire. Because he's just that good (or because the Plot is with him). Lampshaded in both the novel and the film when he comments that "Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant."

The limited AIs and the 'Net' that controls their society is copied into the new systems, and when long unused alarms go off people don't understand what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Incoming Artillery Strike</a></em> means.
</li><li> Played with by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MostlyHarmless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MostlyHarmless">Mostly Harmless</a></em>. Arthur Dent's only practical skill is making sandwiches, so when he crashes on a primitive alien world he can't offer any of humankind's knowledge and inventions ("He couldn't even make a toaster"). But the alien villagers still venerate him as 'The Sandwich Maker' since they hadn't thought of the idea.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> novels where Admiral Shannon Foraker is quite frank about how even when they capture Mantie technology they can't actually use it because they don't have the same tech base or miniaturisation technology, but that it's still worthwhile because it gives them ideas on how to do it, and how to develop countermeasures.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTommyknockers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTommyknockers">The Tommyknockers</a></em>. The eponymous entities have no clue HOW their stuff works, but somehow managed to figure out how to make it.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> as a whole. Just because you have a broomstick/wand/crystal ball/whatever doesn't mean you can <em>use</em> it without going to school first, except for the main character, who knows how to fly a broom well enough to make the Quidditch team without a full lesson. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>, it becomes a key plot point that merely wielding a certain wand is not enough to be its "true" master. However, there is no requisite knowledge the wielder might lack, just the requisite action of "defeating" the old master.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy">The Bartimaeus Trilogy</a></em>, where Nathaniel gains possession of an extremely powerful magical artifact and tries to use it against his enemy. Bartimaeus notes that there's no chance of him being able to master it on his first try, but stops when he succeeds in generating a massive surge of magical energy. Then he loses control and the backlash knocks him unconscious.
<ul><li> In the final book demons possessing people run into this problem, having very little idea how to actually work their new bodies. At one point the immensely powerful demon Nouda is seen being helped to his feet by a lesser demon who's had a body longer, after he fell over and started twitching.

<ul><li> This is the primary ability of Berserker. If he touches anything that could remotely be considered a weapon, he instantly is able to use it like a master. Worse, he corrupts it with his mana and powers it up so that it's more powerful than it would otherwise be. This works on everything from swords to clubs to gatling guns to <em>F-15 fighter jets</em>.
</li><li> Specifically averted with Archer, whose primary ability is that he owns all the treasures in the world, including famous mythological weapons. He states himself that his wealth has long since exceeded his own knowledge and his primary fighting style is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades">shooting ancient, super-powerful weapons at his enemies.</a> It's implied that he couldn't just pick up any old sword in his treasury and use it to the same level of skill as its original owner, if very well at all.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gateway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gateway">Gateway</a></em> books involve a lot of this. The eponymous station contains many ships, each with an FTL drive and a navigation system that works by pushing a few buttons. Unfortunately, nobody quite knows how the ships work or how to navigate them. Humans explore the galaxy with them by pushing the buttons in different combination and seeing where the ships goes. Hope you brought enough supplies to survive the trip there and back(not that you know how long the trip is going to be). Some ships just don't come back.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Scott Adams</a> discusses this in relation to UFOs in his book, <em>The Dilbert Future</em>. He points out that "just because you see a person driving a car, that doesn't mean that they invented the automobile," so we can't assume that an alien piloting an advanced spaceship is a genius. He goes on to speculate that the aliens that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">abduct people</a> are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a>' equivalent of rednecks, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalProbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalProbing">Anal Probing</a> is their equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowTipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowTipping">Cow Tipping</a>.

Plus, there's the fact that all aliens have base-10 numeral systems, have the same emotional and intellectual range as humans, progress along the same basic technological path as humans, look like humans in rubber masks, and can even write documents word-for-word identical to the U.S. Constitution without ever having seen it.... With all those similarities, is it any wonder they all build similar technologies?
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero">The Greatest American Hero</a></em> received an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> suit at the start of the series, lost the instructions, and spent most of the series amusingly floundering about trying to figure out how to use it correctly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> tends to play with this trope fairly successfully on occasion. In one episode it's revealed that the SGC computers can't even interpret many of the Stargate's feedback signals, and others are disregarded on a routine basis in order to establish a connection. This is suggested to be a major contributing factor to the various mishaps of one type or another that have occurred when using the gate. Another episode introduces the Air Force's prototype hybrid fighter craft, combining standard Earth technology with that of Go'auld Gliders - which promptly goes wrong due to incomplete understanding of the alien technology incorporated in the design.
<ul><li> This is also true of the Goa'uld themselves, who mostly just use stolen technology without really understanding it. There are a few Goa'uld who genuinely are good at understanding science and technology (such as the System Lord Baal and a lesser Goa'uld who served Cronus), but they are decidedly in the minority.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, this is pretty much the standard. Hand five people giant robots, watch them pilot them effortlessly, including the part where they merge into one giant robot, although many series with robotic zords have the combination process mostly automated and those with living zords simply ask them to do it for them (basically).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>; the three starting Rangers had been Rangers for a while when we first saw them suited, and Dillon's enhanced abilities made him a fast learner and a superb fighter from day one. Ziggy, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a>, is <em>hilarious</em> as we watch him try to get the hang of his gear.

It's subverted in the second episode, as Ryuuonosuke knows <em>about</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Samurai Gattai</a> but doesn't actually know what it does or how its done and winds up getting everyone to stack themselves up in a totem pole like formation.

The Rangers have to refer to the instruction manuals of their Formula Nova and Ranger Vehicles <em>in mid-battle</em> to figure them out. This has proven flawed at least once, when a copy of the manual once fell into a fire in the middle of a battle.

The Doctor cannot understand why the Cybermen would do something so catastrophic, since it would be just as damaging for them as for everyone else; it falls to another character to point out that the Cybermen's timeship is <em>stolen</em>, not built, and that they do not understand its principles.
<ul><li> Averted in the first few years of <em>Doctor Who</em> with the TARDIS (if by first few years, you mean the first 20 seasons or so). Part of Sydney Newman's original character brief was that he did not know how to steer his stolen timeship; however, in execution, it was a combination of "the Doctor didn't know how" and "the ship was already old"—this is why the Chameleon Circuit broke down in 1963 England. The TARDIS is also fully sentient and aware in eleven dimensions, so it always sends him where he needs to go instead of where he wants to go. The characteristic flight sound has also been revealed to be because he leaves the brake on.
</li><li> It's further revealed (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and demonstrated, in <em>Journey's End</em></span>) that a TARDIS is designed to be piloted by several Time Lords at once. The Doctor, piloting alone, consequently has trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> series sometimes have a character just <em>know</em> how to use their Rider powers within seconds of obtaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a> - including how to use the Trinket in the first place. This depends on the series, there are subversions and some series play this straight.
<ul><li> The original Kamen Rider did not know anything about his powers, due to them being forced on him and then the inventor of said powers passing away in the first episode. Numerous episodes show him trying to figure out what he is.
</li><li> Kamen Rider 2 seems to play this straight, until it's revealed that he has had some kind of training in his powers by the bad guys before defecting to the good side.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Kuuga did not know anything about his powers or transformation trinket, but received a telepathic "last will" that gave him hints.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Agito has no idea what he's doing with his powers, actually going on some kind of autopilot due to amnesia and doesn't even remember what he's supposed to be doing with his powers.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Ryuki has no idea what his deck of cards does or why monsters are suddenly attacking him. He has to be shown what they do, as they were intended for someone else.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Faiz plays this straight, actually taking the transformation trinket from someone who can't use it; and then using it perfectly his first time. However he still requires help to use the extra powers.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Fourze had no idea how to transform, and is viewed as a complete idiot for grabbing his transformation trinket from someone who DID know how to use it. (But could not) Every episode is a subversion as the sheer number of powers Fourze gets all require either explanation, testing, or just dumb luck.
</li><li> Kamen Rider W is a subversion and playing it straight all at once. Phillip, half of W, knows exactly how the powers work. Shotaro actually doesn't and lucked into being the other half of W.
</li><li> Kamen Rider OOO is given his trinket and told how to use it by a centuries old monster.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Gaim has absolutely no idea what he's doing when he first transforms out of instinct, and has to be shown how to operate his weapons by a mysterious woman in white.
</li><li> Kamen Rider Drive once again has no idea what his powers are as they are still being developed during the show. Fortunately his trinket itself knows what it's own powers are, and it talks back.
</li></ul></li><li> Explicitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, where when you get a new alien technology you either have the original builders helping you or the initial efforts at using it are less than satisfactory (as shown when a Human fiddled with some devices from Ikarra and became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> hellbent on killing anyone who wasn't a pure Ikarran, with parameters decided by fanatics, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Excalibur</a></em>, who has some troubles any time she fires her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>). In fact the three groups known for being technology scavengers (Earth Alliance, Centauri Republic and Narn Regime) have the rather pragmatic approach to disassemble what they find, analyze and experiment on it in a safe location until they have a good understanding of what it does and how it works, and then build their own version.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation">Alien Nation</a></em>. The Newcomers were all slaves, who obviously weren't allowed any knowledge of how the Overseer ship that brought them to Earth worked. As one of the Newcomer characters noted, one wouldn't expect all of the passengers of a 747 to know how to build and fly the plane amongst themselves. The disconnect between what the Newcomers actually know and what the civilization that built the ship is capable of fuels much of the social tension between humans and Newcomers in the series.
</li><li> Played straight with Clifford DeVoe (AKA the Thinker) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em>, which is justified by his extreme intelligence. After taking the powers of metahumans, he's instantly able to use them much more efficiently and in creative ways than their original owners. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his usage of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a>'s powers borders on full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a></span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> up to 3rd edition averts this, as you need an (expensive) Identify spell, a good skill check or some creative experimentation to understand what a magic item does and how to activate it. Capturing magical items in (A)D&amp;D used to be only half the battle, getting them to work was even more 'fun'. This was lampshaded by the 'magical items' in <em>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</em>... which used flowcharts very similar to those from Gamma World as the hapless PCs tried to figure out advanced technology.
<ul><li> 4th edition plays it straight: any adventurer who spends five minutes studying a magic item will automatically know everything useful about it. It's the same in 5th edition, except the duration is increased to an hour.
</li><li> Weapons were first just allowed by class lists, but obvious issues led to simple solution in AD&amp;D — penalties for non-proficient use. A character can grab any weapon, but this won't do much good without a proficiency in it, which for a non-warrior class may or may not be learnable at all. Fourth edition reversed it: anyone can use any weapon at its base stats, but if you're proficient you get a <em>bonus</em> to it, and certain abilities require certain equipment (two melee weapons, a ranged weapon, the right class' implement, etc.) to even be used.
</li><li> In third edition, you could get the "Skillful Enchantment" on any weapons. After being so enchanted, anyone can pick up the weapon and use it at least as well as they can their normal weapons or better in the case of character classes that least emphasized combat (so it eliminates the non-proficiency penalty and sets your attack bonus up to the middle progression if it wasn't already at that level.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> has similar, highly amusing tables for meddling with stuff you don't understand. Including modifiers for poking it with a stick.
</li><li> The Imperium of Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are pretty much the same. More than a fair proportion of their military equipment relies on technology long since lost. Tech-Priests pray to the machines to convince them to fix themselves, while doing rituals they believe appease the machine spirit rather than realizing they're the ones fixing it.
<ul><li> The Orks would seem like a straight play of the trope, as the "Mekboyz" know tech on a genetic level, including captured enemy hardware. Looking deeper, all Ork tech runs on the psychic gestalt generated by Ork belief in the fact that the tech will work, to the point where a human opening up an Ork gun may find simply a load of junk parts in a shoddy casing. Looted vehicles also have a chance of catastrophic failure... although to be fair, this is true of even scratch-built vehicles.
</li></ul></li><li> This is an unfortunate fact of life for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> card game players; duelists looking for a quick and cheap (figuratively, though <em>definitely</em> not literally) victory will "netdeck", or go online and copy a tournament-winning deck card-for-card. The theory is that playing a tourney-winning card will give them the ability to win more, and assuming they'll be able to pull off all of the best combos and strategies associated with that deck as the original player has. This should not work in reality, but somehow it <em>does</em>, because within the (relatively) simple ruleset of the game, the idea of being able to reverse engineer the winning strategy for <em>using</em> the deck just from looking at its parts makes a bit more sense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, don't expect to win a large tournament by just netdecking, looking up a deck that's currently dominant, and showing up with it. Having a good deck doesn't necessarily mean you know how to use it. Control decks require precise timing and an exact knowledge of where to spend your limited answers, combo decks require that you know how every card in your deck interacts to generate the winning combos, and aggro decks require that you know when to attack, when to hold back, and when to block - all of which requires knowledge of the constantly evolving metagame. If the deck is so strong, you're going to run into other people playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">the same deck</a>, but who know what to do with it. In addition by the time you get to a tournament, really good players will have analyzed the famous "winning deck", noted its vulnerabilities, and may have modified their own decks to include counters or even built new decks specifically designed to beat it.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, where players are often ordered to test out new experimental equipment in the field, and report back on the results. Unfortunately, because the equipment is always well above their security clearance level, they cannot be told how it works, or even how to operate it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> Explicitly a rule in The Hero System. If you purchase an item (or special ability) with character points, you are automatically assumed to know how to use it. If you do not use character points (for example in a fantasy game, buying a sword with gold pieces) you need a requisite weapon familiarity skill.
</li><li> In the text RPG <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a>, a PC can use any weapon they have without a Weapon Proficiency (WP) in that type of weapon with no disadvantages. But when a player does take a WP in a weapon type, they get bonuses. However, a player can't pilot some of the more 'fun' vehicles without a Piloting Skill in say... Giant Robot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a> does away with the d20 proficiency rules, and assumes that characters are proficient with their weapons, equipment, and powers to the extent of their bonuses when using them. Of course, there are optional rules in "Mastermind's Manual" (akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">D&amp;D's</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.d20srd.org/index.htm">"Unearthed Arcana"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to cram proficiencies back into the system for those who like to make the needlessly complex again.
</li><li> Some games play it straight to streamline certain assumptions, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities">Prose Descriptive Qualities</a></em> system games like <em>Dead Inside</em> or <em>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</em>. Any Quality or Forte is assumed to have a "penumbra" of related knowledge reflecting broad experience with the subject at hand. In other words, if ownership of a car is important enough to your character that you've noted it down on your character sheet, then you probably do know how to fix it up or break it down. The idea is to let characters be fairly competent and able to maintain their skills and gear without having to go into the minutiae of whether they know how to do so.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. Anyone who's trained as a mechwarrior can climb into the cockpit of pretty much any mech they'd like and use it without issue as soon as they get the neurohelmet tuned and the command couch adjusted. There are numerous examples of mechwarriors stealing a mech that's radically different from the one they normally handle and instantly be able to pilot it without complication. Somewhat justified in that Mechs are built with the same controls and the neurohelmet has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsUpDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsUpDisplay">Heads-Up Display</a>, and readouts on the Mech itself may be in different places depending on the manufacturer but generally are going to display the same information, meaning the most the pilot has to adjust to is the class of the Mech and the weapons layout.

</li><li> Whenever Dante of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> acquires a new weapon, he instantly has intimate knowledge of how it works, no matter its complexity or peculiarity, to the point where he can use the weapon <em>far</em> more competently than it was even intended to be within <em>seconds</em> of acquiring it. In the first game, it was implied that this was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">the weapons were sentient</a> and were guiding his actions, or communicating to him. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>, Dante's character profile states that this is actually one of his specified superpowers—he can use ANY weapon, <em>period</em>, the moment he touches it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em>, if your infantry squads can pick it up, they can reload and handle it like the original owners. Even if the weapon was comparatively rare on the enemy faction.
</li><li> After playing through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, one gets the idea that while Wander can shoot a bow well and ride his horse like a pro, he swings a sword like he has no idea what he's doing with it. Makes sense, since he's supposed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have stolen the sword</span>. Maybe.
</li><li> It's a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>: the peoples of the galaxy have access to Mass Relay technology, and are able to use it quite effectively, but have no real understanding of it (or rather, they understand how Mass Relay technology works, but can't replicate it).
<ul><li> Shepard, having the collective experience of the Prothean race in their mind, becomes a minor plot point in the first and third game. Due to this Cypher, all Prothean technology reacts to their presence as though they were a Prothean; allowing them to see Prothean data where others would see only static, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fully activate the Prothean beacon on Thessia</span>, which has defied comprehension by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Asari</span> for millennia.
</li><li> After the first manifestation of human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">biotics</a> in the 2150's, the Biotic Acclimation and Training program was forced to rely on aliens (often mercenaries) to serve as instructors to the students, due to the sheer lack of available information of the phenomenon. Similarly, early model biotic amplifiers were infamously bad, with the L1 configuration barely allowing someone to lift a cup, while the L2s contained a host of side-effects ranging from migraines to full-blown psychosis. The L3 model avoided side effects, but very rarely matches the power occasionally seen in L2s. By the time of the second game, humans are experimenting with L4s and L5s.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, Sabin, (a martial artist that spent the better half of 10 years living secluded in a wooded valley,) Cyan (a technophobe samurai,) and Shadow (a ninja who lives off the land and presumably doesn't hang around machines much) all manage to be able to use Magitek Armor within minutes of finding some. However, Cyan initially cannot pilot his armor, and Sabin comes from a kingdom with highly advanced technology, so at least in his case this may be somewhat justified.
<ul><li> A better example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. The prequels show that Cloud is a very poor shot, even with automatic weaponery. However, he's able to pick up a SOLDIER sword and use it to dispatch said SOLDIERs. It can be reasonably assumed that Limits helped, but the point is still made that he has a natural affinity for swordsmanship.
<ul><li> A similar scene occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>.

</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, Link was trained at a Knight Academy before the game starts, justifying his ability with a sword. And maybe his increased amount of hearts (six as opposed to the usual three).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a> 2</em>, a Marine Frigate is able to dock with an enemy ship and deploy commandos to take it over from the inside. After a successful hijacking however, the commandos are apparently able to fight with their new ship just as effectively as the previous crew without first having to familiarize themselves with how to operate it.
</li><li> While previously this trope was averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> with everyone's weapon skill starting out at one, in patch 4.0.1 weapons skills and training were done away with - now your character automatically fits this trope, so long as they can equip the weapon. This was because weapon skill added nothing whatsoever to the game, and simply resulted in higher level people who acquired a new type of weapon having to spend a lot of time hacking away pathetically at equally pathetic creatures while grinding their weapon skill up through 400-odd skill points before they could fight real enemies again (death knights, starting at level 55 and initially untrained in several of their common weapons, were particularly troubled by this).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 2</em> plays with this trope. On one hand, your character doesn't seem to have any trouble using captured German weapons, but that's no surprise given that small arms tend to be similar no matter where they're from. On the other hand, Private Macgregor's attempts at driving a captured German armored car were less than impressive.
</li><li> Particularly egregious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies">Nazi Zombies</a></em>, where everyone instantly knows how to use the new Wonder Weapon introduced in each map to electrocute zombies, shrink them, turn them back into humans, suck them into a miniature black hole, etc. Especially in the Call Of The Dead map, where the player characters are <em>actors</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a> 2</em>, any ships captured by boarding can be used as one's own, but scrapping them gives a chance to learn any unknown technologies they use.
</li><li> The protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> picks up a wide array of techniques and can perform them effectively with little or no training at all - the Spirit Thief technique is demonstrated <em>once</em>, the transformation powers are gained by defeating the same monster, and several weapon styles become available after you've gained the weapon. You can effortlessly swing <em>two</em> massive axes without a second of prior training, and can service, load, wield and fire a blunderbuss imported from an analogue of Britain. And then there's the flying crafts that you've had no experience with either...
</li><li> The ease with which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Exile</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> picks up new lightsaber forms ends up being a plot point later.
</li><li> Similar to the <em>Mass Effect</em> example, the Covenant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> have lots of tech superior to that of the UNSC. Luckily for humanity, they don't seem to understand it much better than we do. In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike">Halo: First Strike</a></em>, Cortana manages to vastly improve the performance of a Covenant cruiser by fiddling with the settings and immediately gets yelled at by the Covenant AI for "blasphemy". Yes, the Covenant deliberately shoot themselves in the foot by even making their AIs constrained by religious dogma.
<ul><li> More generally, Halo goes the extra mile to justify the fact that the player character can operate everything from a sniper rifle to a rocket launcher as well as alien weapons, or do things like control (almost) every vehicle he comes across. The Master Chief has neural augmentations that allow him to learn faster, along with extensive training in every possible scenario he could find himself in, such as piloting aircraft or driving tanks, and even using alien technology. Later Halo games do not emphasize the fact that this is a special result of Spartan abilities and feature things such as ordinary Marines flying covenant aircraft without any kind of training or experience.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, capturing an alien ship with a boarding pod allows you to fire the ship's weapons but not move it. Slightly justified in that everybody apparently uses the same types of weapons (a human-designed red laser is exactly the same as a Tarka-designed one), while the engine technology might be different (e.g. Liir ships teleport through space and lack traditional engines; Tarka can also get rid of traditional engines by topping their hyperdrive tech tree). It can also be justified in the case of telepathic races, such as the Liir and the Zuul, who can pull information out of the enemy's head (the Zuul particularly enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>).
</li><li> Shirou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> develops <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ability to construct imitations of legendary swords out of his prana</span>. The full technique also recreates the history of the weapon and allows Shirou to sympathize with its experiences, allowing him to imitate the skills of the previous wielders and display some proficiency.
<ul><li> Inverted in "Unlimited Blade Works". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh and Shirou</span> both possess an immense number of weapons, but are simply "owners" who lack true mastery of them. Against a "wielder" who had spent years fighting with such a weapon they would be completely outclassed in direct combat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou acknowledges this is the reason he can rival Gilgamesh, but would be defeated by any other Servant</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, Noire has never wielded a weapon, much less a bow, in her life. During the chapter where you recruit her, she finds a Steel Bow. And promptly starts shooting enemies. To put this into context: It takes a unit with a C rank in bows to shoot a Steel Bow. Most characters start with an E rank in bows. Your first Archer starts with a D rank in bows.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> with Garret's sword. He knows how to wield it at a basic level, but odds are that even the common guards in the game are better with a sword than the player ever will be. This is because Garret is, fundamentally, a thief, and tries to avoid combat in favor of stealth whenever possible. The sword is an absolute last resort.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OmegaQuintet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OmegaQuintet">Omega Quintet</a></em>. As proved several times, potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic">Verse Maidens</a> can destroy MAD and clear Blare in clutch situations - but only when desperate. Meaningfully applying the ability requires conscious effort and a decent singing voice; lack of training, laryngitis, or performance anxiety all render the user helpless. Additionally, the exact mechanism of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a> is poorly understood, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suspected to be a placebo effect <em>at best</em>. It's speculated that the girls would be much better off with military-grade armor and combat training instead of cute costumes and cameras, but this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagLine">singing may be their only hope</a>.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>, where it's not the titular Blue Bomber's lack of mastery which tends to give him a weaker and less effective version of the robot master's weapons he obtains, but rather that he lacks the specialized bodies of said masters which are used in conjunction with their weapon and instead has to adapt it to his Mega Buster. He instantly <em>knows</em> how to use said ability, but can't use it to its full potential due to physical limitations, essentially making him a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> in that regard.
</li><li> In full effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>, even though your Hunter is probably a rookie at the beginning of the game, you can still use all weapon-types and their moves right away, even the more non-conventional ones like the Insect Glaive and Chargeblade. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> justifies that by saying your character is already a veteran Hunter: a total rookie would never have been sent on an expedition to the New World.
</li><li> Averting it is an important game mechanic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Syndicate">Syndicate Wars</a></em>. You can use any weapon looted from enemies, even if you've never seen it before. But until you've taken the time to research it, every shot comes with the chance of instantly draining all your energy. You're forced to choose between using a more powerful but unreliable weapon, or junking it for research without knowing when you'll find another one.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> is devastatingly powerful in the right hands, but learning it requires either making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> or learning it from someone who already knows it. The former runs the risk of possession, and the latter means you're only getting what they were able to learn from someone <em>else</em> or the demon that gave them the knowledge.
</li><li> Magic itself is also horrendously powerful in the setting, despite the risk mages face of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>. However, most young mages, despite having magical abilities, have no real control or understanding of what they're capable of doing and require years of study to learn how to use their abilities safely and effectively.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Inquisitor</a> is able to use the mark on their hand that they've had for less than a day to open and close Fade rifts easily, even if they had no magical talent previously or are part of a race that can't use magic. However, while their skill with using the mark grows as the game progresses, by the end of the last DLC (set two years after the end of the game) they don't understand how exactly it works, only that it works.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>[[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a>/Dark Souls In the Souls series]]</em>, the player character can use any weapon and all of its techniques as long as they have the prerequisite stats to wield it. No explanation is ever given, though most of the weapons are made from the souls of their former masters...
