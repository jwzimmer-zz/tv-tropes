<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clow/Eriol</span> frequently manipulated the cast, threatened Sakura's friends and family, and even risked erasing everyone's feelings of love, and yet are still considered good because it was "necessary" for Sakura to be subjected to these things. (Sakura didn't want to be a mage at first, and in the anime it's not necessarily clear what the pressing reason was for her to become one. Clow's even responsible for the cards escaping when they did. In the manga, it's made clearer: if he didn't do what he did, the magic of the Clow Cards would fade, and two of her friends would die.)
</li><li> Also, at the end of both arcs, Sakura and the readers find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there was no "disaster" (everyone losing their feelings of love), and that Eriol made sure that nobody not already involved with the Cards was anywhere near his magical disturbances.

Goku refuses, partly because he wants to fight the Androids, and partly because he doesn't think it's right to kill someone who hasn't <em>technically</em> done anything wrong yet (forgetting that Gero was the lead scientist of the Red Ribbon Army, and so most of their tech was probably built by him).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: Goku Black feels that he has one since he comes from a 'higher place' and has 'seen the truth'.

</li><li> Kage Houshi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em>.
</li><li> The Truth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. Yes, he punishes those that try to unlock the secrets of the universe, reverse death, and attain ultimate power by taking away limbs, reproductive organs, entire bodies, and even somebody's entire being, but it's ultimately because he wants people to just make do with the lives they have and appreciate the gift they've been given.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoshuushouSamaNinomiyaKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoshuushouSamaNinomiyaKun">Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun</a></em>, the hero and heroine's family is a mass of absolute jerks willing to continuously mentally and physically torment the main characters, up to and including faking their own death just to get them riled up, as part of a "training" course. While they aren't explicitly stated to have God-like powers, their ability to be anywhere and everywhere at once borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> Debatable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, where protagonist Shinn Asuka and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> hero Kira Yamato ended up on opposite sides of the conflict, which obviously lead to trouble and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">flame wars</a> (which still continue years after the series' conclusion). Some fans claim the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">director insisted in interviews</a> that Shinn was always the hero, and that Kira had "strayed from the path of justice"; other fans of Kira and his allies insist that they were in the right and that Shinn was the "true villain". (That Shinn spends the climactic battle sidelined after being defeated and humbled by Kira's best friend Athrun, and had up to that point been fighting for the side that Kira and company were trying to stop from using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, probably had a lot to do with that perception.) <br/><br/>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">flame wars</a> have gotten so bad amongst Gundam fans, that even after all these years that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has changed his initial position, and now posits that Athrun was the main character. It hasn't helped.
</li><li> Aeolia Schenberg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> plays with this trope in that the plan to prevent future conflicts by attacking any person or force that may start or continue them is immediately considered ludicrous and foolhardy by pretty much the entire world in the very first episode. The protagonists themselves acknowledge that they are terrorists in form and function, but have already reconciled that their very violent approach is the only way to stop the fighting they themselves were victims of.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> series, Present Mikuru will accept any indignity, abuse or manipulation that her time-traveling superiors throw at her, because, you know, the future will get messed up if she doesn't. This is averted in the later books, when Kyon calls them on this, explicitly stating that he believes them to be manipulating Mikuru for their own selfish goals, and not for the good of the timeline. This is made even more tied to the timeline (creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>) because Present Mikuru's boss is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her future self.</span>

</li><li> There is also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, who decided to seal the Nine Tailed Demon Fox into Naruto, simply with the conviction that it was his responsibility as a parent to have faith in his recently born son's ability to set things right as motivation</span>. Contrary to the above example, this gambit is turning out surprisingly well, irresponsible though it was. Minato had another, better reason to do what he did. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If Kushina sacrificed the last few minutes of her life to temporarily kill the Kyuubi with her, the Kyuubi would have been resurrected at an unspecified time and place. Given who they were up against and the power of the Kyuubi (and his ability to control the Kyuubi), sealing it in Naruto at the cost of his life may have been the only guaranteed way to prevent another, more successful attack on Konoha.</span>

Due to their bloodline, they can do <em>'anything</em> and get away with it, no matter how reprehensible. If you try to resist, you get killed.

Curiously, although he's also from the future and is accompanied by a floating repository of 21st century history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> doesn't.

Ironically, he's now lost his position, become a wanted man, and had his world fall down around his ears. Bet you didn't see that one coming, eh Tony?
</li><li> Reed Richards of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> is also an example.
<ul><li> He saved the life of Galactus, the devourer of worlds. When a group of aliens put him on trial for crimes against the universe, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> that Galactus is somehow necessary to the survival of the universe (it later turns out that Galactus is the can for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> named Abraxas). How, or even whether, Reed knew this when he saved Galactus is debatable, though it should be mentioned that what brings the decision in favor of Galactus is the embodiment of the Universe itself showing up to testify in Galactus' favor. This was more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, though. He could have been extrapolating from nature. Remove a predator from an environment and often the environment will become overrun with its prey. It's still hard to justify since Galactus and his victims are often sapient and free-willed.
</li><li> Reed Richards exemplifies the trope again during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the central concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Foundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Foundation">Foundation</a></em> series; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalFieldOfScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalFieldOfScience">fictional mathematical science</a> of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)">psychohistory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (wherein one can, with enough time and mathematical expertise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrescienceByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrescienceByAnalysis">predict the generalized "future history" of mankind through mathematical formulae</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Using his new mathematical science, Reed Richards discovers that if the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanRegistrationAct">Superhuman Registration Act</a>, which would require all superhumans to register their identities with the government regardless if they rely on the identities' secrecy for their own or loved ones' safety, doesn't pass and come into law the resulting fallout would lead to the deaths of <em>billions</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> Subverted to the point of deconstruction in an issue of Impact Comics' <em>Jaguar</em>.

The theory his helpless foster parents eventually pieced together is that his species experiences time nonlinearly, seeing past, present, and future all at once, so he kills people for horrible crimes they <em>haven't committed yet</em> — thereby of course making it kind of hard to demonstrate what they <em>would</em> one day have done to deserve death had they gotten the chance...

</li><li> Odin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> comics has pulled a number of questionable actions over the years. It is usually rationalized that as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">king</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">skyfather</a> Odin has higher priorities than others, along with Odin often having a far better idea of what is going on and the potential consequences.

<ul><li> One of the students has an ability that can best be described as hypercognition, an ability to form connections and make deductions that completely ignore quantum uncertainty and chaos theory. This leads to doing no small amount of questionable acts.
</li><li> Tom Davidson, who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, has much the same deal going on.
</li></ul></li><li> Morpheus has a habit of behaving like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, called out in one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight">Delirium's occasional moments of incisive lucidity</a> — "you just act like you know stuff I don't know and that makes everything you do OK." The only truly omniscient member of the Endless is Destiny, and he follows a strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">non-interference clause</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a></em> seems to think he has this, as he executes his chosen calling — punishing those who commit crimes — in the most horrific ways, and doesn't discriminate; even something as minor as a child filching coins from their mother's purse warrants the same nightmarish "ironic death" as a mass-murderer.
<ul><li> This actually presents an interesting interpretation as to why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">the Spectre will never return to Heaven</a>; he actually takes his role far, far further than God desires. Until the Spectre finally gets clued in from his human hosts that he does <em>not</em> have one of these, he'll continue to disgust his creator so much that he will never allow the borderline demon to sully Heaven's halls again.
</li><li> And this really just pushes the license back on The Voice (DC's on-again off-again attempt to avoid offending anyone by explicitly calling him "God"). "Spectre, you're a dick, so rather have you in Heaven where you can't really hurt Me, I'm going to send you off to Earth to do horrible things to mortals who can't defend themselves against you." Yes, the Spectre's victims generally "deserve it", but the terrifying thing is that by the Spectre's logic, <em>everyone</em> "deserves it." We can only hope he goes after people in order of the egregiousness of their sins and that we die of other causes before he gets around to us.
</li><li> The Spectre once went completely overboard with his License during a period of time when he wasn't bound to a host. Under Eclipso's influence, he slaughtered most of the DC verse's magical community. The Voice finally had enough of these antics when The Spectre murdered the last remaining Lord of Order, Nabu, and promptly revoked the Spectre's license and shoved him into a new mortal host. The Voice typically operates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays">In Mysterious Ways</a> — that it took direct action here highlights just how upset it was.
<ul><li> It's important to note that Spectre was manipulated by Eclipso during this time and — though still flawed logic — thought he was doing the universe a favor by wiping out magic users who regularly break the laws of reality, which is a viewpoint at least worth debating. What's completely terrifying are the off-the-wall punishments he was dealing out BEFORE his wrath was targeted on the magic community. Destroying a wizard because he can shoot fire from his hands could be considered a preemptive measure. Impaling a man with a giant pen for tax fraud or cutting a girl's head off for being disrespectful to her parents is just insanity.

Why? Because oracular water spirits told him that the android would be a key factor in defeating Ultron. It is because of this that the android is given the name <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vision">Vision</a>. And when Vision's motives are questioned, he unwittingly proves his goodness by lifting Thor's hammer — even though a scene earlier in the film implied that most of the Avengers didn't really consider lifting the hammer proof of anything (but mostly because none of them could lift it themselves, with the exception of Steve "Captain America" Rogers who it's implied could lift it but chooses not to).</span> Can't argue with Asgardians, can you?

Then, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during his battle (assisted with Iron Man, Spider-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy) vs. Thanos in Titan, as Thanos heavily wounds Tony, Strange decides to give his Time Stone to Thanos (who was seeking it) to spare Tony.

The title character does random, chaotic, highly disruptive, and seemingly pointless things, but said actions unfailingly serve to benefit <em>someone</em> in the end. One of the best examples was when Fred sinks the protagonist's friend's houseboat. The owner of the houseboat later received a massive insurance payout, far larger than what she expected, and was able to buy a much nicer house as a result.

"Do you think God'll forgive us for what we've done?" "No." Which is an interesting take on the concept. If he's already irredeemable, there's no reason to have any moral compunction left.

Those nannies waiting in line in the beginning did <em>not</em> deserve to get blown away in a windstorm, no matter how stuffy they were. Her presence also seems to spread a magical flying hysteria that kills the Bank President, but hey, he "was his happiest in years."
</li><li> After a certain point, the entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck">Paycheck</a></em> is the main character, Michael Jennings, doing this to himself. He was hired to build a future-viewing machine, with the contract stipulating that his memories would be wiped afterward so he couldn't reveal how it worked. When he goes to collect his payment, he finds that he waived it before the memory wipe. Instead, he is given a large envelope full of seemingly random objects. It is eventually revealed that when testing the machine, he saw a horrific future, possibly caused by the existence of the machine. So, using the machine, he worked out a collection of objects to leave for himself that would result in him blundering his way through saving the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He worked it out so that he would get a happy ending, but of course he no longer knows this when the time comes and he finds himself facing seemingly imminent and completely unavoidable death.</span>
</li><li> Although not explicitly stated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, Obi-Wan and Yoda used Luke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">From a Certain Point of View</a> as what they felt was the best way to get him to stop Vader and the Emperor. In the end it's subverted, as Luke wins by NOT heeding their advice. If he had killed Vader like they asked, the Emperor would have won.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">the original novel</a>, this is because it <em>wasn't</em> Glinda (who's the witch of the South) Dorothy met in the beginning, but the other Good Witch, who didn't know how the shoes worked. Presumably, the movie didn't want to use more actors than it had to. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz">The Wiz</a></em> provides one adaptation that kept this plot element.

But the main characters point out that out of everyone in Newton Haven, only two or three people haven't been replaced, and that the Network isn't helping humanity, it's destroying it. After an argument, the Network decides that it's not worth it and leaves Earth, taking most of modern technology with it.</span>

No matter what he does to whom (including in one book turning a class of schoolchildren into pigs with no indication that they'll ever turn back), both the protagonists and the reader are expected to take it on faith that it's good and right because he's so transparently supposed to be Lion!Jesus.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>, Fizban's way of helping people is by being a nuisance and hindering the progress of the heroes, even when it endangers their lives. It turns out his hindrances end up helping them in the end, and that is his unique way of helping them out. He can do this because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his secret identity is none other than Paladine, the chief god of light.</span>
<ul><li> Really, the entire setting's theology is built on this, with the notorious Cataclysm — where <em>all</em> gods, Good, Neutral and Evil, abducted all of their priests from the mortal world and unleashed an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a> on the planet because of the arrogance of a mad theocrat who was slaughtering everyone who didn't fit his definition of good — being the worst example.

Duncan Idaho in particular takes issue with it, as well as Leto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">transformation into a nigh-immortal sandworm/human hybrid</a>. When queried, Leto argues that the higher morality conferred by his gift of prescience compels him to act in ways that seem unimaginably cruel when the alternative is the complete extinction of humanity. <br/><br/>To be specific, humanity needed melange for space travel. Melange could only be found on Arrakis, so humanity had confined itself to planets close to it. Leto II realized that if they continued on this path, humanity would die out. To counter this, he ruled over humanity in a reign spanning thousands of years, restricting both their freedom and travel. This was so that as soon as he died, humanity would satisfy a three and a half millennia long thirst for freedom and travel and explode out beyond the reach of known space. Humanity would thus be spread out so far and have no vital center, and would thus never end. Leto called it the "Golden Path." He stated that his father, Paul Muad'dib, also saw the Golden Path, but was too frightened to start it. There was also another part to it; prescience itself is a trap, since once something is foreseen it becomes inevitable. He used his rule to spread the previously unique genetics and technology that render people immune to it far and wide, so nobody can pull this crap again.
</li><li> It's revealed in the sixth book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse">Emberverse</a></em> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowersThatBe">The Powers That Be</a> are the ones who knocked humanity back to the bronze age, killing billions, because they had foreseen a bad future leading to the extinction of humanity</span>.

Whitehall is a volunteer in this enterprise and retains his free will — except that center is for all intents and purposes omniscient, and can always show him vividly, with a stated degree of probability, <em>exactly</em> what outcome will result from a given choice, so that Whitehall really has only one way to go.

He even knew, or at least guessed, that Harry could survive as long as it was Voldemort that delivered the Killing Curse, but by letting Harry think he would die, enabled Harry to grant his friends the same protection his mother had given him by her sacrifice.

</li><li> In <em>Mage Storms</em>, the Gods themselves are revealed to have been playing this game for millennia; nearly every single one of the myriad disasters and near-disasters that have occurred since the first Cataclysm was engineered for the specific purpose of putting in place all the pieces necessary to avert the second Cataclysm.

<ul><li> This <em>looks</em> like an Omniscient Morality License to most client species, but the books explicitly justify the Arisian policy: the Arisians are perfectly capable of defending themselves and could even kill <strong>most</strong> of the Eddorians outright at the time they become aware of them, but they couldn't get them all, and they couldn't protect anyone else against the remnant. They want very much to help Civilization, but if they do so too openly, the Eddorians will work out that they exist, and that won't go well for anyone. This means they <em>have</em> to let the Eddorians nearly destroy the client species over and over again while working in the shadows to salvage what they can and give one of their client races time to develop minds even more powerful than the Arisians themselves and that can exterminate the Eddorians completely.

The Valar can and do make mistakes in pursuit of a greater good, despite (and sometimes <em>because</em>) of their good intentions. The narrative implies that several of their actions where they intervened directly to improve the lives of Elves and Men (such as bringing the Elves to Aman, or giving Númenor and extended life to the Edain) were entirely the wrong thing to do, even if they were motivated by the best intentions. Some of their other actions (such as releasing Melkor, or sending the Istari to Middle Earth) also had bad results due to lack of foresight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil">or an inability to understand how good things can become evil</a>).

<ul><li> The Diagram, a plan written by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Taravangian of Kharbranth</span> on one of the days when his randomly fluctuating intelligence was at nigh-omniscient levels. The precise plan isn't revealed until the third book, but it involves predicting events all over the world leading up to the inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Desolation</a>, and finding a way for humanity to survive it. It starts with assassinating every other ruler in the world, and gets darker from there. One of the minor side plots of the organization involves slowly killing hundreds of people a day in hopes of collecting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone">Death Rattles</a> and discovering more about what is coming. Even with these patches, holes and flaws are still appearing, and the plan is falling farther and farther off the rails. It should be noted that the Diagram staunchly opposes the heroes (long before the heroes even know the organization exists), because they are working to refound the Knights Radiant, ten orders bound firmly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, who would never allow this plan to move ahead. When the plan is finally revealed, it turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> for Taravangian to become the ruler of the world, thus putting him in a position of enough power to negotiate favourable terms of surrender to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Odium</a>, since the Diagram claims that there is no reasonable way for humanity to win against him.</span>

In order to do that, they are willing to kill whoever gets in their way and insist it is all for the greater good without explaining their actual plan at all. Even worse, they're unaware that the Heralds <em>never left</em>, and that instead they just gave up their oaths and abandoned humanity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Gavilar</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Highmarshal Amaram</span> were both members of this group.

<ul><li> Annalina Aldurren often invokes this trope, believing that she has a right to steer the protagonist's life because she's spent hers studying prophecies about him. She is quite often called out on this by the other characters (most notably said protagonist's wife), is more often than not wrong in her interpretations of the prophecies, and on several occasions suggests doing things such as erasing the protagonist's memory and having another character seduce him in order to have him do what she thinks he should. In fact, it's outright stated that, had she not meddled in the protagonist's life in the first place, many of the events of the series would never have taken place. Interestingly, Anna is called on this and finally broken of the habit, only for the villains to mess with the timeline/people's memories and her to revert to form.
</li><li> In the same series, Nathan Rahl occasionally delves into this territory, but is more successful as he's an actual prophet, and gets the total experience and meaning of his prophecies. A more or less straight example: When he's introduced, it's mentioned that while entertaining a young woman, something he whispers to her makes her run screaming from his room, and eventually leads to a civil war and tens of thousands dead. Much later, he remarks that in that war, a pregnant woman died whose child otherwise would have grown into a horrible dictator who would have killed far, far more.

<ul><li> The Aes Sedai all act like this, to the extreme annoyance of both characters and readers. To be fair, some of them are smart enough that things do kind of work out. Others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">not so much</a>.
</li><li> Rand adopts a similar attitude as time goes on.

The Ctaeh, a faerie oracle, is the ultimate evil. It uses its omniscience to guide whoever converses with it to their doom (and normally to cause massive chaos in the outside world). An entire faction of Sidhe exist just to keep everyone away.

Justified (albeit by Humfry himself) in that if he gives his supplicants the full story, they'd get things wrong and go straight for the end goal, instead of going through the experience and ally gaining journey actually needed to succeed. (That, and most Xanthians expect to be given the runaround, trusting that things will work out in the end.)

<ul><li> The Vorlons acted like this was in force, and pretty much everyone went along with it for the first half (or so) of the show's run. As soon as the main characters start to question it, all hell breaks loose.
</li><li> The Shadows did this too, but from the opposite direction. Basically, the Vorlon thought the best way to foster the younger races was through Order; forging alliances so the whole is stronger than the parts. The Shadows believed that strength was born of Chaos; get everyone killing each other, and the victors would be stronger than when they'd started. The problem, and the proof that this trope was not in effect, was that after a while, both sides forgot why they were doing it, they just wanted to prove that their philosophy was the correct one. And us younger races were caught in the middle.

</li><li> Rube in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> seems to have this. In the pilot episode, he basically tells George to start taking people's souls, or else, without offering any explanation as to why. When she, quite understandably, refuses, the consequences are dire, and she is berated for doing what anyone with a conscience would have done.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The TARDIS.

Of course, she tends to spend most of her time dropping her Time Lord and his human friends off in places where they experience terrible danger and often nearly get killed (and sometimes <em>do</em> get killed), ostensibly for the greater good. Despite this the new series straight-up reimagines her as the Doctor's "wife".
</li><li> The Time Lords often come across as this before their reinvention as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>. For example, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E4TheMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS9E4TheMutants">"The Mutants"</a>, they give the Doctor a container to deliver, but they won't tell him what's in the container, or who's supposed to receive it, and then dump him and his assistant Jo on a planet at war and with an atmosphere toxic to humans. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E1TerrorOfTheAutons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E1TerrorOfTheAutons">"Terror of the Autons"</a>, a Time Lord in human clothing appears to inform the Doctor that the Master is active on Earth and encourages him to fight back, but provides absolutely no useful information other than this. They send the Doctor to revive the Sacred Flame on Karn in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius">"The Brain of Morbius"</a>, but this is only implied by the fact that they dump him on Karn at all (notably, when Maren becomes convinced the Doctor's a Time Lord spy, he agrees he might be, as far as he knows).
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor did a lot of dodgy, risky things for the greater good that were treated by the plot as fun and lovely because the Doctor is a genius and knew it would all be alright  like manipulating Sarah Jane, bullying Leela and making people who trusted him think he'd gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a>. A lot of what the series later did with the Tenth Doctor is a deconstruction of the morality of this tenure.
</li><li> Toward the end of the classic series, during the epoch known to fans as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartmel_Masterplan">"The Cartmel Masterplan"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Doctor could often be found pushing the bounds of morality, justified by the incredibly complex machinations of his long-term plans, and the desire of the production team to inject a new sense of mystery into the character.
</li><li> The Tenth Doctor has shown tendencies towards this too; subverted in that the show treats it as a character flaw, and a very serious one at that. Of course, Ten also gets incredibly worked up over perceived injustices and forms strong emotional attachments to characters he's only known for a few hours, in contrast to classic Doctors who held a much more detached attitude. The Doctor's OML finally expired in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">"The Waters of Mars"</a>, where he tries to interfere with a fixed point in time and save a woman who, for the sake of humanity's future development, absolutely must die. She gives him a deeply angry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speech <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then kills herself, just to right the timeline</span>.
</li><li> The Eleventhth Doctor still has moments of this  he is almost as manipulative and secretive as Seven when it comes to using his companions as chess pieces, and the show is more reserved about treating it unambiguously as a character flaw. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2010CSAChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2010CSAChristmasCarol">"A Christmas Carol"</a> (which was even adapted from a Seventh Doctor story written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor uses time travel to rewrite someone's personality by manipulating their life until that point, and while Kazran in his original state is an awful person, the show glosses over the fact that he's not <em>making the choice</em> to become better as you would normally expect in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol">Yet Another Christmas Carol</a> plot, but having his life modified by an external person who knows the outcome. Kazran objects to what is happening at first, but (while its working) becomes a happier person as a result. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> from his love interest spins him back to misery and old Kazran is delighted to throw the futility of it in the Doctor's face.
<ul><li> Alternately, if one looks at it in a timey-wimey way, the Doctor is helping <em>young</em> Kazran choose to become a better person, by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> showing him just how much like his father he might end up</span> and making sure he had at least one person in his life whom he loved (and who loved him back) to act as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a> when it came time to make the decision faced by <em>old</em> Kazran.
</li></ul></li><li> The Twelfth Doctor, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero">Pragmatic Hero</a>, has his own problems which are treated as major flaws in-universe. Unlike Ten and Eleven, he's <em>far</em> more detached from others. He doesn't <em>like</em> manipulating others for the sake of saving the day, and he knows he doesn't have an OML  but he has to do <em>something</em> to put a lid on the threat of the week.
<ul><li> In Series 8, when faced with an important but non-fixed point in time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon">"Kill the Moon"</a>, rather than just making an informed choice (either kill or spare the Moon creature) for humanity, he leaves it up to them and Clara in particular  trusting and believing that she will make the choice he would and all will be well. He also deliberately withholds <em>critical</em> information supporting the correct choice, meaning Clara is forced to go with her gut against all reason and available evidence. While she <em>does</em> make that choice and everything <em>is</em> okay, she is furious with the Doctor for being condescending and cruel to her and humanity by abandoning them, and they are estranged for a time. It's more or less the flipside of the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">"The Waters of Mars"</a>. He meant well with his non-interference in the fates of others and the audience knows he does <em>not</em> see humans as small, as she claims  a speech he gives to the Half-Face Man in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">"Deep Breath"</a> says as much, but she wasn't there for that  but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> and Clara having come to expect him to save the day for others all the time (having travelled extensively with Eleven and also met Ten and War) means he is horribly misunderstood.

He rejects her "gift" and instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lets one of the Cybermen  Clara's late boyfriend, who has resisted cyber-control  make the choice over what will become of them</span>.
</li><li> In Series 9 he becomes increasingly frustrated with having to hold back from using his full abilities for the sake of time and space's stability, owing to all the losses he experiences as a result. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E4BeforeTheFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E4BeforeTheFlood">"Before the Flood"</a>, he is chewed out over letting someone die to confirm what the villain's plan is, and later tries to break his own rules to save Clara, whom he is in love with by this point. In a moment of grief in the next episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied">"The Girl Who Died"</a>, he defies the fates and saves the sweet titular girl from death's door in a way that also makes her immortal. He almost immediately regrets it when his high emotions have passed, and it comes back to haunt him terribly. In the 3-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>, when Clara <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a></span> and he is forced to undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> immediately afterwards, the resultant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> leads to him temporarily becoming an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> who's <em>sure</em> he won't destroy the universe by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving her from her fixed-point death</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor has moments of this as well. She does nominally <em>say</em> that she and her companions are a very "flat-team structure," but in truth, she's still the one making the decisions, and if any of her companions dare to question her, she makes it very clear to them that their opinions and judgments <em>don't matter</em> because they don't know as much as she does and they could never make the choices that she has to make.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia">Joan of Arcadia</a></em>, God gave Joan her "assignments" with little to no concern about how Joan's activities would be perceived and reacted to by her family and friends. At least twice, Joan's life was directly endangered by her following God's orders.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in the second episode where God tells Joan to join AP Chemistry. Joan becomes partners with Grace and Adam and invites them over to her house for a study session. Adam recognizes Joan's father (the police chief) who his dad works for as head of the police impound lot. Joan's mother looks at the stock at the lot and finds that there is a car with hand controls which will give mobility to their paralyzed son, which in turn starts to break him out of his depression. When Joan points this out and who she got what God was trying to teach her, God further explains that this isn't a vacuum. All of those actions will have an effect on the world that Joan couldn't begin to understand and it was all because she did something as simple as sign up for a new class, handily demonstrating to the viewers what would happen for the rest of the series.

His ultimate goal is to prove wrong the theory of his nameless archenemy, who thinks humans are inherently flawed with sin, and so he allows them to form their own ideas of good and bad on the island while avoiding corruption by the nemesis. If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacob</span> intervenes, so he believes, his theory will be worthless: they must make their own decisions without his guiding hand. Regardless, in getting characters to the island, he has exercised some moral license: allowing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sayid's wife Nadia</span> to be killed or knowing the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">plane they intended to return to the island on</span> would crash.
</li><li> The Great Dragon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> has advised/ordered Merlin to do some <em>incredibly</em> dodgy stuff, including letting a child die and poisoning a terrified woman. Sometimes he obeys, sometimes he doesn't — but either way it usually turns out bad for Merlin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a>,</em> senior Knight Daggeron sends the young 'uns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">without their gear</a> to test their mettle, and doesn't stick around to watch (he had to go take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>). Our heroes very nearly wind up as a giant's breakfast. When they manage to get themselves out of it and return, Daggeron's "I never doubted their safe return" just doesn't ring true - you <em>really</em> feel like the writers threw the line in so that Daggeron wouldn't appear to be criminally irresponsible. To be fair, Daggeron <em>appeared</em> to have arranged the whole thing, since the giant was a vegetarian and he had conveniently given the green ranger an inane task of practicing the spell he would need over and over again. So either this trope or sloppy script work.
</li><li> The Inquisitor, the villain of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episode of the same name, behaved as though he has one. After surviving to the end of time, he concludes that there is no god and no afterlife, and that the only purpose of existence is to live a worthwhile life. To this end, he travels through time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">deletes</a> those he judges to have wasted their lives and replaces them with another possible version of themselves.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em> featured a world with abundant and apparently legitimate psychics. The foremost psychic in the United States holds the government position of Prime Oracle, functioning as the de facto head of government in all matters in which it becomes involved, and is responsible for preventing or mitigating every major disaster since the office was created. The Slider's first encounter with the current Prime Oracle is when he tries and fails to run Wade over with his car. This trope is apparent when the police tell her that if her story is true, then he must have had a good reason for doing so. His license even extends to choosing his successor, who inherits that license by virtue of being chosen by someone who had it.

<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> moment, Daniel Jackson fits this trope. He's been to heaven and back, most of his ideas and choices are good, and he even has the right, power and morality justification to question ascended beings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> later when he becomes a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prior</span> and asks for a <em>little</em> cooperation for his latest plan (his CV should have spoken for himself). He's not, but he proves his worth and his loyalty, and his actions are still the ones saving the day.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, SG-1 and Stargate Command is for the countries of Earth who don't profit as much from the technology as the US, and want to screw the ones that actually work in the process. They still do what they know best, and save the world(s) through it every time.

Beautifully subverted in the <em>Next Generation</em> episode "True Q", in which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">nigh-omnipotent</a> Q, in one of his rare straight-faced moments, tries to claim this license as the Continuum's right to judge and possibly execute the half-Q, half-human Amanda for being too potentially dangerous to live. When he responds to Picard's questioning that right with the simple, terse words "superior morality", Picard nearly chokes: "superior <em>morality</em>? I haven't seen any evidence of any morality at all!" It also turns up in the series finale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E24AllGoodThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E24AllGoodThings">"All Good Things..."</a>:

To do this, one of them took control of a woman named Sarah and forced her to romance, marry, and have a child with Joseph Sisko; she left as soon as her body was returned to her. Which sounds a lot like rape, but <em>that</em> implication is never brought up. The heartache it caused Joseph Sisko is, as he thought there was a legitimate romance going on and had no idea why Sarah left so abruptly. The one time Sisko asks prophet-Sarah "why?" her answer amounts to there having been a <em>chance</em> Sarah would make choices that didn't result in Ben being in born, and since Ben <em>must</em> exist, this "risk" justified their actions</span>
<ul><li> In the pilot, it was implied that the prophets only had a loose concept of what they were doing and needed Sisko to explain linear existence to them. Sisko, and even Quark at one point, second guessed and even lectured them when they did something wrong. It wasn't until the introduction of their very linear, multi-season battle with the Pah Wraiths that the show started treating them as gods rather than aliens.

Many villains are ex-Travelers who have, effectively, lost faith after seeing too many of the Director's supposed "best possible choices" appear to lead to nothing good.

</li><li> In the "Atlas of Earth-Prime: Mexico" sourcebook for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> 3rd edition, we're introduced to Tlacaelel, a Mexica noble from when the Aztec empire was first founded, who was granted immortality and immense magical powers when he subdued and absorbed the manifest Spirit of the Mexica Nation. Doing so granted him the apparent understanding that Mexica's glory would only survive if it was spiritually split; by keeping the nation locked in eternal turmoil, that greater conflict would swallow up and negate any external influences on Mexica's soul. To this end, he has been directly responsible for many of the tragedies to befall Mexico, from the massacres and near-genocide of the Spanish conquistadors (to forge a stronger nation from the once-disparate tribes under Spanish influence), the nation's loss in the American-Mexican War (to shed nations tainted by slavery and shield Mexico from the Mayombe cult), and culminating in directly supporting the modern era's prevalent drug wars. His current ploy boils down to supporting various criminal and super-criminal groups, whilst secretly leaking key information to heroic factions, ensuring perpetual war between both. However, the trope is zigzagged in that it's noted that Tlacaelel's taking of the Spirit by force meant he only got <em>half</em> of the Spirit; the Serpent, embodiment of the material world, and the Eagle is still out there. It's subtly implied that this actually gave him a faulty vision and he's been in the wrong all along despite thinking of himself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>... but, for the most part, the booklet falls firmly on the side of "he's been doing the right thing, or at least started out that way".

Despite the fact that this will explicitly cause all magic to vanish forever, resulting in the extinction of every magical creature and most non-human races, as well as causing Glantri to collapse (or be annihilated in a nuclear inferno), Khoronus acts as though this is a perfectly justified act, simply because, he claims, humans will ultimately master science once magic has been destroyed.

He could have solved it conventionally, but that would have damaged his ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">Save the Villain</a>. Most of the time he's actually pretty straightforward about his moving-people-around-the-board ploys; given his ability to confront problems that exist anywhere besides the psychoplanes almost always consists of "knowing more than anyone else" and 'communicating with people,' he <em>has</em> to do his part by networking.
</li><li> Rillian the Necromancer has it much worse.

On one hand, Fate is a literal cosmic force, and whatever the Predictamancers predict <em>will</em> come true, by definition. (Whether the Predictamancers <em>tell</em> the real predictions are a whole other story.) On the other hand, both of the introduced Predictamancers have an annoyingly vague approach to telling their predictions, and give little to no help for anyone featured in their predictions, instead preferring to try and manipulate things from the side.
<ul><li> It's implied that this is less because Predictamancers deliberately hold back info than it is because higher-level Predictions themselves are hyperfocused on one specific event that one specific unit will do sometime in the future (e.g. one unit is Predicted to "croak the leader of Haffaton", and both the leader and the method of croaking end up different than expected between prophecy and fulfillment).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>: Played perhaps uncomfortably straight with the Tao, which ostensibly always guides its Handmaid to do just what is required to maintain 'the balance'. However, the Demon Lord of the Hell of Firey Immersion, has hinted that the information Chou received was lies. Whether it was speaking the truth or not, we don't know. The ability to apparently predict the future is also not a original power of the Tao, but given by some magical loom and tapestry that we don't know much about.
<ul><li> The omniscient-seeming Mrs. Potter may also count, though she seems to be more unambiguously on the side of the angels than many of the usual trope examples.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DarkMatter2525" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DarkMatter2525">DarkMatter2525</a></em>: Whenever Jeffrey questions the ethical implications of Yahweh's atrocities, as well as the hypocrisies of not allowing others to do the same, Yahweh usually whips this trope out in one form or another, claiming things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">Screw the Rules, I Make Them!</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">the fact that he is defined as the ultimate good and thus whenever he does something, it is not considered bad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward">Ward</a></em> often deconstruct the idea when precognitives get involved in world-altering events.
<ul><li> The poster child is Cauldron, a secret organization that does many, *many* terrible things for the purpose of saving humanity from something that will probably kill 99% of the population some years down the line if nothing is done. Whether or not they were justified is a point of contention in and out of universe, especially since it's been demonstrated that precognition is never perfect.
</li><li> In <em>Ward</em>, Dinah Alcott is known to be behind fostering anti-parahuman sentiments, which seems paradoxical since she is a known parahuman herself. Eventually she reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had foreseen that anti-parahuman hatred was inevitable, but by fostering it and directing it herself, she could minimize the damage it caused. This seems to have backfired when another precog with their own morality license interferes and ruins all her plans.</span>

As a whole, the series is a subversion of this notion: by Korra's time, the very role of the Avatar as an infallible moral figure is seriously questioned, and most antagonists are ideologically opposed to this idea.

They do all sorts of terrifying, inscrutable things while steadfastly refusing to explain their reasons, arrogantly claiming the Transformers couldnt comprehend them. In the season one finale, they try to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>blow up the entire planet</em></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">just because the Transformers contaminated their precious experiment by total accident</a>.

"So he's the strongest, most evil ghost in the Ghost Zone. So what." No wonder some fans think him to be evil. Clockwork has the advantage of knowing everything, or at least all the outcomes. It's in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>. The fact that he never used his knowledge for outright good or evil shows that he's being neutral about using his power. That said, he does ultimately help the heroes stop Dark Danny and becomes Dark Danny's jailor. He also later helps Danny cure his friends of a deadly disease, pressing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> when Danny accidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">made wrong what once went right</a> and intentionally giving him the clue needed to fix the problem in the <em>present</em>. It seems Clockwork's overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">Dungeon Master</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> animated series. He uses <em>children</em> to carry out potentially fatal quests that work towards his enigmatic goals. Although he could easily defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Venger</a> and most of the other threats to the Realm, he prefers to use the kids to do it under the pretense of helping them get back to Earth. He is actually capable of just sending them home, but either gets evasive or disappears when asked to do so.
</li><li> A mild version of this can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em>: to prevent history from "unweaving", the crew needs to engage in some morally objectionable actions (making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> have a mental breakdown, create mutual tension between the Hatfields and the McCoys, etc.)
