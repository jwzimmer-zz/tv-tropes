If a character dies with something important in their pocket, you may not be able to get the item again (this happened in the NES version). If they die with something super important, like the old rusty key, and nobody else can access it, someone is going to sit in the dungeon forever. Some versions avert this, however, by placing a package on the kid's grave that contains all the items they were hauling around.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The original game gently pulls this stunt a couple times; twice, JC will be asked in dialogue to hand the best sidearm he's holding to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPC</a> in order to trigger marginally improved plot outcomes. These NPCs will have no interest in returning said weapons when they're done with them; this is made worse by the fact that most players will have used rare upgrades on these guns. Fortunately, this can be averted while achieving these plotlines' "good" endings by dropping the "good" weapons on the ground and grabbing an unmodified gun for the NPCs from the level.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>, you have the option to hand <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">van Bruggen</span> one of your weapons to allow him to escape a Belltower ambush unscathed (he'll die if you don't). It doesn't have to be your <em>best</em> weapon, just any in your inventory, but if the only weapons you have are customized and upgraded, be ready to hear about your failure to save him repeatedly over half of the remaining game. It doesn't matter if you devote your every action to protecting him; it doesn't even matter if you clear out the area while he safely hides in this little alcove so that there's no one left to kill him; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">if a gun is not physically in his hand</a>, you're a heartless bastard.

Survivor AI cannot use defibrillators or any bomb type items, but if a player who has the said items leaves the game, their bot will carry the items but cannot use them. Since the game does not allow dropping items or giving items to other players outside of pills/shots, you won't be able to take a bot's stuck items unless they get killed, where the items will then fall loose for anyone to pick up.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    MMORPG </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Can happen in this or any other MMORPG which uses guild vaults. Griefers will get themselves invited to a guild, convince their new guildmates to allow them to grab some gear out of the vault, and then leave the guild with their newfound stuff. Fortunately this activity is usually against the game's EULA and GMs can often help you recover your goods.
</li><li> This was a much more prevalent problem shortly after guild vault introduction to the game due to a coding glitch: whatever banking access privileges a character had with his previous guild were the defaults given back upon joining a new guild, meaning that a vault ransacking group could give maximum withdrawal permission to an accomplice who would then join other guilds and clean out their vaults and quit the guild within 5 minutes of joining. Needless to say this was rapidly patched.
</li><li> If members of a raiding guild can be considered party members, a not necessarily malicious case of this that resembles the traditional version of this trope can happen. Guilds might spend time gearing up a certain person who's crucial to progression, only for them to lose interest, encounter a real life issue, or go to a guild that's further along, taking all the gear they've looted with them. It can be frustrating to be passed over for a piece of gear in favor of someone who needs it more, only for them to leave soon after they they acquire it, which doesn't benefit you or your guild.
</li></ul></li><li> The above kind of behavior is NOT against the rules in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, and is a particularly infamous and widespread profession, making vetting new members and restricting access a lot more of a big deal. If your corporation gets swindled out of your items, tough luck, you should have been more careful about placing your trust in people. Your only option is to swear revenge.
</li><li> Though less severe than the others, players who choose to head up to Haven at an elevator in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights">Spiral Knights</a></em> will take with them their vitapods, potions, remedies, and health capsules if they don't drop them before getting on. If they leave mid-level, however, all of those items will drop where they stood and be up for grab.
</li><li> Happened in the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsOnline">The Sims Online</a></em>. When starting out, your Sim cannot afford a place on his/her own. So, you need to get a roommate. But, you have no idea who is trustworthy. This trope could certainly ensue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, when you lose your crew at the start of <em>Knights of the Fallen Empire</em>, they keep their gear. However, there's a button on the companion interface that lets you reclaim it. Oddly, if you wait until they're reintroduced naturally, their old gear magically reappears in your inventory shortly before they come back.

If, at any point, a hero left, all their items would be on the ground at the start of the next mission. The only exceptions were at the end of each campaign (obviously): if the items weren't there, that character was coming back.
</li><li> The only exception is if the Hero you can't use anymore was on a separate journey than the main hero of the campaign. For example, Grom Hellscream during his two missions in the Orc Campaign, Illidan during his own single mission in the Night Elf Campaign and any of Sylvanas' missions during the Frozen Throne Undead campaign. Anything they or any other heroes they met had is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently lost</a>.

This includes Tellah (twice), Yang (twice), Rosa, Edward, Rydia, Palom, Porom, and Fu So Ya - in other words, <em>every character in the game</em> except for Edge (the only character to never leave your party after he first joins). Even Cecil — yes, the game's <em>main character</em> — pulls this on himself when he class changes (though at least none of his old equipment is usable by anyone). Rosa is an especially bad offender, because when she returns she's lost all her armor and all you get to replace it is the second-weakest armor in the game - <em>right</em> before a big boss fight.

And even then, he comes with another set when he rejoins anyway for some reason.
</li><li> Shadow has a tendency to come and go throughout the first half of the game, the World of Balance. Better not give Shadow any rare equipment or Magicite until he joins for real in the World of Ruin.
</li><li> This trope can be averted, very oddly, by speaking to the equipment guy on the airship who will somehow unequip all of Shadow's stuff and give it to you even after he's gone.
</li><li> Due to a (minor to the point of being nearly unnoticeable, but entirely unavoidable) bug, inverted with just about the last character you'd expect: the boomerang and shield equipped by Kamog/Cosmog, one of the generic moogles at the beginning of the game, are "returned" to you at the end of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">World of Balance</span>. Note that you can't even alter Cosmog's equipment in the first place! (The reason for this is because this moogle shares his party member ID with Gogo, who hasn't been introduced yet, and the "unequip everyone" script accidentally counted Gogo among "everyone".)

Thank God the creators weren't cruel enough to take away all her materia, too... The fact that her equipment is not returned is especially irritating because there is a unique piece of armour (the Edincoat) in the dungeon just before you lose her that you will quite likely equip on her, since she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> who is, for that dungeon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredPartyMember">Required Party Member</a>. Luckily the weapon situation is no problem at all because Aerith is the only one that can equip staves in the first place, and there is one part in the last scene at the Temple of the Ancients where you can open the menu and de-equip Aerith of her gear just before she leaves.
</li><li> At various points in the game, Cloud, Tifa, and Yuffie are all temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and you lose their equipment as well, but you get their stuff back when they rejoin the group.
</li><li> Luckily this is avoided by the important stuff: the Materia. Whenever a party member leaves, they hand over their Materia beforehand. The one exception to this is in the optional Wutai quest where Yuffie leaves the party and takes all of your most valuable Materia (All of your Materia if she can carry it). This includes Materia that was equipped by other characters. However this is only temporary, and indeed the only way to progress in the game is to complete the sidequest to recover your materia. If you do the quest at the first chance and are underlevelled you might have some difficulty though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, don't forget to take back all the magic you gave to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Edea</a> unless you never want to see it again after Esthar. (Thankfully, Seifer's short stint in the party is mercifully spared this trope, as anything junctioned to him will magically appear on Selphie when she makes her first appearance later in the same mission.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>:
<ul><li> Occurs nearly every ten minutes. At least you get the gear back when the party members return, but that's small comfort when the fancy new super gear you blew all your cash on wanders off before you can use it. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing">Bag of Sharing</a> effect means that even when two of your party members decide to split off from the main group, they can use items in the shared inventory and even buy items for the other party members (who are now halfway across the continent) to equip later.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest Star Party Members</a> are an exception, however. You can remove Beatrix's armor when she fights alongside Steiner in Disk 3 (although there's no real reason, considering that you'll be able to buy it soon enough anyway), but when Marcus leaves the party after you escape from the Alexandria dungeon in Disk 2, his equipment is gone for good. This is particularly bad if he's got a Mythril Sword equipped, since you need that blade to be able to synthesize some of the very best armor in the game.
</li><li> The Mythril Sword loss is only a problem if the player doesn't think to visit Esto Gaza before going to the Desert Palace. However, you can give Beatrix one of the summoning items and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lose it for good</a>.

Each character's weapon and armor are unique to them and can't be unequipped. And except for a few very temporary instances, the characters who join your party are there for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>: The opening 15 or so hours feature several party switches. Anything equipped on (for example) Lightning and Hope when the switch to Sazh and Vanille happens <em>remains</em> on Lightning and Hope. This isn't so much of a problem for weapons, since each weapon type is only usable by one character, but it gets annoying in terms of accessories. This is at its worst during Chapter 7; it ends with a hard Boss Fight, so your instinct is to equip Fang, Lightning and Hope with the best stuff you have. Except, once that's done, the chapter ends and you switch over to Sazh and Vanille, who now have access to either the cast-off accessories with poor attributes/effects, or <em>absolutely nothing</em> (if you sold said cast-offs). Of course, you could just <em>buy</em> new accessories, but it's a waste of money when you consider <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the party comes together in the very next chapter</span> anyway...
</li><li> The <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em> games (actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG">SaGa</a></em> titles renamed for America) all feature temporary party members, but anything the player equips on them can't be removed.

For extra pain, the player is incredibly likely to have loaded him up with expensive magic tomes, since he can use them to change the element of his basic attack, and he leaves immediately after a boss fight he must be used in. Doubly frustrating if the boss in question drops an item and it ends up on him, meaning you don't even get to <em>look at it</em> before he vanishes. Although the trope can be inverted by taking equipment from the guests to use or sell.

This is also true of the Force Powers that you've taught her. They're replaced with average <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Side</span> powers. This will piss you off if you are playing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Side</span> and leveled her up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a>.

If on your second playthrough you give her all <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Side powers to help you immensely on the Star Forge with your evil character, she will majorly kick your ass in the mini-boss fight.</span>
</li><li> A related event: if you join the Dark Side, certain Light Side characters will choose to fight you. Once you know this ahead of time, you can make the fight very easy by confiscating all their stuff beforehand. Of course, the stuff wouldn't be lost because you could have just picked it up from them after you killed them. But it's fun watching them challenge you to the death while in their underwear.

</li><li> To a lesser extent, there's the fact that both games will occasionally throw you on a mandatory run with only one character, often not your main, and at the worst possible time. Good luck winning when all your good weapons are being used by active party members. The second game was <em>much</em> worse about this, particularly Nar Shaddaa, which had a good hour's worth of playtime spent doing nothing but forcing you to switch between numerous characters without so much as a chance to regroup.

<ul><li> This game avoids this trope with gear, but it still occurs. When the different characters are united after their individual story is over, any equipment that was in the bag when their chapter ended is still there. Their money, however, is lost. At least it's explained in-game: Maya gambled it all away, Alena hired some mercenaries, Ragnar spent it wandering the world, and Torneko paid for the construction of a ship.
</li><li> Also any temporary NPCs who join your party have their own personal equipment that cannot be removed and will refuse to accept any item you put into their inventory.
</li><li> Savvy players will go to the casino immediately prior to the end of chapters 2 and 3 and convert the remaining money into casino tokens, which are carried over to chapter 5. Unfortunately, casino tokens are in chapter 3 <em>much</em> more expensive than normal. Naturally, given that Torneko's store allows him to accumulate <em>vast</em> amounts of money if the player is patient enough.

You choose (with a couple exceptions in the second game) when to get rid of your guest party members, and thus have full control over what equipment they have at the time.

<ul><li> Both plays this trope straight and averts it — each character has their own personal inventory, so when someone leaves for a little while, it's very easy to lose an important item to them. However, whenever someone leaves for an extended period of time (or permanently), you are given a chance to retrieve any items that you wish to keep.

</li></ul></li><li> Some <em>Ultima</em> games avert this by having the character spontaneously drop everything, including clothes. Humorously, in <em>Serpent Isle</em> you pick up Selena, who is very transparently working for the bad guys and tries to lead you into a very ineffective and badly planned deathtrap. When the mercs she hired show up, she makes a remark about going back to the inn (she's not going to be there, though) and then teleports out of her clothes.

On occasion, they can be equipped with weapons, and a few can be treated outright like party members and equipped with both weapons and armor. For example, Red from Big Town, who you have to rescue from Super Mutants. The second these people have reach their destination, THE DIALOG OPTION TO TRADE ITEMS VANISHES. Then they'll just be walking around with the gear you gave them, totally unwilling to give it back. You can't even steal it without giving them better gear. The only solution is murder, which tarnishes your karma. Fortunately, it also works in reverse on occasion: Fawkes carries one of the most powerful melee weapons in the game in his inventory when you first meet him, and most players will take it (he'll equip a replacement). A temporary example occurs when you leave the Wasteland for a DLC area, you have to leave your companions behind, along with any gear they were carrying. Also, if a companion dies (which may happen due to a glitch when entering the Operation Anchorage simulation), the weapon and/or apparel they were equipped with may disappear.

</li><li> It's also possible to drive off Jaheira, though you have to mock her husband's death so you really have only yourself to blame.

You <em>can</em> buy some of the clothes again if you want them that desperately. Thankfully, the first time it happens, it's not too much of a loss: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">female equipment is useless to Neku and his other two partners after Shiki</span> unless you <em>really</em> powerlevel Bravery. And most of that first person's equipment is likely to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiki-specific</span>, anyway. The loss of the money stings a bit, though. Although once you finish the game and can visit any day, and also have the option of the alternate verse to run around in with any partner you choose, any clothing given to someone is easily recoverable at that point.
</li><li> Rather realistically inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiegeOfAvalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiegeOfAvalon">Siege of Avalon</a></em> anthology, where most party members have at least some equipment that cannot be unequipped, but can be taken from them if they die. (Naturally, you don't want the new kid taking the armor that's served you well for months of siege, even if he is the war hero's younger brother.) Unfortunately, it's mostly just standard mid-level armor with a distinct coloration (rare, but not unique) or even non-unique, non-enchanted, basic clothing, and it also means that you can't upgrade their armor at any point. And you'll want to. However, all but one of them will only die (permanently; every death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">is real</a>) if you're badly outnumbered and you don't or can't heal them in time to save them, or get a magician in your party and set him to do it for you.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox">Gold Box</a></em> series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> CRPGs</em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> who left the party would lose any equipment, weapons, armour, gold and even experience that they'd gained while with the party. Particularly notable in <em>Dark Queen of Krynn</em> where several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> would leave and rejoin the party at several stages, each time resetting to the same default stats and gear they started with.
</li><li> Notably, the effect is <em>instantaneous</em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox">Gold Box</a> games, as NPC inventory items <em>cannot</em> be traded to other characters.

Not stripping Taro of his item-gained specials before completing Akira's chapter means you lose some equipment for Cube later on. In fact, you only get to carry forward things the people yanked into the final chapter have on them; again, this matters mostly with Akira (you'll only be able to bring the robot equipment from his chapter to the final chapter for Cube if you equip him with all of it, even though it does nothing for him.) It's also a good idea to swipe all of Maddog's gear for the Sundown Kid in the Wild West Chapter as well, since all of it practically doubles the Kid's stats and he's the <em>only</em> character in the game who can use all the gear his partner carries.
</li><li> When someone dies in Interplay's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, you are instantly given the task of transferring inventory to another party member. If your inventory is already full, that stuff is gone. If the One Ring is gone, you're screwed, and the game ends.

</li><li> Averted by Ivan in the first game; he'll take his stuff with him, but Isaac and Garet can't equip it anyway, and he returns any Djinn you gave him. The latter is because he returns in a cut-scene that requires a power he can only use in his starting class, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">which will change if he has Djinn equipped</a>.

While he's gone, you don't fight any enemies, but there's one point where you need a special item to make a tightrope up to the top of a building. If Piers has the item, the man in the building lowers the rope, which is the <em>only</em> time in the game where the sprite for lowering a rope is used.

<ul><li> Occurs with Sveta. She joins your party at one point but then quickly leaves the party and doesn't rejoin until much later. If you happened to give her any of your best equipment or items, she'll take those with her. She also takes the Djinn she came with. Not that there's any reason to give her much. She comes equipped with the best vendors have to offer at that point, and she can't use anyone else's weapons. Her stats are good enough that it might actually be in your best interest to take <em>her</em> stuff and give it to weaker party members before she leaves.
</li><li> That said, if you take her claw/fist weaponry and sell them off to vendors because no one but Sveta can use them, then when she comes back, she won't have any weapons to fight with and you'll be stuck inside a major dungeon until you beat at least one and possibly two boss fights (there's a collectible claw in between, but it's easy to miss). This is a case where letting her keep her equipped gear as she leaves is actually worthwhile.

Hahn, Alys, Rune, Raja, and Seth can be un-equipped before they leave the party, and you can sell their stuff to help pay for better armor and weapons later on, but if you want to do that with Gryz, Demi, or Kyra, you have to be gutsy enough to go through a boss battle with them naked because they leave in the cutscenes following the victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2">SaGa Frontier 2</a></em> averts this by allowing you to access the inventories of characters not in your current party, and you can even equip techniques that they've learned (this is, in fact, how you can pick up a technique that would otherwise be permanently lost).

<ul><li> The game is pretty obvious with which party members will stay with you and which won't (hint: look for an approval bar), so it's easy to tell when you should strip your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">buddies</a> in the pre-initiation mission. It's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>, but hey. As a bonus, the usually dramatic initiation cutscene gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">added dose of hilarity</a>. However, even the "permanent" party members will leave if you cross their personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> — though if they decide to attack you first, you can then kill them and take your stuff back. Thanks to the game having equippable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> rewards from purchased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>, it's entirely possible for them to walk off with equipment you paid <em>real life money</em> for. Granted, you could get the armor in a new game, as the DLC quests stay once you've bought them, but it still feels like the game robbing you blind. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> makes note of it <a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/12/02/">in this strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> It's averted with the guys in the pre-initiation mission. Their stuff automatically goes into your inventory after the inevitable occurs. It is played annoyingly straight with the random guys you get in the Tower of Ishal.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels/6831-Stolen-Pixels-147-Naked-Greed">This "Stolen Pixels" strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> illustrates the reaction of players.
<div class="indent"><strong>The Warden:</strong> Any minute now I'll bump into a cutscene and they'll betray me, or run off, or die or whatever. So I figured I'd swipe their gear and sell it before that happens. <br/><strong><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jory</span>:</strong> You're saying you <em>sold our pants?!?</em> I'm freezing my ass off over here. <br/><strong><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daveth</span>:</strong> You don't think maybe there's a <em>reason</em> people run off and betray you?
</div></li><li> On the bright side, regarding the Tower of Ishal guys, if you just leave them in default gear you don't actually <em>lose</em> anything, and if you strip them you can get some bonus vendor trash as well as one of the only robes that'll be available for a while- normally trash too, but potentially useful if you're playing as a mage <em>and</em> plan to use Morrigan in your party early.
</li><li> If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alistair</span> leaves, he takes his stuff with him, and you've no option to get it back, nor can you attack him for leaving. If Zevran decides to leave, you actually can demand his equipment before he does in a dialogue option, but he'll refuse, stating he earned it for his service. You can still attack him though, and take it from his corpse.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Solas</span> leaves your party at the conclusion of the main storyline and takes all equipment he was wearing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaladinsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaladinsQuest">Paladin's Quest</a></em> can have this happen, but the worst example is the mercenary who will only join you when you buy her her full equipment set. Of course, if she leaves, you don't get the items back. Unless you use a tavern card. This item can be used at any point of the game and lets you rehire any mercenary. And the chick you bought equipment for will be with it and join you for free (when all other mercenaries cost the exact same amount of money they did the first time).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion">Albion</a></em> is nice enough to give you a chance to take equipment from the one character who leaves for plotline reasons. However, this is played straight if you neglect to take equipment off character who you fire to make more room in your party.
</li><li> Toyed with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcRiseFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcRiseFantasia">Arc Rise Fantasia</a></em>.
<ul><li> You can't equip or unequip <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">guest characters</a>, and characters who leave for an extended period leave their equipment and orbs behind.
</li><li> However, they keep their stuff if they're only gone for a little bit, and the game isn't very nice about warning you. One character, for example, gets booted in the cutscene preceding a boss fight — and this happens <em>twice in a row</em> with no warning.
</li><li> Finally, when playing as the alternate party, you <em>can</em> unequip them if you'd like, but they don't share the same item pool as your party... so there's no point.
</li></ul></li><li> Krobelus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Summoner2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Summoner2">Summoner 2</a></em>. Luckily he's not allowed any armour in the first place, but he has other equipment. Make sure you have a wooden staff in the inventory that you can replace his rod with, because you aren't allowed to just take his weapon.
</li><li> Can be done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games, although it generally has to be on purpose: by releasing a Pokémon holding an item. However, accidents are possible if, say, you actually raised that Shuckle in GSC and gave it a held item before returning it. Or traded that Spearow you were raising in FRLG for Farfetch'd on an impulse trade. Still not very likely, as useful items like the Master Ball or one-of-a-kind TMs have no reason to be given to your Pokémon in the first place, unless you're abusing the Pokémon/item duplication <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">glitch</a>, in which case this is a moot point. Alternately, though, people do sometimes trade items like Master Balls to friends by giving them to mons to hold during trade, and you can be screwed if you forget to remove said item before trading the mon yourself or trade it by mistake.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia">Grandia</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1">Grandia</a></em>, whenever a character permanently leaves the group, the player can find items in the storage area containing that character's weapon and magic experience. Also in the game, a different party member will leave and then return with a whole new set of equipment. The entire original set of equipment and accessories will be missing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII">Grandia II</a></em> one member of your party dies, which appears to be this trope when it comes to the coins spent on his abilities. However, the designers were nice enough to plan ahead, as there's an item that gives you all his Skill coins back.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens due to a programming oversight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> 3</em>. In previous games, story characters only leave for brief periods and come back with everything intact. (In fact, you can still view their equipment and stats in the menu while they're absent - they're merely locked in inactive slots.) And if you dismiss an optional party member, their equipment is returned to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing">Bag of Sharing</a>, but their EXP, stats, and hissatsu techniques are reset (if you recruit them back later), and any techs you taught them are gone. But in the third game, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Midorikawa, Fubuki, and later Kurimatsu</span> get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, the game treats these as dismissals and their techs are still reset if/when you get them back. Thankfully, this was fixed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>.
</li><li> Played straight with one character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a> II</em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Halfling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Halfling">halfling</a> you meet early in the game is locked up, and you have the option to free him. However, the first time you camp with him in the party, he runs off and takes, not the equipment he's carrying specifically, but <em>some of the gear of the sleeping party members</em>. Well, you should have expected it; he's a Thief (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">Character Class</a>). He even leaves a note invoking this trope by name.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondDivinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondDivinity">Beyond Divinity</a></em>, the Death Knight who has been your unwilling companion through the whole game turns out to be Damien himself and fights you. If he's got all of your good stuff, he can be nearly impossible to beat. If you remove all of his stuff just before the final boss fight right before the big reveal and manage to keep him alive, he's incredibly easy to beat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilIslands">Evil Islands</a></em>: Your companions do not transfer from one island to another, so make sure you've taken all the equipment from them before moving on. Also, since the last mission on an island yields the most XP, which is shared among the party, you might want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">ensure your companions do not survive the last mission at all</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em>, there are numerous instances where you switch between different groups of party members. Whenever you do, the party members that are left behind keep whatever equipment they have for the time being and you don't get it back until they rejoin. Not a problem with weapons, since each character has their own unique type, but definitely potentially troublesome with accessories and armor. Particularly egregious if you choose to Crescendo and Serenade for the final boss battle of Lament Mirror in the PS3 version, since you don't get them back for two chapters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And don't even think about equipping anything good to Claves, who <em>dies</em> at the end of Chapter 3, though she can rejoin, and eventually fully resurrected, if you visit Mysterious Unison in Chapter 7, at which point you can finally get back anything that was equipped.</span>
</li><li> Averted in both <em>Silva Saga</em> games. Before a character leaves the party, he/she passes off both current equipment <strong>and</strong> approximate stats to the character who's about to join you. Plot relevance aside, the next character is identical to the one you used to have.
</li><li> Defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a>: Hordes of the Underdark</em> — the "Pool of Lost Souls" contains the equipment of henchmen who have left your party. You can retrieve any items you need for a nominal fee.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen">The Denpa Men</a></em>; when Denpa Men die in the overworld (or if you decide to send them away to free up space in your reserves), all their gear is returned to your inventory. Thankfully, this applies to Denpa Men acquired via QR Code, who can't be revived from overworld deaths or retrieved if deliberately sent away.
</li><li> Usually averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVeryLongRopeToTheTopOfTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVeryLongRopeToTheTopOfTheSky">A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky</a></em>. Though your party is often in flux, party members who leave will always have their equipment dumped back in your inventory. (This actually gets a little weird when you still retain Mothcutter after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rutger</span> leaves the party, despite it being described as his personal weapon.) There are two exceptions: At one point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ivy</span> leaves the party for one dungeon and keeps their equipment on them (this is necessary, as they rejoin in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a>), and everyone retains their equipment when the party splits up in the Silver Spring prison. (The last one can actually be a problem, since it can leave certain party members crippled against their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Bosses</a>.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>, the Chaos Hero will at one point decide that he needs more power in order to defeat a boss, and wants to fuse himself with a demon to do so. The next time you're at the Jakyou Manor, he'll automatically pick the highest-level demon you have (thus usually your most powerful and necessary one) and use that one. And while he does get a fair bit more powerful from this, after the boss fight he'll decide that you're weak and "only holding him back", and leaves the party forever.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, one of your party members leaves for a large chunk of the story, taking whatever they have on with them. Once they come back, they're sporting entirely new equipment. Though as they leave in the first hour or two of the game, the gear you lose isn't that valuable.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>. Although one of your party members leaves for good, completing Doug's final Heart-to-Heart conversation after beating the game will reward you with their gear.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>. Only thrice do characters leave the party. The first and third time, the characters return before you really have a chance to miss anything they were equipped with. The second time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vandham's equipment is returned to you on his death, and Roc will retain whatever core and AUX chips he was using when Rex resonates with him.</span>
</li><li> In the old DOS rpg <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Karma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Karma">Karma</a></em>, the numerous NPCs you can recruit have a nasty habit of leaving your party at random moments, along with whatever expensive equipment you've bought them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeRedemption">Vampire: The Masquerade  Redemption</a></em>, this is averted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Erik</span> is forcibly removed from your party, as they drop all their stuff beforehand. However, played straight when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink</span> unexpectedly leaves your party.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodnet">BloodNet</a></em>—all the characters booted from your party leave all their stuff lying on the ground in one big pile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> series:

However there's only two things she can be equipped with that aren't unique to her, her armour and her game disc, both of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness">early-game junk</a> anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegadimensionNeptuniaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegadimensionNeptuniaVII">Megadimension Neptunia VII</a></em> has a very fluid party that changes completely between chapters. You lose Neptune's stuff when she leaves in Z Dimension chapter, but she takes it with her to a solo interlude. Big Nep's inventory is inaccessible for most of the G Dimension chapters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since she's working for the villains</span>. And the fours CPUs take their gear with them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while they're brainwashed</span>, which is brief but can suck if you blew your budget on the new gear available before switching to a completely different party with no warning.

The Falsebound Kingdom</a></em> averts this- whenever a character is temporarily out of the party (or, in the case of Marthis in the Kaiba campaign, permanently so), it's possible to reassign their monsters and equipment to other characters. (However, the compatibility ball mechanic means that those monsters will probably not be as effective on the new character until they've been used on that team for a while.)

In <em>Madden 25</em>, players would earn XP each week you sent them into practice mode. That XP could be used on traits which would provide an immediate bonus, or to invest in a player long-term by using extremely expensive development upgrades. This, of course, deferred their on-field improvement until later. However, the game also included a mechanic whereby players could become so "insulted" by your contract offer (even if it was exactly what they asked for!) that they flatly refuse to sign with you and take all your expensive development to another team.

<ul><li> The game would give you AI partners if you were playing alone, who were notorious for occasionally taking extremely valuable items or ammo and running off to die. You could take the items off the bodies, but generally the same monsters which killed them would kill you.
</li><li> This could happen online as well, if someone took an important item and then went AFK for a long time, thus never able to respond to any requests for that item. If this happens in a safe area, one of the other players would have to get killed elsewhere and come back as a zombie to kill the idle player, but that wouldn't work for a two-player run or an area devoid of remaining enemies and hazards. By the time the idler's virus gauge is maxed out naturally, everyone else is likely also dead or close to it.
</li><li> Amusingly, in <em>Outbreak</em>, you could loot a dead character's body if you were in the same room, even if they were totally inaccessible because they happened to be <em>inside a zombie shark</em> at the time.

<ul><li> Normally, losing a character would mean completely losing their inventory. More often than not, most player would rather reset the entire chapter than lose a valuable item (or unit). Since <em>Shadow Dragon</em>, any items that were in a fallen ally will automatically be transferred into the convoy.
</li><li> Certain chapters have NPC allies, who are hated by players as occasionally they will kill an enemy that can drop a valuable or useful item, and if an NPC does this then that item is lost to you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orson</span> betrays you and take any items that he had with you. Not that it really hurts you too much since he's only in one chapter outside of the main story. However, it can easily can be averted once you know that it's coming and make him a meatshield.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>, though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinon and Gatrie</span> leaves the party, any items they had are automatically dropped in the convoy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>, you play chapters where some characters might not be with you, causing some items to be temporarily lost as you switch between one party to another. In addition, you'll sometimes fight characters you used to control (and will again in the future), and the CPU loves to break your rare weapons during these periods.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>: Depending on your choices during the Black Eagles route, this is played both ways. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Normally, when Edelgard and Hubert make their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, they leave your party and you have to get their stuff off them before they leave. However, if you choose to have your army follow their lead, <em>Flayn</em> will leave.</span> This is also significant because you can potentially have your chosen <em>Dancer</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever">Lost Forever</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2860r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2860r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2860r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">About two-fifths into the game, there is an in-game dance competition. You can enter <em>one</em> character, who, if they win, gains the ability to use the Dancer class — an exceedingly useful class that uses white and black magic, and can give other characters an extra turn in combat. Only <em>this</em> one character will ever be able to access the Dancer class, though, so if this character leaves or dies, well...</span> if you don't see this coming.
</li></ul></li><li> Cecille from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em> manages to pull this without leaving the party. She has a particularly unusual class change, which ends up changing all of her equipment except accessories, removing whatever she had equipped before from the game. If, as is quite likely, you had her equipped with the Tiara — a special headgear that prevents all status effects, equippable only by a very limited number of characters — you're out of luck, as there's only one per playthrough.
</li><li> Semi-averted and played straight at the same time with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</a></em>.
<ul><li> When you start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, all of the equipment you had on the characters you had acquired through the story are lost until you get them back in their respective storylines, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that you technically haven't met them yet.
</li><li> Then there's the part in one of the later chapters where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jennifer</span> leaves the team <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(and gets subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> by Kurtis)</span> — you lose any equipment you had on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kurtis does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">and commits his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>, bringing her back to the team (equipment intact, thankfully).
</li><li> Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Flonne</a> </span>is taken out of commission for the final boss fight via <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting turned into a flower</span>. She'll come back with her stuff on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, of course, but the stuff on her, which is likely to be good stuff, since she's one of the best story characters in the game, is locked away from you until then.
</li><li> After beating the aforementioned final boss, if you choose to start in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideanotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideanotherStory">Etna Mode</a> instead of a traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laharl will die in the opening cutscene</span>, leaving you without <em>his</em> equipment, as well. Etna Mode is significantly more difficult than the normal story, and you probably <em>needed</em> him fully equipped to handle the final boss without access to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flonne</span>, making it nothing short of annoying.
</li></ul></li><li> Every single team member in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium">Odium</a></em>, since they all leave without warning. Especially ridiculous when one of your teammates departs through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dying an unavoidable death on the street. You'd think you could just collect the stuff off the teammate's corpse, but no dice</span>.
</li><li> Averted quite nicely in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em> series: mercs whose contract is up will leave behind their equipment. In fact, one of the strategies in <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em> involves creating an IMP merc (widely considered to be your chance to make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>, and will stay on the party permanently), hiring one of the super-expensive mercs for one day with their equipment, taking the first two towns, and then—when the AIM merc's contract is up—equipping his assault rifle and expensive gear on your IMP merc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000ChaosGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000ChaosGate">Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate</a></em> has this on one level. Enemies will teleport in, grab a random team member and then whisk him away, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">never to be seen again</a>. Hope you didn't have any rare/unique wargear on him
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series tends to do this, especially with storyline deaths. A very early one occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars3">Super Robot Wars 3</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Reccoa</a> disappears to go spy on the bad guys and takes the Mobile Suit you put her in with you. Here's hoping you shoved her into a mook unit before hand and not one of your special Gundams.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a> 3</em>: if you chose to start with Touya's route, you get to play out the beginning of the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em>. Sadly, because of this, when GaoGaiGar gets wrecked, it (and Guy) go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> and all of GaoGaiGar's upgrades are rendered moot.
</li><li> Mostly averted in most modern games though. If a unit is lost permanently any money you spent upgrading it will be refunded. However pilot points aren't, so if you gave one of the few pilots to leave forever lots of kills to gain pilot points... well you just wasted your time and deprived pilots who you keep permanently of them. Not to mention you don't get refunded for units that are simply inaccessible for awhile but eventually come back, even if "awhile" is upwards of 20 stages and they only return shortly before the finale. Woe to the player who invested heavily in Akito in <em>W</em>, only for the Prince of Darkness plot to kick in and make him unavailable for almost the second half of the game, or one who upgraded units in the first <em>Z</em> game that wouldn't be with them for the middle route where the teams are split up for 20 stages. Hope you can make do without them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits">Vanguard Bandits</a></em>, there are several characters who leave the party<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hkl5');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hkl5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hkl5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ione and Galvas in the Kingdom branch, Cecilia in the Empire-Sadira branch, and Devlin, Zeira, and Galvas in the Ruin branch</span>, and will take whatever equipment they have and whatever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">ATAC</a> they're piloting with them. There's no way to remove equipment or ATACs from a character, so all you can do is make sure that they don't have anything that you're going to miss. Any EXP they gained will be wasted as well, and since you cannot grind and there is only a limited number of enemies in the game, this has the potential to mess you up if you let one of these characters soak up too many kills.
