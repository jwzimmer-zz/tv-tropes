</li><li> They push their luck too many times and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">karma finally decides to step in</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>, the protagonists swap Kanade "Angel" Tachibana's test sheets with their own faked sheets in order to cause her to fail her exams and get removed from her position as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, and not only succeed, but get away with it. Several episodes later, Otonashi, having befriended Kanade, comes clean about the entire thing, resulting in her being reinstated as president and him and his accomplices being punished.
</li><li> The Baron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BelladonnaOfSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BelladonnaOfSadness">Belladonna of Sadness</a></em> has Jeanne gang raped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroitDuSeigneur">Droit du Seigneur</a> when she and her husband, Jean, can't pay an absurdly high marriage tax, chops off Jean's hand when he can't pay more taxes, and finally has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burned at the stake</a>, and is unpunished when the movie ends and the rest of the village is cowed into submission to the Baron. Of course, her actions are heavily implied to kickstart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, and the Baron will most likely a meet a bloody but fitting end.
</li><li> Fumito Nanahara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">Blood-C</a></em> gets away after committing a lot of atrocities which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a> Saya by hiring actors to play as her friends and getting these people brutally killed just to for his experiment. The movie also revealed that he turns people into Elder Bairns which includes Mana's dad. However, it's revealed that he did this out of his love to her and that all of these were just for Saya's survival and to restore her ability to feed on humans. All of his experiments failed which led to Fumito to turn himself into an Elder Bairn as a last resort so he could be with Saya. But he knows that she would kill him for ruining her life. So in the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">he lets himself get stabbed by Saya's sword</a> knowing that he would never be with the woman that he loved and that he failed his mission to keep her alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: After having killed his rival L and getting away with the murder of innocent people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Light finally meets his fate</a> in the final episode. He definitely shouldn't have gloated without double-checking that he'd accomplished his victory conditions, and within earshot of an armed investigator.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Because <em>Bardock: The Father of Goku</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> are prequels to <em>Dragon Ball</em>, Frieza gets away with killing almost all the Saiyans and laughs happily as Planet Vegeta explodes. Bardock's final vision in the TV Special, however, is one of Goku fighting Frieza on Namek. So despite everything, Bardock dies knowing that his son will avenge him. Even in <em>Minus</em>, we see a panel of Goku and Frieza facing each other as the final shot. Indeed, Frieza's downfall comes about as a result of his own actions; for starters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">his attempt to prevent a Super Saiyan from coming into being end up bringing one forth</a> when he pushes Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">too far</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, because of the nature of <em>The History of Trunks</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> counterparts of Androids 17 and 18 are never made to pay for their crimes; when Trunks tries to avenge Gohan's death at their hands, he's nearly killed. They <em>finally</em> get their just desserts three years later when Trunks, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken a level in badass</a> thanks to his training in the past, returns and dishes out to them exactly what they did to Gohan: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">making them feel completely powerless and outmatched before killing them</a>.
</li><li> While he's friendlier and less evil than Frieza, Cell, or Buu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">Beerus</a> still gets away with some unpleasant actions: he cruelly used King Vegeta's head as a footstool in front of his own son Prince Vegeta while making him treat him to an Eight-Course Banquet, knowing that he was much weaker than him and with no possibility of defense, and has been responsible for numerous genocides throughout the universe. He is also ready to destroy Earth over not getting pudding. His initial behavior in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, such as destroying entire planets after eating all their food, is also quite heinous, but he still gets away with it. In the Universe Survival Saga, his handling as God of Destruction comes back to bite him when it was revealed that Universe 7 is one of the universes about to be destroyed by Zeno because it has the second lowest mortal rating of all 12 universes; the only reason his universe has a chance to be spared was thanks to Goku's proposal for the multiversal tournament. As a result, Shin calls him out for his sleeping habits and Goku called him out for his random destruction of planets. Not much of a punishment, but with an author-favored character one takes what one gets.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoking this trope</a> is a core part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Roy Mustang's</a> motivation. As a soldier in a past civil war, Mustang and his fellow soldiers committed many horrible atrocities, however, because they were on the winning side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">they were all commended and treated as war heroes.</a> Mustang's goal throughout the series is to become the Führer of the country, so that he can ensure that this is rectified. When his subordinate (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>) points out that this means Mustang will most likely be tried as a war criminal himself and sent off to prison, Mustang informs her that that's <em>exactly</em> what he wants. We never see it occur, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that he does indeed see his day in court, and is found guilty and then pardoned, mostly for saving everyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, Haman Karn, Neo-Zeon's leader who wants to restore Zeon to its former glory, outlives Paptimus Scirocco and the Titans and personally defeats Char Aznable while the AEUG is in shambles which makes her as the only threat standing against the Earth Sphere.

These actions include the awakening of the relic mobile armor Hashmal, which then rampages around Mars for a while before being destroyed and getting tons of innocent people killed, then orchestrates the death of Naze Turbine and his wife Amida Arca—who are both mentor figures and close friends of the main protagonists in Tekkaden—for using an illegal weapon to destroy Hashmal by using those same illegal weapons, which also leads to the murder of another friend and ally of Tekkaden.

Akihiro happens to have been particularly affected by Iok's actions and gets a second wind which allows him to kill Iok in a particularly brutal way.

When he <em>does</em> return, he is implied to have gained some remorse over his past actions (not that he's going to admit it), so he goes out of his way to save Koyomi from a Snake God-influenced Nadeko and convince her to move on from her obsession with him, even if he has little to gain, or without the direct involvement of Kanbaru, the only person in town he has ever shown kindness to. And all it got him was a potentially fatal wound from one of the boys he scammed in the past.

They continue to get away with it until Queen Mirelia returns from aboard and immediately puts her foot down. The backlash of their actions is so great that it had to be contained in a mini-arc.

He helps his guildmates scam people out of their weapons and sell them so that they can keep pace with the rest of the "clearers," since they'd fallen behind while trying to help Nezha (who's essentially legally blind in-game as a result of a Full-Dive Nonconformity).

As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Vince Gilligan</a> himself stated, he believes that at some point everyone will have to face the terrible consequences of their evil deeds, no matter how long it takes. This is why at the end of the series several of the drug dealers are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">dead</a> (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Walter White</a> himself) or, if left alive, either had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">nothing to look forward to</a> (such as Saul) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">bore the stigma of guilt</a> (such as Jesse).

For the first half of the first season, it seemed like the Kettlemans would invert this trope, but thinking about it, they were never gonna get away with it to begin with. They just wanted the dignity of not caving in and confessing their involvement. Plus, they thought that no matter what happened, as long as they kept the money, they'd win. Ultimately, thanks to Mike, that plan soon became moot.

She's finally demoted and eventually fired when she finally has the guts and decency to admit to her fault in hiring a mentally unstable physician and ignoring repeated complaints about the man's erratic and violent behavior.
</li><li> This is a major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo">Fargo</a></em>, as characters who engage in crimes ranging from murder to petty blackmail often end up dead by the series' end.

All of the Gerhardts are dead by the end of the season, Ed Blumquist is also dead, and Peggy is arrested. Mike Milligan survives and undergoes a promotion under Kansas City, but it's far from what he'd had in mind, and the entire organization undergoes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> offscreen before the events of season one. Hanzee Dent also subverts this trope when he adopts a new name and cleans himself from any involvement in the Sioux Falls massacre, only for his new identity to be revealed as one of a mobster who was taken out by Lorne Malvo in the first season.
</li><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonThree">season three</a>: Nikki Swango escapes authorities and goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against Narwhal.

<ul><li> This happen to Jaime Lannister early on in Season 3. After two full seasons of getting away with stuff like trying to kill a child who discovered him committing incest with his twin sister and actually killing his own cousin for momentary advantage, he got off pretty lightly as a relatively well-treated prisoner of war who was to be returned home as part of a hostage exchange. In fact, one of the first genuinely kind and (almost) selfless things he's ever shown doing is intervening to prevent Brienne from being raped when it becomes apparent she's too outnumbered by attackers to defend herself for long. And it works... but their captors take umbrage at Jaime's superior attitude in doing so, and cut off his sword hand in what basically amounts to an act of senseless spite.

His warranty expires after Jon's promotion to Lord Commander in Season 5, when he makes the fatal mistake of assuming he can get away with defying the new Lord Commander's authority without reprisal. He gets a death sentence for his insubordination, causing him to degenerate in his last moments to a pathetic blubbering mess that Jon kills as much out of disgust as out of duty.
</li><li> Roose Bolton manages to get away with the Red Wedding in Season 3 and the conquest of Moat Cailin in Season 4. He also manages to repel the army of Stannis Baratheon in Season 5 without suffering any particular losses. He finally meets his end thanks to his only decent act shown onscreen: wanting to protect Walda and their newborn son.

Then, he continues being a murdering asshole much to the viewers annoyance. Unfortunately for Ramsey, his time is up in the penultimate episode of Season 6, when his forces are overrun by the combined forces of Stark loyalists, the Wildings and Knights of the Vale and Jon Snow cornered him at Winterfell and beat him up into a bloody pulp. To add the cherry on top, Sansa finally got back at him for his horrible actions by having him fed to his own dogs.

His first act of treachery happened before the show even began; the murder of Jon Arryn, Hand of the King. He then betrays the next Hand, Ned Stark, to the Lannisters usurping the throne. He then has a hand in the assassination of King Joffrey, and then personally murders Jon Arryn's widow Lysa, whom he was plotting and consorting with. Then he sells his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy">Bastard Understudy</a>, Sansa Stark, to a previously mentioned Karma Houdini family (whose warranty also ran out): the Boltons.

Then in the Season 6 premiere, they proceed to murder Oberyn's brother and nephew and take over Dorne before disappearing in the story until the Season 6 finale where they form an alliance with Olenna Tyrell and Daenerys Targaryen. Their warranty expires in Season 7 when Euron Greyjoy kills two of the Sand Snakes and captures Ellaria and Tyene Sand so they can be deliver to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">the vengeful Cersei Lannister</a>, who wants them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">to pay for Myrcella's death</a>. Cersei gives them a crueler punishment which is to force Ellaria to watch her own daughter die of the same poison that killed Myrcella while in chains and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">to spend the rest of her life seeing her daughter's corpse rot</a>.
</li><li> Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane is the strongest knight of the Seven Kingdoms who committed a lot of atrocities during the Sack of King's Landing such as raping and killing Elia Martell and her children and is responsible for burning half of Sandor's face. He also brutally kills Elia's younger brother, Oberyn, while smugly admitting his past crimes. Though Oberyn's poison renders him comatose, he comes backs as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> who becomes Cersei's loyal and powerful bodyguard.

She even gets both Maergery and Loras Tyrell lock up by the Faith Militant; though she too get arrested by the Faith Militant and forced to do the walk of shame. However, she manages to get away with it and is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms after burning the Sept of Baelor which killed the Tyrells and the Faith Militant. In Season 7, she dismantles Daenerys' Dornish and Reach allies and refuses to aid her and Jon Snow in their fight against the White Walkers. Despite sitting out in the first half of the final season, her warranty expires after she had Euron Greyjoy kill one of Daenerys' dragons and has Missandei executed in front of Daenerys. This culminates Daenerys to unleash her fury by destroying the Golden Company and Lannister army, slaughtering the civilians and burning down much of King's Landing and the Red Keep.

After being tricked by Peg into having sex with her for nine months in order to conceive another child and get a $500,000 inheritance, Al learns that she's been taking birth control pills to keep from getting pregnant.

By chance a woman meets the son of a man who, 40 years ago while working as a mercenary in Africa, committed a war crime in the village where she was volunteering as a teacher. To get some revenge for his atrocity which left several of her students dead, she blackmails him to donate a million pounds to a charity dedicated to repairing the damage men like him caused. He knew she was a nun and attempted to murder her but killed one of her convent sisters instead because they both wore glasses. This led to the police getting involved and his being arrested.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em> begins with an uneducated lowlife (the eponymous Earl) winning a modest amount of money off a scratch ticket, only to have an unfortunate encounter with the front end of an old woman's Cadillac. To add insult to injury, his wife comes by to see him in the hospital...and serves him divorce papers while he's all doped up on morphine so that she can get married to a mutual friend she'd been cheating on him with for <em>years</em>. He turns on the TV in the hospital, and sees Carson Daly interviewing someone, who attributes their good fortune to (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">Theme Park Version</a> of) karma. It occurs to Earl that possibly, the reason he's in this mess, and the reason things hadn't ever <em>really</em> gone his way in general, is that he's spent the past 35 years of his life doing bad things: stealing, bullying, mistreating women, getting drunk and acting like an idiot, and not making any effort to better himself in any way. He starts to worry that if he continues on the path he's been on, he'll probably end up dead (and even says as much to Kenny). So he makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListOfTransgressions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListOfTransgressions">a list of everything wrong he can remember doing in his life</a> (and adds to it when something comes up that he didn't remember, or that was an indirect consequence of something on the list). And he tries to make up for each one.
<ul><li> In one episode, Earl makes up for stealing a fast-food worker's honeymoon fund, by sitting in for him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool">at work</a> while he's on his delayed honeymoon. The fast-food worker has a <em>terrible</em> boss; he pays his workers abysmally, embezzles money from the restaurant, is cheating on his wife, writes a rude note and doesn't leave any relevant information when he accidentally dents someone else's car in the parking lot, and treats his employees like crap. Earl can't figure out why a guy like that has such a great life; he has a hot wife, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>, a nice car, lots of friends, and even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus">Biggus Dickus</a>. Earl resists the temptation to punch him, like he had done with all his previous bosses, but eventually his insults just get to be too much. The punch is hard enough to land Mr. Patrick in the emergency room, which kicks off a chain reaction of events: his wife and his mistress both rush to the ER and find out about each other, his wife destroys all his "world's best whatever" mugs in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefenestrateAndBerate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefenestrateAndBerate">Defenestrate and Berate</a>, she finds the money he was stealing and turns him in to law enforcement, and she files for divorce and gets the restaurant in the divorce settlement, while Mr. Patrick is sent to prison (and apparently becomes his cellmate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">prison bitch</a>, complete with a dented tin mug with "World's Best Bottom" scrawled on it). His ex-wife promotes the worker that Earl subbed for to manager, and he gives everyone raises and benefits (like health and dental insurance).
</li></ul></li><li> The Series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks">New Tricks</a></em> is essentially built around a gang of retired detectives trying to track down Karma Houdinis and invalidate their warranties. The best example of the series is probably Ricky Hanson; the closest thing the series has to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. After killing the wife of one of the main characters, his own brother, and countless victims in between, he is brought to trial in the first episode of season 5. Tragically, following a furious mudslinging match against the thoroughly discredited witnesses, some glaringly obvious jury tampering, and possibly a bit of muckraking from an insider (thus explaining how his lawyer knew so much about the UCOS team), he walks away Scott free and takes immense delight in cruelly rubbing Jack's face in it. Fortunately, he comes back into the picture in the season 6 episode "The Last Laugh" and is finally nailed, not just for the murder the team were investigating at the time, but also for several other crimes he had committed (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">incest</a>). The episode ends with the team breaking out the champagne and Jack sitting by his wife's grave assuring her "we got 'im!".

It's implied he was poisoned by ex-slave John Bell, whom he'd maimed earlier in the episode.

Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">minor culprits</a> have committed heinous crimes in the past, often including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime">one crime</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase">no one has solved</a>, and gotten away with it for <em>years</em>. Naturally, <em>you</em> are the one who finally uncovers their misdeeds and sends them to their long-deserved comeuppance. Examples include:
<ul><li> Miles Edgeworth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Phoenix Wright's main opponent in the first game</a>, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a> prosecutor who does whatever it takes to win, including coaching witnesses and concealing (but not forging) evidence. After losing two cases to Phoenix, he starts to realize that the defendant isn't automatically guilty and reconsiders his ways. Immediately afterward, he is framed for murder (and has to relive his guilt over the death of his father in the ensuing trial), the police chief tries something similar, rumors fly about all his dirty dealings, and he learns — to his horror — that he won the case that made his name using forged evidence. All of the above is probably justified, since the Ace Attorney courts are a crooked system. They liked Edgeworth as a man who would go for a conviction and ask no questions; when he started honestly pursuing the truth he became a threat. Fortunately, with Phoenix's help, he rises above it all and becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist">Internal Reformist</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Redd White</a> uses his company, Bluecorp, to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">blackmail</a> material on people so he can control them. For years, he built himself up with this business model, even driving some people to suicide. When Mia Fey comes close to exposing him, he murders her and tries to pin it on Maya and Phoenix — by the end of the case, his luck has run out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">thanks in no small part to Mia herself</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Manfred von Karma</a>, Miles Edgeworth's mentor and the most feared prosecutor in the world, has a near-perfect record which he got by manipulating trials so he always won, regardless of how many innocent people were put away. When Gregory Edgeworth gave him his one black mark, he killed him and adopted his son to psychologically abuse him in revenge. But Phoenix exposes his role in the plot to frame Miles <em>and</em> the murder of Gregory, putting an end to Manfred's career of evil.
</li><li> Damon Gant, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">corrupt police chief</a>, killed Neil Marshall and forged evidence so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreeKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreeKiller">Spree Killer</a> Joe Darke would take the fall. He also manipulated the scene to make Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye think her sister Ema did it, giving him control over the entire Prosector's Office. And he got away with it for years... until Phoenix.
</li><li> In <em>Justice For All</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor">Matt Engarde</a> deliberately drove his girlfriend Celeste to suicide just to spite his rival Juan Corrida. When Juan finally found out and set out to expose his secret, Matt paid an assassin to silence him, then used that same assassin to force Phoenix to acquit him. Needless to say, Phoenix ultimately turns the situation around on him, exposes all his crimes, and leaves him begging for prison so that the assassin won't come after <em>him</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Trials And Tribulations</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Dahlia Hawthorne</a> murdered her step-sister Valerie and blamed it on her boyfriend Terry, who killed himself on her request. In the flashback fourth case, she gets away, but in the first case, which takes place sometime after, she commits another murder and blames it on Phoenix, only for Mia (who was also the defense attorney for Terry) to finally prove her guilt and make sure she did not get away this time. She tries to get revenge as a spirit later, but that plan gets foiled as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</a></em>, just about all the members of the smuggling ring have been getting away with it for years, especially the boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">Ambassador Quercus Alba</a> (who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a>), and his spy, Calisto Yew (who was confronted by Edgeworth in the flashbacks fourth case but escaped). But Edgeworth is able to put them away, finally nabbing Alba and Yew in the final chapter.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">the second Investigations game</a>, this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a> Simon Keyes, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">sets in motion the events of the game</a> to punish the people who made his life miserable and got away with it, each of whom is a culprit in the game; from his father Dane Gustavia having murdered his partner, the case that became the DL-6 incident where Gregory was murdered, to Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland, two prominent conspirators in the plot to unseat/kill President Di-Jun Huang and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">replace him</a> with his body double. The imposter himself, however, is simply murdered by Simon.
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, Kristoph Gavin was the one responsible for disbarring Phoenix Wright and ushering in the Dark Age of the Law, where legal corruption runs rampant. But Phoenix himself implements a plan that ultimately gets Kristoph's corruption exposed, and arrested for two murders he was responsible for.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Dual Destinies</a></em>, the phantom, the sociopathic spy, killed Detective Bobby Fulbright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">to impersonate him</a>, killed Metis Cykes and got the innocent Simon Blackwill framed for it, and helped create the Dark Age fo the Law. But in the final case, thanks party to the efforts of Metis's daughter Athena, and Simon himself, the phantom is revealed in front of everyone as being a fake Fulbright, and he is finally arrested.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Spirit of Justice</a></em>, Queen Ga'ran used trickery to usurp the throne from her sister and blame Dhurke for the crimes Ga'ran herself committed, slowly transforming Khurain into a dictatorship where defense attorneys are punished alongside their clients and any threat to her power is destroyed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>. But Apollo and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Defiant Dragons</a> manage to slowly whittle away at her co-conspirators, until Apollo finally proves she has no legitimate claim to the throne, rendering all her draconic laws null and void.

<ul><li> The titular Dominic from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a></em> alledgedly getting away with far too many morally questionable acts despite supposedly being an unquestionable hero, is a big reason for the comic's large snark and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">HateDoms</a>. Then comes the end of the <em>Snowsong</em> arc and he finally gets some punishment for his more questionable actions when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Nurse Pam</a> forces him to do community servive as the town's resident seer. A job Dominic loathes beyond measure.
</li><li> Textbook case: Fox Maharassa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FriendlyHostility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FriendlyHostility">Friendly Hostility</a></em>. A flirt and a danger magnet with little empathy, Fox got away with quite a lot. But the "transgressions" that actually landed his relationship with Collin in serious trouble and, if you follow the sequel comic, ultimately led to their breakup, weren't really his fault. It involved Arath dripping poison in Collin's ear (incorrectly accusing Fox of cruelty and cheating when not only did Arath have no proof, he didn't know Fox to any extent at all), being stuck in a catch-22 with Collin (Collin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKnowWhatYouDid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKnowWhatYouDid">flatly refusing to explain why Fox was in the doghouse</a> and playing the "guess what you did wrong" game), and even having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">goalposts moved</a> on him when he took drastic measures to rescue their relationship. In short, Fox went from a lovable rogue to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>.
<ul><li> Collin himself suffered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Always a Bigger Fish</a> version of this trope when he encountered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> Leslie Rudd. Collin was always obnoxious, but in the one case he had every right to be annoyed - Rudd having sent Collin's boyfriend into serious danger - he got smacked down by the one character with no right to criticise. Oddly, while Fox suffered a backlash from the fandom (and perhaps, the creator) when his Karma Houdini Warranty expired, Rudd was universally adored...and as he adhered strictly to the terms of his warranty, got a happy ending.
</li><li> While the Warranty certainly expired as a result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a>, blaming the breakup on Arath is hardly fair. Collin ignored his gossip for years before finally agreeing with him, and when he did, it was because of an accumulated bitterness over Fox' past antics and the fact that he was failing at the guessing game, combined with breaking the isolation he'd had from the rest of the world.

When that time comes he won't think, "that good triumphed over evil." he'll think,"that he got to live like a god for three decades! Sure the last ten minutes sucked but you can't have everything." He then goes on to say that the story told about his defeat will inspire more villains because,"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Audiences always think the villain is cooler than the hero is, anyway</a>." Karma, when confronted by this, apparently decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">jump the tracks completely</a> and pitted him against a son that refused to follow any tale he was familiar with, at which point it all starts to catch up. And rather than dying in a climactic battle like he wanted, he winds up getting abandoned in the desert by the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">so he can live with the knowledge that he wasn't an important enough villain for them to deal with</a>.

She and Redcorn mutually (though reluctantly) agree to part ways in season 4. However, there were some who felt that both Nancy and Redcorn got off too easily. At least until later episodes had them face consequences for their adultery:
<ul><li> "Night and Deity" has a gorgeous female exterminator fall in love with Dale, and Nancy is powerless to stop it without sounding like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrite</a> or possibly revealing her own unfaithful behavior. Dale, (un)fortunately, never even considers cheating on Nancy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">which shows that he's a far better person than she is</a>.
</li><li> "Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow" has Nancy starting to undergo female pattern baldness, and the stress that Dale's antic put on her is making her hair fall out even faster. Redcorn also tries to get back together with Nancy in this episode, which stresses her out even more. In the end, she rejects Redcorn and she and Dale are last seen purchasing a wig for her. Especially ironic since Dale is bald himself.
</li><li> "The Untitled Blake McCormick project": Shows that Redcorn saw other women while he was with Nancy and sired a daughter the same age as Joseph.
</li><li> As for John Redcorn himself: "Sug Night" has him break down in tears after Hank admits to having erotic dreams about her, showing how much he still loves a woman he can't have and "Vision Quest" shows how painful it is for Redcorn to have to watch another man raise his son.
<ul><li> Furthermore, also in "Vision Quest" Redcorn attempts to send his son on a "spirit journey" without telling him what it is or why its so important, only for it to backfire completely, as Joseph simply becomes angry and Dale is the only one who has a vision telling him that John Redcorn slept with his wife and fathered his child. Though Dale totally misses the point, the fact that it's implied the spirits of Redcorn's own ancestors are on Dale's side is pretty hilarious.

She does beat the hell out of him in front of everyone and while crying about how he's no longer cool, the others inform him that they've never thought he was cool and that their opinions of him couldn't possibly go any lower, which Cartman interprets as them trying to cheer him up because they really do like him.

</li><li> Chris McLean ends up getting away with nearly everything he does, aside from the occasional mishap here and there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, except for in "Brains vs. Brawn: The Ultimate Showdown", where karma finally catches up to him after he unwittingly blows himself up and is subsequently arrested by the Canadian government for his environmental crimes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Unfortunately, this doesnt last, as the network posts bail and releases him so he can keep producing the show.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Sentinel Prime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> is an odd example. In the backstory, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> (he was responsible for the incident that got Optimus Prime kicked to space bridge repair and Elita-1 turned into Blackarachnia, but got off scot-free and is now part of the Elite Guard because Optimus took the blame), but as soon as he lands on Earth, karma decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">make an example out of him</a>, starting with disrespecting human traffic laws and falling off an unfinished overpass. As acting Magnus, he's reprimanded for his attempt to destroy the Decepticon controlled Omega Supreme, ignoring the risk of destroying Cybertron. And in the final moments of the series, his rival, Optimus Prime, who he has mocked over the series, is hailed as a hero for capturing Megatron, while Sentinel is shown scowling in the crowd cheering for him.
</li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots">Transformers: Rescue Bots</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> Madeline Pynch gets away with illegal digging, including brainwashing the town of Griffin Rock into doing it, activates a doomsday weapon by accident and ultimately almost sinking the town—and unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Dr. Morocco, gets away scot-free for that last stunt. The Season 4 episode "Cody's 11" sees Karma deliver a swift kick to her ass as the Burns and Bots decide to take back what she stole after she swiped some unstable Energon and tried to market it as an alternate energy source, and had the foresight to switch the mind-wiping Verne Device out with a fake and record her confession. Even her attempt to blackmail them fails as the town has learned the true nature of the Bots at the start of the season and accepted them.
