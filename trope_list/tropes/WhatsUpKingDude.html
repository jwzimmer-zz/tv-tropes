<div class="indent">— <strong>Adelhyde Castle Guard</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em>
</div></div><p>The phenomenon in fiction (primarily in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a>) of commoners being allowed improbably free access to the royal family.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, access to royal families is usually tightly controlled, and in most cases commoners, unless they are friends with royal family members, are not allowed to have extended interaction with royals outside of formal events. Not in fiction, though. In fiction, Farmer Alice can go into the royal palace and give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingBobTheNth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingBobTheNth">King Bob the Nth</a> their secret handshake and a slap on the ass and say "What's up, King Dude?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a> tend to do this more than others, since they're already active anyway and "actually doing something" more often than not entails working with common folk.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The reason for this trope is probably the fact that, in ancient times, rulers of small clans and chiefdoms were often referred to as "kings". Later on, such as in the Renaissance, these stories were modified to better fit then-modern times (i.e. with bigger kingdoms and more powerful kings) but they forgot to edit the part about the farmer visiting his "king".
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Royal security did, however, remain rather porous</a>; common peasants were certainly not allowed in the palace, but just about anyone who could afford a nice set of clothes and some bribes could enter freely, especially during the eras of feudalism where local lords held more practical power than the king did. It was in early days of colonialism that royals grew tremendously in power and thus allowed few of common blood into their courts. (The fact that easy access to concealed firearms suddenly made political assassinations <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Murray#Assassination">depressingly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent#Assassination">easier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> certainly didn't help things.)

Many RPGs require players to consult the king before the adventure proper begins.

He's never outright disrespectful, he just never learned social niceties due to living alone for the formative years of his life. It gets really interesting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when we meet Zen'o, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">King of Everything</a> and literally the most powerful being in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> multiverse. Goku's casual attitude completely horrifies everyone else, but Zen'o likes Goku specifically <em>because</em> he treats him like a normal person, whereas everyone else in the 12 universes treats him with a mix of utter respect and pants-wetting terror because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">he once destroyed six entire universes</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">because he was in a bad mood</a>.

</li><li> To a lesser extent is Queen Otohime of Fishman Island's Ryugu Kingdom, who would daily make public addresses in the middle of town when she could just as easily do so from the palace. It's noted as a part of both her own nature and those of her abilities (a form of clairvoyance called Haki) that she prefers to be among her people.

In chapter 26 Asuka and Shinji find them sunbathing nonchalantly:
<div class="indent"><em>The coast of their island's shore curved around and brought them back towards their own cabin's end. They'd sighted a few other cabins along the way, but saw no other people or signs of activity until they reached a point near the next cabin up the island from Ching's. Under a wide sunshade, two beach chairs were occupied by figures that grew more familiar, but puzzling as they walked closer. <br/>Asuka tilted her head and tried to reconcile what she was seeing with what she knew. The blonde hair and red beard were the same, but it was still hard to believe that the man in the first chair with the aviator sunglasses, white and red short-sleeved tropical shirt, and ratty shorts was their usually armored and caped host. Just as normal yet thereby odd was the Witch Queen next to him, now in a colorful sarong and backless swimsuit. <br/>Daniel raised a coconut and paper umbrella drink at them as they drew near. "G'day, howdy-do, and hiya, kids. Having a good morning?" He nodded at their still joined hands. "Or are you still sort of feeling your way into things?" he asked in jaunty Japanese.</em>

The plot is kick-started when the doors are opened again for Elsa's coronation ceremony. Once they do, Princess Anna rushes out among both aristocracy and villagers, eager to mingle with "<em>everyone</em>". The opening is only temporary, though, Elsa continues to invert the trope so much that even her own sister, the usually bold Anna, awaits Elsa's permission to stand next to her - even after the royal steward physically moves her there, Anna steps back to give Elsa a respectful space until Elsa herself indicates her interest in speaking with her. However, Anna shows Elsa how to overcome her fear and the film ends with them opening the gates permanently and ice-skating together with the public.
</li><li> Also, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaAndElsa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaAndElsa">Anna &amp; Elsa</a></em> spin-off books portray Elsa as a down-to-earth queen who often leaves the palace and mingles with the commoners.

<ul><li> Usually not played straight, but Lord Vetinari's guards are under orders to accept any and all bribes, and he generally doesn't object to any commoner with both enough courage and a good enough reason to walk right up to his desk. Given that he cultivates a reputation as a tyrant (a very benevolent and competent one, nonetheless), anyone who gets that far is probably worth listening to for a minute. It helps immensely that he's known to be an alumnus of the Assassin's Guild, but no-one can quite remember exactly what his focus was. And no-one wants to be the one to find out by trying anything funny. It should be noted that the people allowed into the Palace to see the Patrician aren't simply free to wander into his office. They're shown into a waiting room with very hard benches and the door is locked behind them, leaving them to wait if Vetinari is inclined to see them — or let them leave. He's also been known to reverse the situation by visiting people at their home or workplace unexpectedly, without any bodyguards. (Though the other people are hardly relaxed enough at this point to be typical examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">What's Up, King Dude?</a>.) He's largely protected by the fact that nobody wants him dead, at least not urgently enough to take a potshot at him in the street.
</li><li> The situation in Lancre is... complex. Basically, royal security consists of Shawn Ogg, who is more likely to obey his mam than his monarch. Verence wants to be a man of the people in any case, but the Lancrastians believe the king <em>should</em> be holed up in the palace eating, quaffing and exercising his <em>droit de seigneur</em> (which is believed to be some kind of big, hairy dog), and are mistrustful of one who wants to <em>listen</em> to them. In fact, when Verence attempts to make a parliament and form a constitutional monarchy the Lancrastians think he's just trying to fool them into doing his job for him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend">Arthurian Legend</a></em>: The below events, and many others, took place at Arthur's Pentecost Court which might be considered a sort of royal open house where all comers were feasted and invited to ask for boons.
<ul><li> In Thomas Malory's magnum opus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeMorteDarthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeMorteDarthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a></em>, a poor cowherd seems to just walk up to King Arthur and asks a favor of him. In fact, a lot of quests and tales begin with some stranger just waltzing in to say/do something.
</li><li> The Green Knight from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></em> rides his horse straight into the main hall during a feast.

Children often play games and sports in his throne room because of ease of access, and they know that he is far more likely to join in their games than shoo them out of the castle.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em>, since the lack of guarding results in Princess Jenna being kidnapped.
</li><li> Eon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries">Belisarius Series</a></em> is first seen arm wrestling with Roman soldiers. He comes from an informal but spartan and militaristic culture where princes are first and foremost expected to prove themselves as soldiers and playing with soldiers is as natural to him as fighting beside them. The pragmatic reason for this is that the soldiers of the regiments are the ones who have final say on which prince will inherit the throne. A prince who is not liked by the common soldiers will not become king.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>. While the main characters refer to the emperor informally they are closely related. Armsmen have close access but not informal access.
</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> novels. Technically, any citizen of the Empire can seek an audience with the Empress at a certain time each week; in practice, her guards and bureaucrats make the process of requesting such an audience so intimidating and bothersome that most commoners back off and leave long before they get near her. Likewise, while it's possible for any citizen to communicate with the Empress psychically, peasants are never taught <em>how</em> to do so, and other social classes are warned that she might use the Imperial Orb to destroy their minds if they contact her for any reason <em>she</em> doesn't consider worthy of her time.
</li><li> Mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>; however, while hearing petitions on King Robert's behalf, Ned is surprised when many of the peasants do not know what their king looks like, hinting that things may typically be less formal in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">North</a>.
</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series when Harrington remarks that she should probably drop in to the palace to visit Queen Elizabeth III. The person she's saying this to, Elizabeth's cousin and one of the few people who actually <em>could</em> just decide to drop by for a visit (although probably needing an appointment herself), is privately amused that Harrington, a career naval officer coming from a middle-class family on one of the kingdom's secondary planets, had become someone so politically and personally important that she should so casually suggest doing something that her highest-ranking military superiors and the vast majority of the kingdom's nobility and aristocracy simply wouldn't even consider or even be allowed to do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall">Wolf Hall</a></em> generally doesn't have this—by the time of Henry VIII kings were more separated from their people, although Henry makes a point of showing himself in public places a few times and it's not difficult for the nun Elizabeth Barton to get close and start giving him disturbing prophecies. And on the informality front, there's his boyhood friend and brother-in-law Charles Brandon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> who will wander into a room and shout things like "Aren't you ready Harry?!" This irritates Thomas Cromwell to no end, especially when Brandon starts gossiping loudly in front of a foreign ambassador (at which point Cromwell physically drags him out of the room).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMule">The Mule</a>": Because Ebling Mis is the most respected scientist on Terminus, a planet founded by scientists about three centuries ago, he alone manages to get away with being informal around the the Head of State. He wears shabby clothing, smokes, speaks profanely (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeProfanityFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeProfanityFilter">or so the narrative says</a>), and insult the Mayor directly.
</li><li> Not uncommon in several kingdoms of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiddleMasterTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiddleMasterTrilogy">The Riddle Master Trilogy</a></em> trilogy, owing to their small size and/or sparse population allowing subjects to have rather casual relationships with their monarch. Morgon, the main protagonist, is the Prince of Hed, but as Hed is a tiny island that doesn't take much more than a day to cross on foot and is mostly inhabited by farmers, his job is less that of a monarch and more that of the mayor of a rural community, complete with local swineherds dropping by most mornings for breakfast and people asking the Prince to personally fix their leaky roofs being a fairly typical occurrence (and he'll do it, too). Har, the Wolf-King of Osterland, is personally intimidating but nonetheless fairly genial unless you cross him, and his far-northern kingdom has more animals in it than people and his throne room tends to have the air of a mead hall more than a solemn center of government; Danan Isig, who rules the mountain of the same name, is more the patriarch of a large extended family than anything more formal. Subverted with the nations of An, Ymris, and Herun, which are larger and more powerful than any of the above and have much more formal and complex royal courts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NumberTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NumberTheStars">Number the Stars</a></em>: While the main character never tried to approach him herself, it's commented that the reason the king of Denmark has no guards during his parade is because every citizen of Denmark would gladly put their life down for him.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a>, quite literally, in "To Play the King" — The King decides to embark on a meet'n'greet tour through Britain without his security detail (to manifest his reputation as a 'people's monarch' and to build popular support against PM Urquhart). Urquhart, in return, exploits this by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">arranging a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">'summer theatre'</a> in which the King gets 'kidnapped' by a group of paid thugs and then be "rescued" by the British Army at Urquhart's behest, making him look like a hero and the King like a callous idiot</span>.
</li><li> Played straight in "The Final Cut" — Urquhart's own limousine is rammed off the motorway by some random trio of drunken punks in a minibus who are looking for a fight (but probably didn't realise <em>whose</em> limousine they just hit). Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> in that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">promptly shot by Urquhart's own bodyguards as "terrorists"</a>.

Major Kira, who granted is the second-in-command to the Emissary on the most strategic installation in the quadrant, still seems to get away with a lot in terms of informal meetings in which she can get very lippy indeed. Then there's Jake and Nog in "In the Cards", and, more grimly, "Anjohl Tennan" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(read "Gul Dukat")</span> in the closing arc. In the last case, the Kai's aide was at least duly incredulous (eventually), pointing out that the man simply appeared one day for an audience with the Kai and had, over-night, become her closest adviser to the point of living in her residence and ordering her servants and priests around.
</li><li> The short-lived comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsMyBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsMyBush">That's My Bush!</a></em> parodied the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

Of course Alustriel is one of the best spellcasters of the setting — in top of what she has for being a Chosen of Mystra — and is protected by both a number of magic objects and the wizards, etc. of her court.

At first he's inclined to grant them all what they want, but when that turns out to be not such a good idea, he falls back on telling them the same answers his father used to give to nobles' requests: "Denied!" and "Take that man away and hang him!"
</li><li> A central theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV">Henry IV</a></em>. Prince Hal has a friendly, casual friendship with Sir John Falstaff that his father the King thinks entirely inappropriate because being overly familiar, especially with disreputable people, means they will not respect the King when the time comes. Sure enough, while Falstaff is jolly, and has some surprisingly nuanced thoughts on honor, he is an unreliable and shifty character that stains the prince's reputation with his very presence, and Hal only starts becoming a good king (or starts being perceived as such) after ridding himself of that association.

As long as you are of the same faction, you can just barge into the royal throne room and talk to the king/queen/president. Semi-justified as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> is in full effect here.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em> lets you stroll up to some fairly important people, like Elrond or Galadriel. In fairness, though, you're not exactly having a casual chat with them... either they've specifically sent for you because they want your help with something, or someone they already know has sent you to talk with them. Depending on your race, you may even know some of them already yourself (for example, the introduction for elves shows that you were on the scene six hundred years ago when Elrond soloed a troll; your contribution to this epic combat was basically to stand there and pee yourself, but he <em>does</em> know you). Of course this is somewhat justifiable. To meet Elrond for instance, one has to first walk through most of the valley of Rivendell to the Last Homely House, presumably being watched at every turn. To meet Galadriel is even harder as one has to <em>earn</em> the right to enter Lothlórien first, otherwise you risk getting peppered by arrows by multiple hidden archers.
</li><li> Seems to be the case in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> series. Okay, Mario and the like might be justified for having saved the kingdom a few hundred times, but apparently anyone even remotely affiliated with them can walk straight through the front door of the castle without opposition. Or how Bowser really, really ends up getting right next to Peach pretty dang often, at least in the RPGs, where he apparently just walks through the front door before Mario and Luigi have to defeat him practically next to the throne.

Seeing as Lino doesn't dress like a king and acts very casually himself, he could easily be mistaken for a servant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">A very large, muscular servant.</a>
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em>: the Queen is living in an insular bubble, and relies on her sister and a few select knights to maintain contact with the common people. The player character's access to the Queen is on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">being her son</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Kings and Queens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> games are typically lazy about security. Sure they'll have guards stationed at various points in the castle, but you can pretty much walk up and talk to them without any trouble. In most cases, the main character is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">royalty, a hero or offspring of a hero whose deeds are known the world over, or the local ruler is so desperate to find a way to deal with whatever monster invasion of the week is tearing his kingdom apart that he pretty much accepts anyone with a sword and a willingness to accept suicidal missions</a>
</li><li> Common in the 2D-era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games, up to and including exploring the royal <em>bedrooms</em>. In the very first game, you even have to go and find the king on your own initiative (more or less). Several games in the series justify this: Cecil is the foster son of Baron's king in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, most of the player characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> are royalty themselves, and King Edgar of Figaro is in liason with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Returners</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight">Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</a></em>, Brandt and his friends are frequently cautioned by the guards of whatever castle they visit to be on their best behavior in front of the throne. (Even though one of them is herself a princess—though of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> variety.)
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> You are able to speak to Teyrn Loghain before the Battle of Ostagar, though the easiest way is for you to pick the Human Noble origin and tell the guard that the reason that Loghain should deign to speak to you is because you're the child of the only other Teyrn in Ferelden, Bryce Cousland, who has been killed in a sneak attack on his castle.
</li><li> Another way is to persuade the guard to allow you to speak with him. This still makes sense however, as the Warden is a member of a well-respected order dedicated to fighting the Darkspawn, the enemy they are soon to be facing in the upcoming battle.
</li><li> Deconstructed by King Cailan, who mentions driving Loghain insane by constantly disappearing to spend time talking and drinking with the soldiers at Ostagar, with very few guards present to keep an eye on him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If Alistair becomes King at the Landsmeet, it's mentioned in one of the epilogues that he does the same thing as his half-brother, often sneaking out of the palace to buy everyone a few rounds at the local tavern</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's actually averted pretty neatly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>.
<ul><li> While you can wander into the Viscount's Keep whenever you want, you're only allowed to see the Viscount himself when you're called into his chambers. Unless you personally save his son's life in Act 1, you won't meet him until you've made your fortune.
</li><li> Similarly, while Hawke can wander into the Gallows' courtyard at any time in the first two acts, they're only granted access to the inner sanctum and Knight-Commander Meredith and First Enchanter Orsino in the third act, after having become Champion and one of the key players in the city.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em>, villagers are frequently seen in the Throne Room interacting with the Monarch, Royal Advisor and visiting diplomats. Also inverted since when playing as the monarch you'll spend a lot of time running around the kingdom bothering your subjects in person.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> downplays the trope. You can try and waltz into the personal quarters of various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great House</a> nobles if you want to, but they will not talk business with you unless you have a reason for bothering this particular noble (i.e. have a letter for them, are a high-enough ranking member of their House to serve them directly, are sent with a secret diplomatic mission, are a noble too and want to get a land deed from the Duke, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> and need them to acknowledge that fact to fulfill a prophecy, etc). To have business with them, you should have business with their henchmen, hirelings, and recruiters in the House Council Halls first. And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">god-kings</a> of the Tribunal avert this absolutely; you will not meet one unless they want to meet you (or you're brazen enough to crack the Difficulty 100 lock, in Vivec's case, at which point he simply refuses to speak with you).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>, the Counts and Countesses apparently have an open-door policy, allowing anyone who comes during visiting hours to wander in, armed to the teeth, and have a friendly chat. It makes the one Count in the game who generally refuses audiences with commoners to seem stand-offish by comparison. This is possibly justified later on in the game, when you're a hero renowned throughout Cyrodil, and have done each and every one of the Counts and Countesses at least one personal favor. But at the beginning of the game, when you're a total nobody (and an escaped convict at that), it doesn't make a lot of sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jarls seem to have the same kind of open-door policy. The Dragonborn can just walk in and ask if they have a job for him. In fact, it is usually harder to get into a town jarl resides in (one dialogue with a guard) then to get into the Jarl's palace.
</li><li> It's played with in the beginning of <em>Skyrim</em>, as when you first go into Dragonsreach, Balgruuf's Housecarl Irileth stops you and demands to know your business, and you can't get past her until you tell her. She later tells Balgruuf he should stop sneaking down to the local tavern for a pint with the commoners. Balgruuf, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good Jarl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">as hard-drinking as any Nord</a>, refuses.
</li><li> Also the first time you visit the Palace of the Kings, when Ulfric Stormcloak tells you that "only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons." It's worth noting that the extra caution in Windhelm and Whiterun is justified, since Ulfric is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">leading a rebellion</a> and Balgruuf is pissing off the Stormcloaks and the Imperials alike by trying to maintain neutrality - both are prime assassination targets.
</li><li> Faleen (housecarl to Igmund) also confronts you the first time you approach him in Understone Keep.
</li><li> Similarly averted in the <em>Dawnguard</em> expansion, where the only reason Lord Harkon agrees to allow the Dragonborn into the Castle Volkihar for an audience, is because they are escorting his daughter. If you turn down his offer to become a Vampire Lord as reward for your service, he spares your life but immediately banishes you from the premises.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em>, in one of the towns about halfway through the game, the item and weapon shops are connected to the castle. When you approach them, the King comes running up to stand behind the counter, and says something like "Just because I'm King, doesn't mean I can't make some money!"
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>. Players can freely approach the king and queen of Misthalin, yet the king and crown prince of Asgarnia do not even appear as ingame characters. One of the two kings of Kandarin is likewise accessible, yet the throne room guards of Miscellania will only allow a 'hero' in to see the king. These are some examples, but there is a bit more as well.
</li><li> A frequent occurrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em>, though there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades all over the place</a>, and in most places some form of justification:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> pulling the strings for you (Kaocho and arguably Morgal),

</li><li> The most heavily-lampshaded instance is when, after your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill">awkward arrival</a> into Ayuthay, you are immediately taken to see King Paithos... because he had a standing order that any Adepts who showed up were to be brought to him in case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Amiti's father</a> was with them.
<ul><li> This clearly runs in the royal family of Ayuthay. Amiti's reaction to learning a group of Adepts sent by their enemies have infiltrated the sanctuary? Personally greet them and offer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a>. And Amiti's mother was apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">a little more than friendly</a> to an unknown foreign Adept about twenty years prior.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, since the party consists of the son of a high ranking noble who's also nephew to the king, and fiance to the princess, who's also part of the party, and his personal servant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is later restored to his former status of noble</span>, as well as the best friend and personal advisor to the emperor of another nation, personal guard to the highest religious authority in the game world (who also travels with the party) and a soldier who works personally for yet another high ranking religious authority <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and is a descendant of Yulia, giving her status in the Qliphoth.</span> The party more or less has access to everywhere in the world, conveniently enough, which leads the aforementioned princess to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">wonder out loud</a> if it was ordained by the score.

Darunia also bars himself off until a royal messenger arrives, although he apparently has an open door policy at all other times. The Great Deku Tree seems like he's <em>supposed</em> to be like this, but Mido arbitrarily won't let Link through. Played straight with King Zora; only the Royal Family or its messengers (i.e. anyone who can play Zelda's Lullaby) can enter Zora's Domain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>, Link is able to just waltz into the mayor's office during an important town meeting, and his wife's audience room (where she just kind of assumes that he's an investigator that she sent for). There's a receptionist who seems like she's supposed to control visitors, but she seems pretty disinterested.
<ul><li> The Deku Scrubs normally avert this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">They won't let humans enter their palace at all</a>, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Link as a scrub</a> is only allowed to enter because it's a special occasion.

However, if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">manage to skip that meeting spot and travel straight to the throne room</a>, Sidon is instead prepared to escort Link out before seeing that he is a Hylian. The Sheikah and Gerudo chiefs are also fairly closely guarded, with Link only being granted an audience with either because they recognize his Sheikah Slate; their protectiveness is also justified because of their frequent conflicts with the murderous Yiga Clan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em>: Graham tends to take this approach to leadership. Justified by the fact he started his career as a low-level knight and hadn't any ambitions higher than serving the country of Daventry. He just happened to be the knight the dying Edward the Benevolent trusted most, which made him heir to the throne. Graham is very much a soldier and adventurer at heart and will ditch royal finery for his favorite red tunic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> as soon as he's given opportunity: he's rarely seen wearing anything else, and according to the opening of the fifth game, makes a habit of walking through his kingdom unescorted.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeTheHardWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeTheHardWay">Three the Hard Way</a></em>. The party is only able to enter the palace because they are travelling with Duchess Fayette, and even the Duchess herself was only allowed to eventually meet the king because there was an ongoing conference between the King and his vassal dukes.

His guards however want visitors to at least dress decently. The player first meets Olivia and Daemon/Damien (the rulers of the two other human kingdoms) as Castele's <em>de facto</em> ambassador and becomes quick friends with them. The player is free to come and go to their palaces once the story chapters in which they are introduced are finished and Olivia tands to spend lots of time outside her palace anyway.
</li><li> Studiously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>.

</li><li> Asgore, King of All Monsters, is built up throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> as the final boss, the one who you have to get past in order to escape the monster populated Underground. However, as you approach his castle, you see notes telling you exactly where to find him and inviting anyone with any concerns to come and talk to him.
<ul><li> Possibly justified, given Asgore is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating">100% Adoration Rating</a>, the kingdom appears to have a low crime rate, and anyone threatened by his regime live outside the Underground and probably don't even know Asgore's kingdom exists, so the chances of anyone having motive to assassinate him are pretty low. He's also a powerful sorcerer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">one of the deadliest combatants</a> in the Underground, so he can probably keep an open door policy since any attempt on his life during visiting hours would be suicidal.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker">Princess Maker</a> 2</em>, this is downplayed. As the daughter of a hero, you have the right to visit the castle, but you won't be admitted to speak with anyone of importance if you don't have enough Decorum skill. Still, you can chat with the King all you like once you get that high, and you can meet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the young prince</span> every January regardless of your Decorum.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>, but sometimes averted in <em>Warband</em>. In the latter, if you meet the King in the field, he'll give you the time of day, but admission to the royal palace during a feast is limited to nobles and tournament winners.
</li><li> Usually averted in most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> games. Getting into a castle requires either a key, a pass or status of some kind, though the specifics differ from game to game and castle to castle. If you have admittance to a castle, you can usually speak to the local lord or king (if he's there) and get his quests.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostHeir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostHeir">The Lost Heir</a></em>, <em>you</em> are the monarch starting in the middle of the second game, but commoners will come running up to you to ask for help or do business with you, and nobody thinks that that's odd. In the third game, you can try to rein in some of this if you want.
</li><li> The society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfDragonPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfDragonPass">King of Dragon Pass</a></em> is made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">tough</a> hunter/gatherer tribes who strongly believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a>. So anyone, no matter how foreign or poor, can and do randomly walk in and make requests of the chief. It helps that the chief's council is semi-democratic, and when a tribe gets too big (over 1000+ people) tensions will rise because now many families aren't represented on it. According to legend, the chief god Orlanth runs his court in exactly the same way.
</li><li> In the adventure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a></em>, of the protagonists, Hoagie, is sent back in time in the late 1790s and he finds the Founding Fathers of America at a mansion: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> (who at this point is the President of the USA), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnHancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnHancock">John Hancock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. They are just lounging at a living room, smoking cigars or playing with a kite, with no guards or any security personnel to protect them. Hoagie, a complete stranger, can just speak with them and give items as he pleases.
</li><li> Random events in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em> can sometimes give the impression that your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> has an open door policy and walks around their realm without entourages or bodyguards, letting just about anyone in their realm within arm's length with no problem. This can be justified playing as a tribal ruler or a minor count, not so much when playing as the Emperor of a major world power like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheByzantineEmpire">The Byzantine Empire</a>. Most events also don't check for alternate government types like horse nomads, leading to events like people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">trying to assassinate you by sabotaging the balcony of your yurt... and succeeding</a>.

He'll even patch his servants up faster than a Priest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaLink">Fate/Extella Link</a></em>, Charlemagne dispenses with his title as the King of the Franks, simply asking Hakuno and the other Servants to call him Charlie or Chuck and treat him like any other Servant when they try to address him formally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em>: Soon after Aloy first arrives in the Carja capital of Meridian, she is escorted before Sun-King Avad, and thereafter can run up to speak to him at any moment. It's made clear that she is an exceptional case; there is a long line of petitioners when she first arrives, complaining that a savage outlander is allowed to skip the line. By this point, Aloy already has an impressive reputation as a problem-solver, a reputation only confirmed when she meets Avad and immediately helps him with a number of serious issues he is facing.

But the king himself is never present in said throne room (except in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">H'aanit's final chapter, where her</span> audience with the king is perfectly justified).
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>: If you're following the storyline rather than exploring, by the time you see any of the major faction leaders face-to-face, you've been summoned by them and you do get challenged on the way through the Legion camp. However, in most cases there's nothing stopping you from walking up to any of the leaders after that point and striking up a conversation, and you can walk into multiple NCR military bases and talk to the people in charge without anyone even blinking. Most of the smaller faction leaders are easily accessed as well, with the only barriers between you and them being a single conversation or (in the case of the Boomers) a sprint through an artillery barrage, and those only happen the first time you approach.

<ul><li> Very commonplace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, where civilians address monarchs with nicknames while partying in their palaces and royals tend to be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">incompetently guarded</a>, if they are at all. Occasionally justified: Princess Bubblegum considers herself a mother figure to her subjects and thus regularly consorts with them, while many of the other royals are teenagers and/or live modestly. Downplayed with the Fire Kingdom under the Flame King, who must be formally and subserviently addressed, even if he does allow the same level of access.

Her friends and their families in particular seem to mostly ignore the fact that she's technically royalty and treat her like anybody else. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> here, as most ponies already knew her before her coronation, and she's not really inclined to make them treat her differently.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Early U.S. presidents were fond of doing this, starting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, who often invited working-class folks to his parties, which were informal and wild and featured whiskey and roast beef instead of champagne and caviar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> made sure the White House's phone number was in the phone book and answered all of the calls <em>himself</em>; interesting to note, he also answered his own doorbell.
<ul><li> "Schott's Miscellany" includes a description of Presidential meet-and-greets: everybody (from foreign aristocrats to poor folks) gathered in a waiting room, lined up. They would then file through the meeting chamber, shake hands with the President and maybe exchange a few words, and file out. To be clear, there was no vetting process, no verification of why one wanted to meet the President, or what one intended to say to him. President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley">William McKinley</a> was assassinated during just such an event at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">James Garfield</a> was assassinated while walking unguarded into a crowded train station. In fact, Garfield's assassin had earlier gained entrance to the White House and <em>met</em> Garfield (he was trying to get a diplomatic post).
</li><li> There was a time when anyone could walk up to the front door of the White House and knock. Exactly when this stopped is up to some debate - during the Civil War or World War II, but the fact is you once could. You still can! Provided you take the tour though. The end is an exit through the front door.
</li><li> For those touring the White House, from time to time, the tour group might run into a member of the First Family, usually the President or the First Lady, who are not busy and happy to talk a little with the tour group. Typically these are planned but not announced, and usually favors school groups.
</li><li> Jeffery Dahmer, a notorious serial killer, once called up the Vice President while on a high school trip to D.C. and got a meeting with the Veep for his class. He wouldn't begin killing until just after he graduated high school.
</li><li> As late as the 1950s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> was taking morning strolls about town, accompanied by only a single guard. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the era of semi-unfettered (semi-fettered?) access to the President ended with the assassination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> At the closing ceremony of the 1912 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> in Stockholm, Swedish King Gustav V praised American Jim Thorpe as the greatest athlete in the world. Thorpe's response? "Thanks, King!"
<ul><li> His son Gustaf VI faced even more informality after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> in 1958: once he went down to the pitch to salute the victorious Brazilian team, the team dentist hugged him while saying "Hey King! How you doin'?".
</li></ul></li><li> Charlemagne to a great extent. As well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestRoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestRoyalty">dressing very much like a commoner</a>, it is also said of him that he would happily dine with commoners. His court was more or less a continuous feast, interrupted chiefly for sleep and prayers (if that), at which state business would occasionally be conducted; anyone making an appearance for any reason would be invited to participate in the merrymaking. Charlemagne is also said to have held education in such high esteem that he would sometimes sit in a schoolroom along with the children learning there.
</li><li> Alfred the Great once had a set of petitioners follow him into his private chamber - in those days a separate building - and interrupt him while he was washing his face. He calmly toweled himself off while listening to their problem.
</li><li> During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, King Christian X took a daily ride through the streets of Copenhagen, unaccompanied. A German soldier is supposed to have asked "Who guards your King?", to which the response was "We all do."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23p0f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23p0f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23p0f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The actual wording of the exchange varies between sources</span>.
</li><li> The original word King comes from the Germanic form meaning "leader of kin" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">chieftain</a> in other words. Germanic "Kings" were expected to party with their warriors and share out spoil with them. The poetic name for King is "ring-giver" meaning they gave out rewards to their followers including rings, items of jewelry which had a mystic significance because of their unending circularity and which were often attached to swords. The image expected was of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianHero">Barbarian Hero</a> leading a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe">Barbarian Tribe</a>, rather than the center of attention at an extravagant ceremony.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> suffered a lot from his "What's up, Premier Dude" attitude in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">a civil war</a>; one time, some gangbangers kicked him out of his car, the other time he was shot, fell ill because of the complications and died soon after. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">His successor</a>, on the other hand, was very paranoid and anal about security.
<ul><li> "Lenin and petitioners" was a stock scene depicted in Soviet art and theater. Apparently he received a lot of petitioning and complaining peasants.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern Scandinavian monarchies are very austere and down to earth, and the monarchs freely mingle with their people. They do maintain protocol as far as addressing them goes. Adressing them by the folksy "Du" ("You"), as opposed to the honorific "De", will often result in a sharp rebuke. Modern Dutch monarchs—who, although <em>not</em> Scandinavian, tend to hang out with the Scandinavian ones<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30b1f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30b1f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30b1f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Before you ask, the reason appears to be that the Dutch and Scandinavian monarchies are geographically nearby along the North Sea, etc., and all historically Protestant. Although Belgium and Luxembourg are closer to the Netherlands, they are Catholic, and historically Protestant and Catholic European royals traveled in slightly different social circles, with some limited family-based exceptions (e.g. the affinity between the Belgian and British royals, through the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha).</span>—are similar, but replace "Du" with "jou/je" and "De" with "u".
</li><li> Norwegian kings (at least, Olav and Harald), are known for their commonality:
<ul><li> Olav V was particularly notorious for this. A story goes that he was on a military parade, and asked for a smoke. When requested what kind of cigarette, he answered bluntly "Hell, whatever, as long as it smokes..." Olav was loved for his ability to talk and converse with (almost) everyone. When he first came to Norway after being elected king<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4rvr9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4rvr9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4rvr9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This in itself horrified more traditional royalty of 1905 — "[he] is going around <em>thanking</em> the people for electing him!"</span>, Haakon VII (Olav's father), who was <em>not</em> known for this, was actually not officially addressed as "Your Majesty", but rather as "Mister King".
</li><li> As for the current Norwegian queen: she actually <em>asked</em> a journalist to drop the honorifics and adress her with the commmon "du"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5khi2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5khi2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5khi2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> she was, after all, born a commoner, although of the medium wealthy kind</span>. After this, most journalists avoid the problem by using the third-person: "does the king enjoy himself?"
</li></ul></li><li> Many small countries have this kind of attitude toward their top people; for example, it is not very difficult for just about anyone to meet with the Prime Minister of Iceland.
</li><li> In 1991, Washington, D.C. resident Alice Frazier greeted Queen Elizabeth II with a folksy "How are ya doin'?" and then pulled her into a hug. The queen smiled and quickly backed out of it. British sticklers for protocol were horrified and outraged, for one simply does not touch the queen. But it was Ms. Frazier's custom to greet every visitor to her home with a big warm hug, and she wasn't about to make any exceptions.
