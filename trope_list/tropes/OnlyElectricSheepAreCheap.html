<p>In many near-future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopian</a> science fiction settings, prices on some items, particularly natural things created by natural processes, are quite high, as opposed to mass-produced via synthetic processes. This is particularly the case if the setting is specifically shown to be one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament">severe environmental degradation</a>, where agriculture is difficult or natural agricultural products unsafe, or where most natural-born animals are extinct. People just take it for granted that certain things are not to be had for regular folks, or that if they are, they're grown in batches in laboratories, or in the case of animals, they may be machines designed to look like the real thing.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Can be written off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License  Biology</a>, if it's not justified by pollution or disease having reduced the remaining real organisms' fertility. Making more of themselves is something that living things tend to be pretty good at, after all. For agricultural products, it may be explained by an economy of scale — once most people switch to the cheaper synthetic product, the real thing becomes even <em>more</em> expensive because it's made in smaller quantities.
</p><p>This trope typically occurs when one character encounters an object, usually food or an animal, and questions the owner about it. They may ask "Is this real?" to which the owner of a synthetic item/cloned animal replies "Of course not." Or if the character is meant to be fabulously wealthy, or only the best will do, and the item is natural it could be "Of course."

<ul><li> In Mamoru Oshii's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a> 2: Innocence</em>, Togusa asks Batou if his basset hound is a clone, remarking that the real thing (as though a clone is any less real) is expensive. (Batou also feeds his dog real food, but this is not presented as an issue of cost, but one of taste.) <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is set in a world recovering from war, not (demonstrably) one with a thoroughly devastated environment, however, so the trope borders on cliche here.
<ul><li> Of course in a world where cybernetics and androids are so plentiful, it could be that some people keep robotic pets that don't have the living and training needs of a real live one.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> series, the robotic Tachikomas regard all-natural motor oil as a real treat, much better than synthetic oil. Batou treating "his" Tachikoma differently from the rest, by regularly treating it to natural oil, is a catalyst for the robots developing individuality and self-awareness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That and the anomolies caused by the oil corroding part of its circuitboard</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>, pet animals are in fact so rare that everyone is quite shocked when Dorothy finds a cat. The owners come and take it back despite how attached Dorothy has gotten <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because it's really their son. A mad scientist turns people into animals <em>because</em> they're so incredibly rare. Or something. Later, it gets turned into a giant monster.</span> They're <em>that</em> rare, apparently.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a> 2.0</em>, this trope is played straight when the kids get shown a giant aquarium where specimens of pre-2nd impact sealife are preserved. Rei muses that they are the same as her and can't live outside this sheltered environment. Also, the fact that synthetic meat is the norm. The sheer dissonance between the kid's bewilderment at their first time seeing sea life, and Kaji and Misato's painful memories of the 2nd impact (Misato did not want to come because she would remember the event; Kaji wanted the kids to know what life was before 2nd impact), makes for a very dramatic moment as the viewer realizes this trope is in full effect. Slice of life AND backstory exposition AND character drama all rolled into one.
<ul><li> At one point in the series, Misato thinks that buying the EVA pilots a steak dinner would bankrupt her. Realising this they take her to a fast food place instead. Becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> when one realizes that she works for the most important and powerful organization in the world, has precisely <em>two</em> superiors - yet four steaks would wipe her out. If steak is <em>that</em> rare, is there <strong>anyone</strong> who can afford it?

While at the messdeck, Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres have to eat yeast-based protein as the meat vats and hydroponics garden are still being repaired. Later Captain Janeway invites Chakotay for a formal dinner at the officer's wardroom and they have beef and vegetables from the ship's stores, though the taste is a bit off from the irradiation used to preserve it for space travel. Janeway is surprised when she attends a luxurious banquet on an alien space station and finds their alien hosts are serving up fresh meat.

<ul><li> An early example of this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">Soylent Green</a></em>, where one character is excited about having "hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>, the planet's deteriorating condition has killed off most animals, causing people to keep synthetic pets. One can tell how prized they are by the fact that the Voigt-Kampf test scenarios, created to evoke an empathetic response, are mostly centered on animal cruelty.
<ul><li> In the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner2049" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner2049">Blade Runner 2049</a></em>, the protagonist acquires a carved wooden horse and is told he's rich because it's genuine wood.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> has elements of this, and <em>all</em> the food that isn't gruel is virtual. This is why, in <em>Reloaded</em>, some Zionites give Neo bread as a sign of admiration. It's the equivalent of giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">gold, frankincense and myrrh</a>.
</li><li> In the distant galaxy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KinDzaDza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KinDzaDza">Kin-Dza-Dza</a></em>, one of the transplanted Earthlings discovers that the wooden matchsticks he's carrying in his pocket are actually the most valuable things in the system, as <em>every last scrap of naturally-occurring organic or mineral material</em> had long since been converted into one kind of fuel or another. Water is bought by the <em>drop</em>, and food is made of <strong>plastic</strong>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waterworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waterworld">Waterworld</a></em>, potted plants and the soil to grow them in are considered valuable trade goods, as are non-sea-derived materials such as paper.

When they visit the 'scrap' society, he eagerly eats a hamburger. It's not beef... but at least it's not human. It's actually rat. He doesn't care and keeps on eating. He even says it's the best burger he's had in years. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0j96y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0j96y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0j96y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is, admittedly, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on the fact it's the <em>only</em> burger he's had in years, having spent the last 30 of them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryogenic stasis</a>.</span> It bears mentioning that unlike most examples on this page, meat eating isn't rare due to global disaster, it's a sign of how overly coddled and pacified human civilization has been rendered.
</li><li> German sci-fi movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sturzflieger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sturzflieger">Sturzflieger</a></em>.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zombieland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zombieland">Zombieland</a></em>, where the drive of one of the main characters is to find a stash of Twinkies. After all, plants still grow after a zombie apocalypse, but with the Hostess kitchen shut down, snack cakes become an endangered species.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash">The Adventures of Pluto Nash</a></em>, the events of the film take place on the Moon. Certain items are hard to come by on the Moon and aren't cheap to have delivered from Earth, the most commonly-mentioned being wood (not the stuff used in cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> furniture, but actual wood). At one point, a mobster is mentioned by someone to have had a briefcase made of genuine alligator skin. Naturally, this immediately outed him as an Earther.

Real animal pets are considered the ultimate status symbol, and new editions of a blue book are published listing each species's going rate. Many species are thought to be extinct. The main character owns an electric sheep, but conceals the fact that is artificial. At the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he discovers a toad, thought to be extinct, and thus priceless, but it turns out to be artificial as well.</span>

With humanity scattered across space, the puppy Jim the stowaway finds is a mysterious novelty to most of the crew, though Jim, coming from a backwater world that relies on animal labor, knows what it is. Real food can be had but won't keep for long trips in space so it is a special treat supplemented by nutrition bars and MREs. When the main character's ship takes on refugees from other ships after a war breaks out, a snotty-ass captain makes a big deal about his personal stock of expensive raspberries being divvied out as rations.
<ul><li> Oh, and the aforementioned dog (a Jack Russell?) ends up filling Jim's college fund when they arrive on a world where the local fauna has a tendency to kill dogs, making them rare and expensive. So they sell its sperm (in the same vein as selling racehorse sperm).

Part of the book deals with a dystopian future Earth run by "Fidipur", an agency created to "Feed the Poor" by using much of the Earth's biological productivity and advanced science to create very efficient food wafers that would seem unnatural to modern or premodern people. The population keeps growing and eventually all arable land is needed to make their strange wafers, so the last farms that produce vegetables for human consumption are shut down. A surprisingly long section of the book describes a documentary called "The Last Radish" and a random citizen is selected to have the honor of eating the last natural vegetable while the world watches. The trope is played straight in that natural food is considered very special and exclusive, but subverted in that the radish-eater gives the natural vegetable very poor marks in comparison to his regular ration of nutrition wafers.

It is set in a future "green utopia" in which every available surface is covered with growing plants — virtually all of which are ultimately rendered into either food or much-needed biofuel.

<ul><li> Inadvertently gets a laugh in the <em>Tir Tairngire</em> sourcebook, also from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>, when it's mentioned that the elves have somehow re-created extinct species for their wilderness areas. It's funny in that both of the named species, grizzly bears and gray wolves, are not only still alive and well today <em>without</em> any magical or cloning assistance, but they would have had to go extinct, all over the world and also in captivity, in <em>less than a decade</em> after the supplement was published, in order to meet the timeline suggested for their "extinction".
<ul><li> Also, depending on wording, it's unlikely that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxonomicTermConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxonomicTermConfusion">species</a> <em>Canis lupus</em> ever went extinct in captivity, unless the setting is also completely devoid of <em>dogs,</em> since technically domestic dogs are a subspecies of gray wolves. (To be fair, the reclassification of <em>Canis familiaris</em> was fairly recent, and after thousands of generations of human-controlled breeding, dogs no longer look or act much like their wild cousins. Still, they are interfertile and are currently considered the same species.)

Sure, your average shadowrunner is still subsisting mostly on soy, but you can still find most of what you'd see in RL 2011 in the shops of Shadowrun 2070 for not much more than the equivalent price.

Fresh food is an expensive commodity, only within the reach of rich people, and most of the population lives eating Kibble (a mass-produced food identical in all respects to the pet food that gives it its name) and what is basically artificial food not much better than Kibble. (Live) pets, short of wild animals, are expensive too, and one of the Chromebooks even features one corporation whose business follow the lines of pay-us-and-we-bring-you-the-animal-you-wants, even if it has to be stealing it from someone or worse.

Trueborn are the upper class, being born the biological way (due to the danger of Slaanesh claiming their souls during sex, and because the Dark Eldar wouldn't be the Dark Eldar if they didn't have an entire strata of society to look down on / plot to overthrow).

As a result, if you want to feed your citizens something tastier than processed seaweed, you need to keep the green documents flowing, and in order to do that, you need an obscenely developed material recycling industry.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> plays this completely straight with synthetic gemstones, which are completely identical to the natural stone chemically and have the same optics. One can buy several pounds of artificially created sapphires, emeralds, or rubies for the price of a single carat of the natural stuff, even though the natural one will actually be cloudier and less brilliant than the synthetics. And yes, this <em>includes</em> diamonds, which is why those used for industrial applications are almost exclusively synthetic while those used for jewelry are mostly natural and expensive due to shrewd marketing by De Beers, who control some 90% of the market.
</li><li> Free range or organic foods tend to be more expensive and luxurious then the industrial kind. Much like the gemstones above, this is almost entirely marketing.
</li><li> Wild-caught fish and shellfish and tend to be far more expensive than farmed. Same applies for hunted game, which is more expensive than farmed.
<ul><li> Seafood in general used to be considered poor-people food (because of the lack of refrigeration and fast goods delivery, fish could only be sold locally, and thus did not command high prices). The original reason the Catholic Church specifically does not consider seafood to be "meat" was so that poor people would have something to eat on "meatless" Fridays and during Lent.
</li></ul></li><li> Russian sturgeon caviar. Some centuries ago, it was just a byproduct of fishing. Now it is VERY expensive to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarketProduce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarketProduce">being illegal and restricted</a>, because sturgeon is close to extinction.
<ul><li> There is an old Polish recipe for sauerkraut and caviar. That's right, people used caviar to <em>season sauerkraut!</em>
</li><li> Not quite on the same level as caviar, but the demand that the employer not feed them salmon more than two times a week was fairly standard for hired hands seeking employment in XVIII century Russia.
</li><li> When your great-grandma was young fried sturgeon and catfish were listed as a cheap Friday dinner for seasonal laborers. Now good luck finding any of them in other place than the most expensive fish shops.
</li><li> Before XIX century lobsters, oysters and basically all kind of seafood used to be cheap meal for inhabitants of the coasts. Development of the railway allowed to import them fresh to inland cities where they acquired status of high-class gourmet food.
</li><li> They say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> used to have a cavalry regiment meant exclusively for bringing him fresh fish.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackLondon">Jack London</a>'s stories set in the Yukon, salmon is mentioned repeatedly as mainly fit to be sled dog food, while actual settlers and Gold Rush pioneers pay exorbitant prices in hard-dug gold for any non-locally manufactured food such as eggs.
</li><li> In the U.S. lobster used to be a poor man's food (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster#History">see The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) until it was possible to ship it to urban centres, where it became a delicacy. Cod and red-fleshed bluefin tuna are going the same way nowadays due to overfishing.
<ul><li> Back in the 19th century there was a rule in most prisons not to feed lobster to the prisoners more than a few times a week, since it was considered cruel towards them.
</li><li> Although, being the 19th century, this probably refers to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAreasOfMyExpertise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAreasOfMyExpertise">furry old lobster</a> rather than the one we know now.
</li></ul></li><li> Cod is already a delicacy in Brazil, where it is highly sought after for traditional portuguese dishes. Decades ago, it was the cheapest meat available.
<ul><li> Cod stocks over the world are actually on the verge of collapse due to the <em>heavy</em> overfishing, so most mass-market cod-based dishes have long been adapted to other, cheaper and more abundant whitefish species, such as pollock, and if you want to have the real stuff you're usually in for the heavy markup.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of tuna, sushi and sashimi used to be the Japanese equivalent of fast food (fish was originally transported in vinegared rice as a preservative, and poor people buying the goods would end up eating the rice as well as the fish). Nowadays, sushi is considered fancy food, and <em>auctions</em> are held for who gets to eat bluefin tuna sashimi first, even reaching <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20919306">$1.7 million!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> While higher-quality sushi is still available at sushi restaurants, sushi is also available in supermarkets.
</li><li> Similarly, oysters were once the food of the poor in Britain (though still considered a treat). Noah Claypole the "charity-boy" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist">Oliver Twist</a> eats a large quantity.
</li><li> In the first year or two after a new species or strain of livestock comes into demand, they can be temporarily hard to come by, as their owners prefer breeding their stock for future profits over selling them now. For example, when llamas first began to see use as sheep-guards and environmentally-friendly pack animals in the United States, only gelded males were available for these purposes: breeding animals cost far too much. Ditto for exotic pets.
</li><li> Thomas Edison once declared that, "We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles", and he saw that future coming thanks in part to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">arch-rival</a>. Whilst the latter half of this boast hasn't entirely come true (generic candles are fairly cheap), it is indeed much cheaper to run a light-bulb that produces the same amount of light as an equivalent candle for the same amount of time as that candle can burn for, even if you factor in the cost of the globe itself (as it can probably continue alongside hundreds of successive candles before burning out).
<ul><li> There are candles and candles. Generic ones made with paraffin wax are cheap and readily available, but those made with beeswax are considered fancy decorations and considerably more expensive. You'd have to be <em>really</em> poor not to be able to get into a store and buy one if the desire to have it suddenly gripped you, but you won't find them used for emergency illumination in the average low-wage worker's home.
</li></ul></li><li> As the standard of living in the Developed world has risen since the middle of the 20th century the cost of labor intensive products have risen dramatically to support this standard, while technology improvement has made the cost of products that can be mass produced fall dramatically. The result is that products once made by skilled craftsmen are now virtually unobtainable, while anything produced by machines are often so cheap to be completely disposable.
<ul><li> One of the handful of exceptions to this is clothing. Cloth is an unpredictable material compared to metal and plastic, so sewing machines still require human operators. However, those operators don't have to be highly trained or educated to produce cheap, low-quality products quickly. This is why very little garment manufacture happens in the developed world.
</li></ul></li><li> For babies in America, breast milk. It means the mother is either rich enough not to work outside the home or has a good job that gives her maternity leave.
</li><li> And on the other side of the trope: Vitamin enriched puffed soy cakes? USD4.50 for a 6"x14" cylinder. Available flavors include cheese, bacon, chocolate, and probably half a dozen others (including something that probably shouldn't have used green food colouring [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">?</a>])
</li><li> An inversion is the price of meat. Until relatively recently, meat, especially red meat, was something most people would only have rarely if their farm animals died (it was more worthwhile to keep the animals alive for milk, eggs, wool to be produced consistently). Only the wealthy could afford to eat meat regularly until mass farming and refrigeration became common, lowering the price of meat, although the price may go up again as demand increases.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a> chicken were served as a special meal for important guests and "eating chicken with salad everyday" was a part of imagined upper-class life listed among diamond jewellery and silk dresses.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HerbertHoover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HerbertHoover">Herbert Hoover</a> used "A chicken in every pot" ("and a car in every garage") as an advertising slogan in the 1928 U.S. Presidential campaign. Rather ironic, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">how the Hoover administration turned out.</a> The original sentiment goes all the way back to Henry IV of France, who wrote "I want there to be no peasant in my realm so poor that he will not have a chicken in his pot on Sunday"
</li></ul></li><li> Order a soda at almost any restaurant in the U.S., and you can have it refilled as much as you like at no extra charge. The stuff is so cheap and profit margins so high that they can afford to practically give it away. On the other hand, ask for something that's reasonably healthy and natural, like fruit juice, and you'll pay for every glass. This is because the sodas come from soda fountains, which simply carbonate tap water and then mix in some small amount of concentrated syrup, while the juices (even if they're made with concentrated juice) are delivered in separate containers. The price for delivery and storage is therefore much higher (per serving) for anything but sodas. Also, this is mainly found in the US (which generally has very low food prices anyway), as restaurants in other countries usually don't miss the chance to charge a steep markup for what is basically sugared water. Outside of the States you can mainly encounter this in US-originated restaurants that simply carried this tradition with them, or in places trying to invoke an American feel, where the owners believe that the atmosphere is more important.
</li><li> And the reason <em>why</em> soda is so cheap in the US, along with candies and other sweets, is because of the invention of high-fructose corn syrup as a substitute for cane sugar that can be produced economically using the the vast (and heavily subsidized) corn crop of the American breadbasket. In the US, cane sugar is a rarity found only in organic and other specialty foods and drinks, thanks to competition from high-fructose corn syrup, a relative lack of places in the US where sugar can be grown<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18og2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18og2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18og2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast, Florida, and Hawaii</span>, and import tariffs designed to protect American sugar and corn syrup producers.
</li><li> Thanks to the invention of butter-flavored oil as an alternative to the real thing, the most expensive component of a bucket of movie-theater popcorn is, in fact, the paper bucket. Using actual butter would jack up the price considerably.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert">"Food deserts"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the developed world; neighborhoods without access to fresh food, usually in very poor, densely-populated urban areas. Grocery stores in wealthier neighborhoods or suburbs can stock fresh produce, meat, and unprocessed staples. The convenience stores that may be the only "grocery" in walking distance (those living in that area are often too poor to own a car) will favor processed, shelf-stable "food" that offers calories and little else. What little fresh food they have will be under a steep markup.
<ul><li> Again, this heavily varies with the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks">urban segregation</a> in the larger world, with many countries either not having it to the same degree, with the rich and the poor rubbing shoulders every day, or having functional public transport systems that allow the poor to affordably access the wider markets.
</li></ul></li><li> The coffee plantations in South America and Africa are known for producing some of the best coffee beans in the world, but often the farmers can only afford to drink cheap instant coffee. This also applies in the developed world. Most coffee drinkers find that pre-ground, mass produced coffee is cheaper than fresh coffee beans from local roasters roasted in small batches. The latter is mostly the province of connoisseurs, with a few diehards experimenting with home roasting, something that also used to be routine prior to the development of mass-produced coffee in the 19th century.
</li><li> Fast food menu items are based around meats like beef or chicken that used to be expensive before intensive agriculture, but fast food restaurants use meat that is of comparatively low quality.
</li><li> Because maple syrup is so laborious to produce, can only be produced during a relatively small window of late winter/early spring <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yijd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yijd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yijd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Well, okay, it <em>can</em> also be produced in late fall and early winter, but syrup produced in the fall is thought to be lower quality, because the sap is thought to be lower quality. </span>, and it takes many gallons of sap to produce even a small amount of syrup, the real thing is expensive. Pancake syrup, however, is little more than corn syrup with artificial, vaguely kinda-sorta-not-really-maple-y flavoring and caramel coloring. It can be had for as little as $1.
</li><li> Vanilla is expensive because each vanilla orchid takes a long time to reach maturity. When it does, it produces flowers that are only open for one day, and it doesn't have a lot of natural pollinators. (And if it's being grown <em>outside</em> of Central or South America, it has <em>no</em> natural pollinators.) So the flowers need to be pollinated by hand. Then, if they're successful, the beans take many months to grow to their full size, and <em>then</em> they need to be cured (otherwise, they're just bland like green beans.) This is why imitation vanilla flavoring (made from wood pulp) exists.
</li><li> Cotton is the only natural fiber that HASN'T gone through the "formerly cheap to expensive" cycle, and even it has a distinction between "regular cotton clothes" and "high-end cotton." Wool and linen are much rarer than they used to be after synthetics came around, and they take a lot of maintenance that synthetic fibers don't. In the case of wool specifically, people commonly think wool is itchy/scratchy when that's actually a sign that it's <em>inferior</em> wool, that it got washed incorrectly, or (ironically) that a "wool blend" yarn or fabric barely has any actual wool in it.
