They're going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">destroy the world</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">or at least control it</a>. Sometimes, if the writers really want it to seem like a big deal, the villain will threaten the entire galaxy, universe, or even multiple realities. It seems all hope is lost. And there's nothing the heroes can do to stop it.
</p><p>Then, suddenly, the hero will decide that he's serious. This time is for reals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">He'll whip out some until now unforeseen strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">and promptly show the villain what for</a>, usually demolishing the bad guy so completely that it prevents them from ever pulling that world threatening crap again, or at least until the writers want them back.
</p><p>This trope isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. It isn't just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon">Forgotten Superweapon</a>, and only rarely is it related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">positively sick</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">levels of training</a>. No, this trope is only really in effect when a character suddenly displays a level of power that has not even been hinted at up until its point of use. There have been no scenes depicting the character practicing towards this level, and no dialogue has given any indication that the character is aware that they are capable of it, or indeed, that they even know this level of power to be possible. They simply find themselves in need, and are subsequently capable of defeating their enemy, with no outside help whatsoever.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If any explanation is given at all, this is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> as the character having simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">held everything back up until this point</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">never mind all the dangerous, possibly near-death encounters they've most likely been through up until this point that could've really used something like this</a>.
</p><p>Another explanation is that the extra power is used only in dire emergencies because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">extremely dangerous</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">has a very limited number of uses</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">or is positively guaranteed to cause Really Bad consequences</a>. If so, it's an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>, not this trope.
</p><p>It goes the other way too. Characters can often be found struggling to defeat a particular foe, when considering their skill and compared to the baddies they faced in the past, it should be a piece of cake. Used to pad out time length with elongated fight sequences as well as to prevent the heroes from defeating a villain that the writers need for later. This conspicuous decrease in power invariably is a staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">shounen</a> filler arcs.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope does not always need to involve powers relating directly to beating the tar out of things, of course. If any hero is suddenly able to call upon powers they've never shown or hinted at before, with no explanation given by him or any other character, chances are they're Strong As They Need To Be.
</p><p>Often a result of the writers letting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> take over. If called upon to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">put a lampshade</a> on this, the character might give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fiamma of the Right explicitly has this as his power. His ability, The Holy Right, usually manifests itself as a giant bird-like claw growing out of his shoulder. The Holy Right is nearly omnipotent, but it only uses the right amount of force to accomplish what Fiamma wants at the moment. The more powerful his opponent, the more powerful it becomes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which is why, when he swings it at Touma after depriving him of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine Breaker</a> and the strike is <em>deflected</em> by the "Invisible Thing" inside his arm, he nearly goes into a panic attack because <em>that shouldn't have been possible</em>, especially since Fiamma had just obtained his power-up to become stronger than God Himself.</span>
</li><li> Touma's Imagine Breaker seems to vary in the power of what it can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">negate</a>. At one point, it manages to destroy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gungnir</span>, a divine weapon that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroys the entire universe</span> as a mere side-effect of being thrown, and Touma is left with just two broken fingers. Yet at other times, it gets overwhelmed by attacks from human magicians or espers, forcing him to deflect/redirect the attacks rather than outright negate them. The general rule of thumb seems to be that an attack that requires a constant power output, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Kamehame Hadoken</a>, is harder to negate than a simple magical object <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like the aforementioned Gungnir</span>. This is shown when he has trouble negating a massive continuous explosion of power generated by the magical weapon Curtana Original (and in fact ends up getting blown away by it), but has no problem destroying the sword itself when he actually manages to touch it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Asuka's Evangelion Unit-02 in <em>End of Evangelion</em> is only armed with a short knife and limited energy supply because of the damaged power cord, yet she manages to disarm nine mass-produced Evangelions - each with the ability to fly, and each armed with a massive greatsword <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that can turn into a replica Lance of Longinus and ignore any AT Field</span> - with only 20 seconds for each. Prior to that, she had already wiped out a small army of a battleships, several tank battalions, a couple of artillery brigades, a few more VTOL gunships, and tanking an N2 Missile. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the mass-produced Evas regenerate and gang up on the downed Unit-02.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> (particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>), this is very common. One character is beaten, and a few moments later (without any chance of training), he is so much stronger that he can beat the guy who has just defeated him without even sweating. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> for the Saiyans after the first arc with a technique called "Zenkai", basically that "Saiyans get stronger after being put near death". More often than not, Zenkai gets a Saiyan to equal or slightly exceed the power of the next opponent they face. That opponent then often reveals another form, and beats them again.
</li><li> Fusions and transformations generally make a character strong enough to exceed the biggest threat currently out there. Either their opponent then gets a transformation, or that's the last fight of an arc.
</li><li> The majority of training characters go through is done offscreen or over time (at least in the manga), and the end result of it is generally that they gain as much power as needed to be relevant, interesting to watch, or able to stall until Goku or Gohan enters the fight.
</li><li> Goku directly invoked this trope in the Buu Saga, using up the rest of his time on Earth to force himself to a ridiculously high <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">hold off the villain long enough for Trunks to escape.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1scjy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1scjy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1scjy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Notable in that this is the closest a dead guy can come to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> It seems that every arc gives a separate explanation for why Ichigo's power is inconsistent. Originally, it was said that he couldn't control his power because he hadn't been properly trained. Later on, it's said that his power levels are linked to his resolve to win. Once he had better learned to control his power, villains learned to exploit his fluctuating resolve by beating down his self-confidence by demonstrating their greater power or revealing a few carefully chosen truths about his friends or family that he didn't know. Eventually, he caught on to this tactic and verbally chewed out the next villain who tried it. Then in the "Lost Substitute" arc, it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his substitute badge was suppressing his reiatsu, because the high brass of the Shinigami were worried that they couldn't fully trust him, and that the previous substitute would turn him against the Soul Society.</span> And finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final arc claims that the real reason his power fluctuated so much is because his "Shinigami" power, known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">Old Man Zangetsu,</a> was actually his <em>Quincy</em> power, secretly masquerading as his Shinigami power and only permitting him to access just enough to survive. When he and Zangetsu confronted each other about it, Ichigo learned that his true Shinigami power was the Inner Hollow that had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind">trained him in an antagonistic way.</a> Once he had accepted both spirits as his weapon, his power levels stabilised for the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the story.</span>
</li><li> When Kenpachi and Ichigo fight, their spiritual power initially matches. Feeling he lost the fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Yachiru</a> tells Kenpachi they'll grow stronger together, and every fight after this shows that he is indeed stronger. When he comes close to death against Nnoitra, he suddenly powers up enough to defeat Nnoitra after appearing to do nothing more than swing his sword two-handed. It's eventually revealed that Kenpachi gains a power-up every time he's brought to the point of death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As a child, he was so powerful that when he met his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, he was so terrified of killing them and ending his first enjoyable fight that he subconsciously shackled his power.

<ul><li> While <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maka's weapon form</span> was certainly an example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kid's Sanzu Lines</span> were nothing new if you read the manga-the alternate ending is to blame, here.

The way he fights tends to be ludicrously inefficient against weaker opponents, though, which provides a legitimate flaw for somebody who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> to exploit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: This tends to be played for laughs. Luffy defeats Arlong in the previous arc, who was the most powerful pirate in the East Blue. Yet he's easily restrained by Buggy and his mooks for his "execution" despite showing displays of super-strength and persistence.
<ul><li> The most glaring example is the Davy Back Fight Arc. Last arc, Luffy defeated Enel, an extremely skilled fighter who used one of the most powerful Devil Fruits ever seen. In the Davy Back Fight, he has trouble with Foxy, who, even if one takes into account his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> status, is indeed extremely weaker than Enel.
<ul><li> This is because, Enel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">at an extreme disadvantage due to Luffy's rubber body</a> and Foxy's Devil Fruit is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>: his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Slow-Slow Fruit</a> not only decreases the relative speed of what he fires at, it also adds on top the combined accumulated damage delivered once the motion is back in sync with the rest of the environment.

Until you attack it (while it's in attack position), and it gains attack points equal to the Atk of the monster attacking <em>it</em>. So, attack it with a mediocre 1500-Atk monster, and it'll have 1600 Atk points, destroying the weaker monster. Attack it with a gargantuan 5000-atk point monster, and it'll have 5100 Atk points.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the beginning, Superman was <em>only</em> "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound". However, his power levels gradually crept upwards during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">the Golden Age</a> until he was strong enough to move planets, faster than light and able to fly through an exploding nova unharmed. In 1986 his power was nerfed (he could "only" move mountains, for example) in order to allow him to believably fight small-time thugs, but the writers forgot about his new limitations as soon as they needed him to fly anywhere faster than light or breathe in space.
</li><li> Even with the Post-Crisis Superman, some writers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a> is a good example) like to write him as a being of godlike power, capable of surviving things like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the super-nuke</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em> that would kill literally anyone else.
</li><li> Some stories suggest that, like Hulk, Supes' power level is affected by his mood. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ForTheManWhoHasEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ForTheManWhoHasEverything">For the Man Who Has Everything</a></em>, he was so mad at Mongul that he actually wanted to kill him, and he went absolutely apeshit on him. Mongul is normally stronger than Supes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> -and her alternate counterpart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a>- is usually treated as the equal to Superman, but depending on the story she may be more powerful or clearly weaker (she's consistently been depicted as faster since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, though). Her powers fluctuate depending on who she's fighting... or her opponent's level of <em>popularity</em>. So, in <em>Wonder Woman</em> Vol. 1 #177 she easily manhandles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, whereas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2011">H'el on Earth</a></em> Diana disables Kara after a lengthy struggle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a> -Kon-El- has fallen victim to this, too. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, Kon gets curbstomped and killed off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SuperboyPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/SuperboyPrime">Superboy-Prime</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a>: Legion of 3 Worlds</em> comes out, and Kon tanks all of his attacks.
</li><li> Speaking about Superboy-Prime, in <em>Infinity Crisis</em> he murders dozens of Titans, beats Earth-Two Superman to death and he's only barely stopped by New Earth Superman after being weakened. In later stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinestroCorpsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinestroCorpsWar">Sinestro Corps War</a></em> and the abovementioned <em>Final Crisis</em> he's easily punched out by any member of the Super-Family, and he's knocked down by a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a> in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrimeOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrimeOfLife">Prime Of Life</a></em> storyline.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanSamuelKent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanSamuelKent">Jonathan Samuel Kent</a>'s strength tends to vary based on how strong the plot needs him to be. For instance, he can lift a car over his head in one issue but has trouble breaking iron chains in another. This becomes particularly glaring after the <em>Black Dawn</em> arc, where he's strong enough to stop a train with ease, but Damian can still punch him hard enough to feel pain. Sometimes justified by the fact that as a Half-Kryptonian, he has to hold back or he'll splatter normal people with a regular punch.
</li><li> It happens to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a></em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBlackRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBlackRing">The Black Ring</a></em>. Luthor's battlesuit allows him to face Slade, Larfleeze, and finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a>. In each case, the suit seems just strong enough to allow Luthor to battle his adversary of the moment. Of course, it's possible they are different models.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> frequently invokes this trope, with the idea that he was "holding back" for fear that unleashing his true power would kill his opponent. Almost always accompanied by a line such as "Now you must face the full might of Thor!" Thor states that even against superhuman foes on Earth, he doesn't dare use his full strength for fear of killing them. There's clearly some ego involved in this, of course, since Earth has some superhumans who are every bit as strong and durable as Thor, if not moreso (see: Hulk, Juggernaut, Hercules, Sentry, etc). Though during the Mutant Massacre he got so angry he <em>did</em> kill the super-strong Blockbuster (who might not have been "Class 100" level but was clearly no pushover) with a single blow, so he's not just blowing smoke, either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers">JLA/Avengers</a></em>, Superman and Thor are as strong as the plot requires. Thor can take on Superman and the Martian Manhunter simultaneously in the first fight (actually he was overpowered), but Superman alone can knock him out (even so, Thor claims in the last issue that he has a good idea of how powerful Superman is and could possibly beat him in another fight). In the final battle, Superman defeats Count Nefaria, a villain who can take on Thor and the entire Avengers team at once (at least we see Superman confront the Count, so for all we know he could have had help). Rising to the challenge, Thor defeats Doomsday, who is famous for killing Superman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a>'s word is that Thor only knocked Doomsday off the panel, not that he was actually defeated.
</li><li> What powers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> has, and to what degree, varies enormously with who's writing him and the needs of the current story. He seems to have all and only the abilities he needs to put the story where the writer wants it. Sometimes he's like a combination of Superman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a> (except weaker), and other times he is the most powerful being on Earth (as in a storyline where he turned evil and everyone was terrified of fighting him). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">zombie</a> MM points out "I'm as powerful as Superman. Why does everyone FORGET that?" before kicking some ass. For that matter, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a> toward fire is alternately treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a> that keeps him from being too overpowered, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">psychosomatic</a> weakness that can be overcome with willpower; the two inconsistencies go hand in hand.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OMAC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OMAC">OMACs</a> are an interesting case. They're villains, which is unusual for this trope, and Strong As They Need To Be is their explicitly stated ability. When they sight a superhero, they'll identify the hero and reconfigure to have the powers and abilities they need to win the fight. Nearly everyone has asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the obvious question</a>, which is: Why are the bad guys going out of their way to give the heroes a fair chance? Why don't they just configure themselves with the Superman-killing abilities and lay waste to everyone? No answer has yet been given. Fan theories quite naturally abound; for example, as machine-based creatures, it's been suggested that it would take far more energy for them to hit someone as hard as Superman could <em>all the time</em> than to reconfigure into more limited forms. The fact that the Infinite Crisis Brother Eye was made by Batman would explain a lot. (Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">the real reason</a> is so that O.M.A.C.s could believably pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkiesCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkiesCrossover">Red Skies Crossover</a> with any hero on the roster, even near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> ones.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>'s level of physical might and durability varies tremendously. This one, however, has a built-in explanation: Hulk's physical might—and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk">the 2003 movie</a>, his physical mass and size—is directly related to how angry he gets. Hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> "The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets." For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> has fought him several times—most of the time to a standstill until he manages to get one good cut in and piss the Hulk off enough that his anger really flares up. At the same time, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Onslaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Onslaught">Onslaught</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">event</a>, in the last battle with the titular villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> mentally removed any blocks Banner may have had to restrain himself, and he beat the hell out of the physical form of a being that could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">alter reality with a thought</a>. In short: hope your first punch knocks him out. Similarly to Darwin below, in one story Hulk developed the ability to breathe in space by getting angry enough.
<ul><li> Another factor is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">which</a></em> Hulk's shown up, as different Hulks have different strength levels, though even Grey Hulk/Joe Fixit, who's usually considered weaker than his other selves, is still formidable in a fight.
</li></ul></li><li> Many mutants from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> have to cope with this, heroes and villains alike:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is a prime example of this. It ranges in effectiveness from merely a slightly accelerated form of ordinary healing (needing days to heal from relatively minor injuries) to full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> level (being able to regenerate himself from just a bit of brain marrow or a blood smear).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.marvel.com/universe/Darwin">Darwin, the Evolving Boy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> literally has this trope as his superpower. Whenever placed in a situation he is unsuited for, he will gain a new power capable of dealing with it. Place him in total darkness and he gets the power to see in the dark. Stick him in a burning building and he becomes immune to fire. Trap him underwater and he grows gills. It will not, however, give him an instant 'I Win' button for every fight. An often mentioned example is when they tried to get him to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">Green Scar Hulk</a>: instead of gaining something to match or negate his powers, Darwin's powers instead teleported him to the next state over to get away from the Hulk. His power is to evolve whatever he needs to <em>survive</em>, not necessarily to <em>win</em>. Although he can sometimes maneuver himself into a situation where his power is forced to give him the specific adaptation he wants, he has no direct control over it.
</li><li> Similar to Darwin is another X-recruit named Lifeguard, whose mutant power is to gain the ability she needs to save <em>others.</em> No telling whether or not that ability will be something that will keep <em>her</em> safe or defeat the enemy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> is subject to this as part and parcel of his powers — unlike most X-characters he is not a mutant, and his powers are of a mystical nature instead, being granted to him by a malevolent extradimensional being called Cyttorak. Cyttorak is an avatar of death and destruction, so his gift waxes and wanes depending on how evil his chosen Exemplar is at any given time. As a character often caught in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a>, this is used to explain why Juggernaut <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion">always tends to be weaker as a hero than he ever is as a villain</a>.
</li><li> The Strontians Gladiator (of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard) and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">female version</a> Xenith are a race of aliens with powers very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s, but dependent in strength on their confidence level. At full confidence Gladiator has effortlessly pimp-slapped the Juggernaut, moved planets and crisscrossed the galaxy at faster-than-light speeds. But if they feel even a small amount of fear, doubt or regret, they get weaker, which has led to some truly humiliating defeats for both over the years.
</li><li> Much like the Strontians, the powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> villain Exodus are also tied to his mental state. Specifically, he draws strength from his faith and the faith of others around him in himself. When empowered by the awe of hundreds of Genoshan mutants Exodus was powerful enough to throw down with two whole teams of Avengers and X-Men and dispatch both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">literally</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">with one hand</a>. When in doubt, though, he is much less effective, as seen when he reluctantly allied himself with the much more evil Mr. Sinister in 2008's <em>Messiah Complex</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Amazons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack">Amazons Attack!</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s people invaded the United States seemed to fluctuate wildly in their power. In one scene they're giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> a hard time, then Superman shows up and trounces them effortlessly, then they're taking down fighter jets with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">flying horses and spears</a>, Batman can beat them in a straight up fight, they can invade Washington DC and the army can't do a thing to stop them, then they get shot down by soldiers. They're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, and they beat the US army with spears and giant bees <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23ywr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23ywr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23ywr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Stygian Killer Hornets, thank you... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Bees. My God</a></span>!?
<ul><li> Wonder Woman herself is often subject to this. She can either be as strong as Superman or weaker than him (and even then by how much will vary). Her Lasso of Truth can either be unbreakable or be broken by incredibly strong opponents. And then there is her weakness to bullets which comes and goes at the writers' whims.
</li></ul></li><li> Solomon Grundy, a regular villain in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> is either strong enough to take on Superman or easily beaten by the likes of Green Arrow and Batman depending on the needs of the story.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> has this problem very often. His strength, while theoretically possible to mathematically calculate, is subject to plenty of fluctuation. Even his webbing is subject to this, sometimes being broken by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and sometimes strong enough to hold up a car or two.
<ul><li> The ultimate expression of this was when he was attacked by Firelord. Panicking, dodging, and running for his life, he sees the Herald of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> survive everything he can throw at him unharmed, up to and including an exploding gas station. But when two kids nearly get killed by his uncaring foe, Spidey loses his cool - and proceeds to pound Firelord into the pavement, punctuating every barrage of fists with statements on the order of "Hey, you don't attack kids!" It takes the arrival of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> to snap him out, by which time Firelord is flat on his back, eyes crossed, and dazed for quite a while. Just to elaborate, this is a being on a power level roughly equal to Thor or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a>, and leagues above the power level of Spidey or any of his usual foes.
</li><li> On at least two occasions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> has been trapped under tons of debris when someone's life was at stake. On those occasions he was able to tap into a reserve of strength that allowed him to lift the debris off him, all the while disbelieving it ("Come on, Thor couldn't lift this...the Hulk couldn't lift this!").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom">Venom</a> also goes through this, ranging from only being a little bit stronger than Spidey himself to being able to match the Juggernaut blow for blow. This is actually part of Venom (Mac Gargan)'s powers; when injured or threatened, the symbiote can increase in mass and strength to meet whatever threat it is fighting with equal force.
</li><li> Subverted when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a> happened to be in a similar situation, with evil god Set trapping every superhero on Earth under an unbreakable forcefield. May was doing everything she could to beat him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">even dropping a building on him didn't slow him down</a>. However, when May called all her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a> for one final attack and it was looking like this trope was going to be used....<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">she kicked him in the nuts</a>. After that, Set admitted that he was holding back on her. Unluckily for him, that kick was painful enough to make him stop upholding the force field and release the superheroes, who unleashed a giant ass-kicking upon him.
</li><li> Also applies to the Spider Sense. Sometimes it allows Spidey to see and avoid multiple attacks and enemies coming from any direction, in the dark, while blinded, even while barely conscious, other times Peter will just stand there saying "spider sense tingling!" until he gets hit, and occasionally it won't go off at all even when it should.
<ul><li> This can be seen as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel">Don't Think, Feel</a>. When he allows his spider sense to guide him, he can dance around enemies. When he tries to focus on what is causing it, his reaction speed decreases. Interestingly, one side story showed that his spider sense is always going off a little bit because of all the random dangers around us that we don't notice. Except when he is freefalling while webswinging.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">The Inheritors</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon">Spider-Geddon</a></em> exist in a perpetual state of "Stronger than Spider-Man or anyone near him." It is extremely unclear what exactly that means or what their upper limits are and it begs the question of why doesn't Spider-Man ask for some help from Marvel's Heavy Hitters to take them out?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing">The Thing</a> is another character whose strength has actual limits and there are some foes that he simply cannot overpower. Although we pretty much have to be <em>told</em> this for this to be true; at one point he was even asked point blank how strong he was and his answer was "STRONG ENOUGH!" That said, he does have one long-standing solid limitation: he's not as strong as the Hulk.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> pretty much stated this trope when responding to comments of his writing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a>. Fanboys were quibbling about She-Hulk's power level under PAD's run and he said she'd be as strong as the story required - as the story was more important than the stats.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics">Christopher Priest</a> mentioned this when writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a>'s solo series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, Panther can hold his own against the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> and even trade blows with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing">The Thing</a>, or be overpowered and beaten unconscious by random muggers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>. What makes it worse is that the Black Panther's costume is lined with vibranium (the same stuff Captain America's shield is made of), which means he should be able to shrug off blows that would wound or knock out a normal man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> has the character Nemesis Kid, whose power is exactly this. He develops abilities strong enough to deal with anyone he's directly fighting. If he fights a martial artist, his skills will be superior, if he fights a cosmic powerhouse, his strength will go through the roof. Naturally the only way to defeat him is to go after him in pairs because he can only adapt to one power at a time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He dies at the hands of Princess Projectra, not a particularly strong fighter, whose only ability is casting illusions.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, whose healing powers are literally taken from Wolverine, has his own healing ability fluctuate wildly depending on how powerful they need to be for the plot. This is explained away as a result of the constant battle between his cancer and his healing powers, as sometimes the cancer gains ground and sometimes the healthy cells gain ground. It even becomes a major plot point when his healing factor stays in a weakened state and he seeks medical attention to try and improve it. He is literally immortal though, since after meeting Death herself when he was having near death experiences he fell in love with her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> became jealous of Deadpool and prevents his soul from passing on so they can never be together.

At best, it's bad-karaoke level, where other people find it annoying and embarrassing but also quite funny (like in <em>Asterix the Gaul</em>, <em>Asterix and the Falling Sky</em>, <em>Asterix and The Big Fight</em>, and a few throwaway scenes where he's needed to sing for a pun without interrupting the plot); it's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckinessIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckinessIsPainful">Suckiness Is Painful</a> (<em>Asterix and the Gladiator</em>, <em>The Mansions of the Gods</em>, and most of the throwaway scenes with him in books where he isn't plot important); but if necessary he can also be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers (edging into this in <em>Asterix and the Normans</em> where his singing is said to be the essence of true fear, possibly <em>Asterix and the Soothsayer</em> where his singing may be causing the Gods to strike the village with lightning, but especially <em>Asterix and the Magic Carpet</em> where he can create rain indoors and <em>Asterix and the Secret Weapon</em> where he's working on a song so bad that it creates an apocalyptic thunderstorm and terrifies all animal life from the forest, including a dragon). Some of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">Sequel Escalation</a>, especially early on when Goscinny was still working out what was funny about each character, but it zigzags quite a lot - it's weird to go from him being a borderline abomination in <em>Secret Weapon</em> to performing under a beautiful, cloudless starry sky with only a little annoyance from the other villagers in <em>Falling Sky</em>.
</li><li> He then goes all the way to the opposite extreme, which he'd never been seen in before, in <em>Asterix And Obelix's Birthday</em>, where he becomes an unusually <em>good</em> singer for a page <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">in order for some gags to work</a>. During that sequence he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroupieBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroupieBrigade">Groupie Brigade</a> of screaming teen girls who love his music, big-selling albums (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticEra">in 50BC</a>), and is the respected, feared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CausticCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CausticCritic">Caustic Critic</a> judging a reality-show-like singing contest. Other bards in the same scene are shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessAuditionees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessAuditionees">Hopeless Auditionees</a> who are far worse than he is. The mere existence of someone worse than Cacofonix is unthinkable in most of his other stories.
</li><li> The potion's effects and dosage are all over the place. For instance, Obelix gets three drops of magic potion in <em>Asterix and Cleopatra</em> to boost his strength such that he can pummel his way out of a pyramid, and claims he notices no difference (a later story establishes a dose large enough to work on him would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned him to stone</a>). However, in a later story, a barrel of potion gets spilled into the sea, causing all the fish in the Channel to be superpowered enough to savage the fishermen trying to catch them, even though the concentration must be much, much lower. In <em>Asterix and Obelix All At Sea</em> the potion is used to restore Asterix from a severely injured state after losing a fight, despite having no technical healing powers. On top of that, the relative effectiveness of larger doses over smaller doses is flipflopped since the plot of <em>Asterix and the Olympic Games</em> is centered on the fact that everyone who's taken potion becomes equally strong and equally fast, regardless of their real capabilities. Maybe it's homeopathic?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em>: Jerom often showcases previously unknown powers that will help the plot move forward more easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>: All the Flashes don't seem to use their speed as much as they can. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a> once emptied the city of Chongjin, North Korea, which has 532,000 people, by carrying every citizen out of the borders, one at a time, in <em>0.0001 microsecond</em>. He <em>began</em> the rescue <em>after</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear bomb</a> had been detonated in the city and carried them all miles away to safety, so fast that they seemed to have been teleported. This indicates that he is trillions of times faster than light. Anyone capable of that level of speed should essentially be invincible. However, occasionally he get hit by enemies much slower then him; for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> infamously stabbed him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em>.
</li><li> This trope is actually used to describe the power of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em> characters Gotham and Gotham Girl, introduced in the <em>Batman</em> storyline "I Am Gotham". The brother-sister duo are given powers by Dr. Hugo Strange that fluctuate depending on who they're facing. This is easily shown in the finale when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> Gotham is beaten bloody by Batman, yet when the entire Justice League, whose numbers include two Green Lanterns and the pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> Superman, show up, he tears them apart. The downside of this is that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, meaning that they're going to die when it's all used up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gotham ended up dying earlier as Gotham Girl is forced to put him down.</span>

This doesn't guarantee them a win, though, only makes the fight fair. It's also not fully clear how it works or if it has any limits; a peasant wearing the mask was able to duel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackKnightMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackKnightMarvelComics">Sir Percy of Scandia</a> to a standstill, for example, but it's not clear whether a wearer facing, say, Galactus would suddenly have enormous cosmic powers.

His healing powers are inexplicably multiplied to the point where he can walk up to Phoenix (who by this point had already atomized several main characters and the entirety of Alcatraz island), taking multiple psychic blasts which flay the muscles from his bones only to fully regenerate in less than a second. Keep in mind that this version of Wolverine took some time to heal from a single gunshot or being hit by a log. This was so egregious that it got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>, stating that Phoenix's out-of-control abilities also amplified the powers of nearby mutants.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>'s power varies from film to film. Sometimes, he's able to defeat enemies with a single breath of his atomic breath, while others, he struggles in a tooth-N-claw battle against his enemies. Most of this is explained by many of the movies being set in one of several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a>, so they would be different versions of Godzilla. Still, particularly in the later Showa era, Godzilla usually suffers a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">Curbstomp Battle</a> in round one, and then inexplicably bounces back more powerful than before. During his "second wind" he will be able to counter or outright ignore the attacks that caused him severe injury the first time. While Godzilla does have regeneration as one of his powers, the speed and convenience of these turnarounds is still somewhat odd. The best example of this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsGigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsGigan">Godzilla vs. Gigan</a></em>, where Godzilla gains a true second wind after being beaten to the point of being little more than rag doll in Gigan and King Ghidorah's claws, to turning the entire battle around after being thrown into a building and smashing it. A variant of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzilla">Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla</a></em> which had him gain a new power (temporarily) to get a good grip on his foe.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PumaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PumaMan">Puma Man</a></em>, in which the "superhero" is capable of tearing apart a car or ripping into a brick wall with his bare hands, but at the movie's climax is just <em>barely</em> able to overpower an elderly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a> in a struggle.

</li><li> David in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em> has a version of this, but the trope is played with in that he was middle aged before he noticed. While he is quite strong in the normal sense it's because he lifts weights as part of his normal exercise routine, and the amount he lifts is set to where it provides decent resistance but isn't likely to actually hurt himself. Thanks to the events of the movie he has reason to suspect that he's stronger than he thinks and makes an attempt to find his actual bench limit, only to find that he's still straining the same amount no matter how much weight he ads.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AQuietPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AQuietPlace">A Quiet Place</a></em>: The aliens are shown to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpClaws">Absurdly Sharp Claws</a> that can claw through a metal silo like tissue, but when the kids hide in the truck, the monster is not able to get in, even though the truck would have thinner metal than the silo.

This matches the rules for slayers on the tabletop, but in his case it seems to affect his actual skill as well.
</li><li> Done well, and justified, in a fight scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy">Too Many Magicians</a></em>: Lord Ashley is dueling a villain whose sword is enchanted, and keeps flickering in and out of visibility. As he's pressed hard by his foe's invisible attacks, Ashley's fear activates his own power of prescience, allowing him to intuit exactly where the blade will strike next. This turns the tables on the villain, who begins a fighting retreat ... at which point, Lord Ashley's growing confidence causes his prescient power to shut down again, as it's established that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">only works when he's under stress</a>. Luckily for him, his opponent doesn't realize that's what happened, and when Ashley hesitates, his foe seizes the opportunity to escape rather than attack.
</li><li> This happens on both sides of the fence in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> fiction. Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Chaos Space Marines</a> or other alien enemies of the Imperium require a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Imperial Guard</a> cannon fodder to be hurled at them before they die. Then you have series like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett">Dan Abnett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em>, where the killing of Chaos Space Marines is almost-but-not-quite offhanded.
<ul><li> This is often true of the loyalists as well.
</li><li> Gaunt's group <em>did</em> shoot them in the back from ambush while they were utterly massacring another Imperial unit.
</li><li> Orcs get this treatment a lot too. Sometimes they are almost a joke and a minor threat to guardsmen unless they have a huge numbers advantage, and sometimes the same kind will be a difficult fight to Space Marines one-on-one. Same applies to Tyranids.
<ul><li> Orcs are a special case. A feral Ork army is almost laughable in terms of strength, while a carefully constructed WAAAGH! is almost unstoppable. Often, you'll see something in between the two. The strength of the Orks depends on the strength of the local WAAAGH! It's a species that runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>, thus this trope is easily justified. The writer just has to limit how hard they can "clap."
</li><li> The strength of <em>their opponent</em> is also a crucial factor. Orks are a survivor race. When they face a more powerful and able opponent they will be just as tough, whereas if the opponent is incompetent they wont be any worse, but they'll not be any better than they would normally be. Comparing Orks between stories, or in certain games such as Gorkamorka, where they don't have as much of a dedicated opponent, the contrast is rather striking.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly justifiable in cases where the story is about different chapters/regiments/hives/etc. as experience plays a big part in war.
</li><li> The Imperial Guard often suffer from the inverse form of this trope being as Weak As They Need To Be. Their performance will be pitched at a level where they are being beaten and thus need rescue by the heroes of the story but not being so badly outclassed that those few heroes can't make the difference between defeat and victory. Thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, the Imperial Guard will either be a [[Badassarmy competent force]] that is led by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">grizzled veteran</a> and uses modern, combined-arms tactics, or they'll be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">Red Shirt Army</a> that's led by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">incompetent glory-hound or armchair noble who bought the rank</a> and throws men into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WW1</a>-esque meat-grinder slaughters. That second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">Red Shirt Army</a> depiction is usually reserved for stories where the Space Marines are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a>. Go figure.
</li></ul></li><li> This inconsistency is one of the complaints against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ">World War Z</a></em>'s zombies. Zombies which can shrug off overpressure created by artillery and tank blasts have absolutely no business being killed by small arms or plucky civilians' melee attacks.
</li><li> This is an explicit rule in Diane Duane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a> series. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a> ensure that every wizard has enough power to deal with whatever the current crisis is. Luckily, drama is preserved by making failure a real option; just because you're <em>strong</em> enough to solve the problem doesn't mean you'll figure out the solution, or want to pay the price. This is also why older wizards tend to be weaker than their younger counterparts. Their skill with magic is such that they don't <em>need</em> as much power.
</li><li> The supervillain Lung, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em> has this as an explicit power. The longer he fights the stronger he becomes, slowly morphing from a man into an enormous unstoppable dragon. When given enough time, he can fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Endbringers</a> one on one. He's taken out by Taylor in the first arc, serving as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a>, due to being defeated before he has time to become too powerful to defeat.

Additionally, some vampires are shown to be able to bend steel bare-handed, while others have been held back by wooden doors.
<ul><li> When asked about the strength of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">replied</a>, literally "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">as strong as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">the plot needs her to be</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> tended to do this a lot as well. Particularly notable with Connor, whose abilities seemed to correspond directly to how inconvenient it would be. When he's on their side, he gets beaten up by practically everything not an ordinary vampire. When fighting against them, he took out almost the entire team single-handedly, twice.
<ul><li> But then again, he ended a threat that had lasted for an entire season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by punching a hole in the face of an "evil" goddess</span>. Because he was the only one awake who could.
</li></ul></li><li> The Turok-Han vampires in <em>Buffy</em> season 7 also seem to suffer from this.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> started suffering from this once the showrunners ran out of written material from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> books and having to rely on their own writing abilities. Prominent examples included:
<ul><li> Arya Stark's mutation into an inconsistent Faceless Man washout who could only flee from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">the Waif</a> one episode, then inexplicably survive fifteen stab wounds and kill the Waif in the very next episode.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen's dragons (all of them) were untouchable engines of destruction in Essos. Then they reached Westeros and... well, were <em>still</em> engines of destruction that could shrug off hits from giant crossbow bolts. Then they suddenly became vulnerable to spears and giant crossbow bolts and in very short order three dragons were reduced to one dragon. And then in the penultimate episode the one remaining dragon is back to an unstoppable engine of destruction that annihilates the entire enemy force solo despite enormous numbers of said giant crossbows.
</li><li> The Night King spent six seasons as the greatest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater Scope Villains</a> in the series and was promised to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictKiller">Conflict Killer</a> that would either force all of Westeros's royal houses to unite against him or be slaughtered by him. His combat performances in those seasons lived up to this overpowering menace... until he reached Winterfell and was effortlessly killed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arya Stark</span>.
</li><li> This trope even began being applied to <em>intelligence</em>, with traditional series masterminds such as Littlefinger, Varys, and Tyrion Lannister devolving from consistent schemers to being As Smart As They Need To Be, or as dumb since all three characters starting making colossal mistakes left, right and center to facilitate killing them off or neutering their effectiveness and plot importance.

As suddenly they're pummeling the previously-unbeatable foe, Red triumphantly cries out that consistent power levels <em>do not exist!</em> Yeah, it's that kinda series.
<ul><li> It's most on display in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em> and other crossover occasions.

In short... Akiba Red knows what he's talking about.
</li><li> It's most ridiculous in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> franchise, where Riders will have officially published stats like running speed, jumping height, and punching and kicking power. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The manual</a> (sometimes a literal one!

Count on <em>absolutely none of it</em> to be adhered to in any actual episode.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, Clark flies up to Apokolips, a planet with engines on it, and shoves it all the way back into space saving the day and exhibiting about a billion times the super strength he's ever demonstrated in the TV series. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> level power for Superman and even that character was normally moving inert planets when he moved something that massive. Possibly justified, as Apokolips was said to have been drawn to Earth by humanity's despair, amplified by Darkseid's corruption. However because Clark became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">beacon of hope</a>, he was able to eradicate Darkseid's influence, severely weakening Apokolips in the process.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">vampirized</span> Hunter Gordon Walker was strong enough to rip off two vampire's heads and could even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill his partner with his bare hands</span>, but when fighting Sam, his strength appeared to be downgraded.
<ul><li> Castiel tends to fall in to this as well, likely because he's so powerful the writers feel they need to gimp him to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a> relevant. In his first appearance in season 4, he's described as "cosmic" and both the heroes and villains seem to think he's more powerful than anything they've encountered. Half a season later, he gets his ass kicked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Alistair</a>. In season 5, he's cut off from Heaven and gradually loses his powers, however the order he loses them in doesn't make much sense (his healing is gone by the second episode, yet he's still able to <em>time travel</em> halfway through the season). In season 6, he gets his powers back, but major villain Eve is somehow able to nullify them by virtue of being older than he is. The writers tried to reverse this in season 7 by making the leviathans even stronger than angels, but due to them displaying far less power and routinely getting their asses kicked by humans, demons and ghosts (all of which are much weaker than angels) this came off as a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Flash has already been mentioned in the comics section, but rest assured the situation is no different on the small screen! In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>, we get scenes with the STAR Labs gang where his top speed is being calculated and we are told outright what it is. However, outrunning <em>lightning</em> in an early episode is a feat far beyond the speeds we're being told is his max. <em>However</em> however, being faster than lightning should mean nobody with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Freeze Ray</a> or the ability to copy himself should ever stand a chance against him. In one episode he'll be so fast that an entire episode takes place in the time it takes a nuclear explosion that has already happened to travel a few feet, sometimes even moving at super speed <em>compared to that</em> (as in, the world, explosion included, is still totally frozen to the viewer, but Barry, Jay, and Jesse will zip around the way they can when we're seeing things normally - super speed <em>squared!</em>) In future episodes he's back to running straight into villains' fists as if he couldn't see it coming.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">The Doctor</a> is a common offender. In some episodes, he can literally <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/gsfKyhAK6j8?t=130">move faster than laser fire.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> While in others, he gets cold cocked by an ordinary person.
</li><li> Iago from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EstoyVivo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EstoyVivo">Estoy Vivo</a></em> is a particularly blatant example. In his best days, he can dodge bullets, perform impossible acrobatics and wipe the floor with dozens of Walkway agents who are presumably the same level as him, while in his <em>worst</em> days, three human mafiosos are enough to capture him without allowing him to put up a fight.

This was also initially the case after he returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>: Cataclysm</em>, as he fought the Life Aspect Alexstrasza in the Twilight Highlands and, while Deathwing won, the fight was fairly even and both of them were severely injured by the end of it. It's later revealed that Deathwing was saturated with dark energies to such an extent that he was effectively unkillable even by entities like Alexstrasza and the other Aspects. In order to wipe his matter from existence and kill him for good, you need a much greater amount of power delivered in a much briefer assault—so they grab the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Dragon Soul</a> from the past, supercharge it with more power than it's ever had, attune it to Deathwing so it can harm him, and get Thrall to fire it at him... and even then, it takes multiple shots.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>'s speed is very inconsistent from game to game. At Sonic's best he's fast enough to outrun planes, rockets, missiles, <em>black holes</em>, etc. while at his worst Sonic can't catch an obese scientist fleeing from him on foot. Of course, if you believe the implication that he almost never uses his full speed save for VERY special circumstances just to challenge himself, this is justified.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>'s ability to activate witch time seems to be on when the plot needs her to have it. She can activate it for minutes at a time at will with no cost; during normal gameplay she needs to precisely dodge attacks or use magical energy with a device. It is, however, universally accepted that she always plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">the other spectrum of this trope</a>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem">where's the fun in going full blast all the time?</a>
</li><li> How high and how far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a> is capable of jumping varies from game to game and whether or not he is under player control at the time. For instance, Mario will be unable to jump over obstacles unaided if at all that he would have been more than capable of jumping over unaided in other games, and/or still not be able to do the same despite demonstrating the ability to jump significantly higher than said obstacles in cutscenes or in battle in the very same game.
<ul><li> The biggest fluctuation occurs between the RPGs and the platformers. In the platformers, Mario has to depend on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a> to beat Bowser; in the RPGs, he can beat Bowser with nothing but the clothes on his back.
</li><li> Bowser himself is usually depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, yet often demonstrates jumping prowess that Mario could never dream of, among other feats. His actual size and strength also varies tremendously, as does his actual confidence. Princess Peach herself has demonstrated athleticism compared to Mario as well as vaguely-defined magical powers at points, yet when Bowser comes a-calling she's suddenly completely helpless. In general, it's safe to say that the game informs how capable the characters are more than anything else.

<ul><li> Due to the emphasis on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, the team's powers and abilities were considerably up and down. One infamous example was the case where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">superpowerless</a> Boy Wonder was able to singlehandedly beat down Cinderblock, with his bare hands. Every other time however, Robin and his teammates struggled to defeat him. The Titans often reached literal godlike levels during the season finales.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>'s little trick of reassembling himself after Brother Blood literally took him apart in a fight. This was so ridiculous that the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">included a line of dialogue</a> stating that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">a one time thing</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven">Raven</a>'s strength fluctuations are legendary. In some cases she's been beaten by just having her mouth forced shut, but when the plot calls for it she's capable of soloing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> father. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> because Raven's powers are fueled by her emotions; the more passionate she becomes about defeating an enemy, the stronger her powers become in order to accomplish it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire">Starfire</a> is pretty bad about this trope. She can survive extreme environments when the plot calls for it, and be totally helpless when it doesn't. In one episode, Starfire winds up wandering around frozen tundra, apparently in danger of freezing to death. Given her super speed and flight abilities, there was nothing in that episode stopping her from flying out of the area, or back to Titans Tower to get proper equipment if things get too hairy. The weirdest part is that Starfire has been shown to be able to comfortably survive in the vacuum of space several times. Then too there might be an explanation for both her (and Raven's) powers in that they're emotion based, which means that theoretically, a villain could defeat Starfire by getting her depressed enough. But the strangest would have to be in 'Haunted' where Robin (HUMAN!) manages to "hurt" her just by grabbing her arms?! Granted at that moment she is really shocked and confused at the way Robin was acting. But this is an alien that took a blast to her face in 'Troq' where she was also visibly upset at being discriminated by Val-Yor.
</li><li> Cyborg and Starfire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> also varies greatly just compared to each other, as one can be shown at any given moment to be an order of magnitude stronger than the other. For example, Cyborg was able to hold Starfire into submission with just <em>one arm</em> in the episode "Switched", but in another episode, Starfire was shown to be much stronger than Cyborg, also <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theteentitans/images/d/d6/Starlift.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120717130900">with the use of one arm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Robin has been shown to be able to curbstomp all of the other Titans 3 separate times, twice when they weren't holding back, and yet will also lose to villains that any one of the other members of the team can beat singlehandedly.
</li><li> Mammoth is an interesting case. Oftentimes he's able to top Cyborg or Starfire in Brute strength, but at least once Cyborg was able to overpower him in a shoving match.

However, if the same villains found themselves tangling with his weaker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Skeletor, they were shown to be unable to inflict so much as a wrinkle on his clothes.

Punching any of the bad guys with a similar level of force should've turned them into a pasty smear on the nearest wall, yet they were always treated as legitimate threats.

This is required since the monsters that randomly attack the town don't arrive in increasing levels of strength, so if they always just busted out the ultimate attacks they've shown in previous episodes, there wouldn't be much drama.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> has this bad. At times he can barely lift stuffed animals or a <em>straw</em> by himself, while at other times he can tear a mailbox out of the ground. There's also his skills with karate; at times he can equal Sandy and even beat her, while at other times he's incompetent to the point where Sandy literally kicks him around like a football.
<ul><li> Related to this is the fact he used to could shapeshift, which means he could sometimes be very strong, but in later seasons this trait has mostly vanished, getting SpongeBob stuck in situations where he could have easily escaped via shapeshifting.
</li><li> Also played with Patrick Star. While he is often extremely strong, to the point where he can throw his rock house around and lift the pavement off the ground, he has been seen as being so weak he can't rip paper apart.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> are notorious for this. One episode will have them proving themselves to adult heroes as the mightiest supers in their entire universe, and another will have all three girls get beaten down by a gang of ordinary thugs. Not to mention one time where an overweight nerd was able to trap them in toy packaging.
</li><li> Ladies &amp; gentlemen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a>. This trope is a perfect description of his "drama power." The in-story description of it is "nigh-invulnerability." The Tick is always the exact right amount of invulnerable to keep the plot going. So he's much more vulnerable during slapstick scenes.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em> is probably the greatest example of this trope. In spite of his muscular physique, he manages to find himself on the receiving end of a good beating by anyone barely half his size, <em>even by children</em>, which is pretty bizarre considering that he effortlessly wrestled a crocodile in an early episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Burns. He's always depicted as frail and weak, but just <em>how</em> frail and <em>how</em> weak depends on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">whatever makes the joke work</a>.
</li><li> Homer as well. On the one hand, he's often shown out of breath from the smallest amount of physical activity, and in "The Homer They Fall," one of his punches can't even kill a fly.

</li><li> Nelson is another example. Sometimes he's the toughest kid in school to the point where he's unfazed when Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph or (unsurprisingly) Bart try to beat him up. Other times he's able to be beaten up by the other bullies.

In his first appearance, Xavier was whupping Mesmero quite well until a mysterious voice (Apocalypse) said something about not knowing who he's dealing with, and suddenly Xavier is being plastered on the ground. In his next appearance Xavier defeats him easily. For most of his appearances he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, but in the <em>Dark Horizon</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a> he can suddenly take on Wolverine <em>and</em> Sabretooth at the same time.

</li><li> As noted above, Gladiator powers are based on his confidence and his appearances during Phoenix Saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> really shows it. At his first appearance he simply <em>ignores</em> Juggernaut punching him and then threw him to the ocean with one hand. Later, feeling conflicted about fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> against his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">personal code</a> allows her to knock him out with one punch. Also, how invulnerable is Rogue? Sometimes the same blast that sends Scott or Jean flying but doesn't put them out of the fight has a similar effect on her, sometimes having a <em>building</em> dropped on her is less than a mosquito bite. This during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> days with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel">Ms. Marvel</a>'s powers permanently absorbed.
</li><li> The mane cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is often subject to this. One example is Twilight Sparkle, whose telekinetic strength varies quite a bit (at one point, she lifts a two-story-house-sized bear and large water tower <em>simultaneously</em>, then later in the series, struggles to pull Fluttershy out of a box, even with the help of her friends). Fluttershy is almost a literal example, as she can match the speed of Rainbow Dash, the <em>fastest pony alive</em>, when she needs to, but in "Hurricane Fluttershy", can only get about one-fifth of Dash's wingpower, despite her training beforehand, and only pulls about half Dash's wingpower because she absolutely needed to. Big Macintosh is able to pull and entire <em>two story house</em> in one episode, but struggles to carry a large cake in another (although balancing is admittedly more difficult than pulling). Spike is repeatedly, <em>explicitly</em> shown to be stronger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">his size should allow</a>, but sometimes has difficulty in fetching large books.
<ul><li> In "Hurricane Fluttershy," it's proven to be mental: <em>stage fright</em> is why she has trouble flying and she repeatedly goes on about how all eyes would be on her. When practicing with her animal friends, they hold up masks that look like the background ponies, she'll <em>instantly</em> start tripping herself up until she gets better at it. When it's just her and her friends, she's able to fly normally.
</li></ul></li><li> This is common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, especially with Goliath. Sometimes he can rip the pusher off a bulldozer and hurl it through the air but at other times he has trouble taking on one very strong human. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Elisa</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoferTokenMinority">Maza</a> is an even greater example of the trope as despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> that usually relies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">brains over brute force,</a> she consistently ends up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">Designated Girl Fight</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Demona</a></em> over the latter's gun for as long as the plot needs her to, yet during an instance where Elisa <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">gargoyle,</a></span> it was treated like a long-overdue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a> right down to Demona's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">reaction.</a>
</li><li> As mentioned under the Superman examples above, this is present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> Particularly in regards to limiting four of the original seven, in order to keep them from solving every plot before Batman, Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl/Shayera have a chance to act.
<ul><li> Superman lives in a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardspeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardspeech">world of cardboard</a>" as he so named the trope for.
</li><li> Green Lantern John Stewart is notably lacking in creativity, and his constructs are overpowered regularly, despite believably being capable of destroying a planet on his own (later it's stated that a couple <em>dozen</em> Lanterns could easily destroy a planet with their blasts).
</li><li> The Martian Manhunter (J'onn J'onzz) rarely ever uses more than two powers per episode, though he's supposed to be one of the league's heavy hitters. He eventually relegated himself to behind the desk in <em>Unlimited</em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">putting himself out of action until the finale.</a>
</li><li> The Flash's speed and attention to detail were regularly limited to the point where he could be tripped by random thugs or the environment, and couldn't even see himself moving on tape. He eventually does access the upper limits of his power, before it's explained that using <em>that</em> much could kill him. It's stated that he doesn't use certain applications of his power (destructive resonance, phasing, vortex generation) because of how destructive they are.
</li><li> That, and they're <em>really</em> hard to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">and he doesn't have time for that.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Conversely, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Hawkgirl are inconsistently portrayed while being <em>more</em> powerful than they would regularly display:
<ul><li> Batman is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> who is generally portrayed as being smarter than everyone else, including the brilliant mind reader who first organized the team, and is active in situations that should readily get him killed.
</li><li> Wonder Woman, despite being portrayed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Naïve Newcomer</a> who didn't know what her items' abilities were until late in <em>Unlimited</em>, could go toe-to-toe with Superman and dropped her supplications for more power with "Hera, give me strength!"
</li><li> Hawkgirl/Shayera is stated to be a mental match for Batman and his strategic superior, but prefers to brute force her way through matters needlessly, and is generally reliant on her Nth-metal mace, which does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">whatever the plot says it does.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In talking to Supergirl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Steel">Steel</a> sums it up as being that the original seven have some special quality about them, even though they aren't all the most powerful, that helps them pull through.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: The skill and power of the Jedi tends to vary greatly from episode to episode. In some episodes, they'll be literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Armies</a> who effortlessly plow through dozens of battle droids and win entire battles single-handedly, in others, they'll struggle to beat a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> who may not even be all that badass. Exactly how strong the characters were in relation to each other was also very inconsistent, for example, in "Revenge", Obi-Wan teams up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ventress</span> to fight Savage Oppress and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Darth Maul,</span> and Obi-Wan says they're outmatched. In the very next episode, Obi-Wan fights the two again, <em>by himself</em>, and beats them handily, wounding Oppress and forcing the pair to flee. Standard Battle Droids also suffer badly from this. Whether they're a complete joke even with a massive numbers advantage or a legitimate threat in a fair fight varies with the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>. In "Dipper Vs Manliness", Dipper is skilled enough to go through the Manotaur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and beat the Multibear, a giant monstrous bear. However, in the later episode "Fight Fighters", he is shown to fear losing to Robbie, a normal teenager. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> as he is still a child and his body won't naturally produce enough muscle to last for long without keeping up the extreme training.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced">Spliced</a></em>: Two-Legs Joe suffers really badly from this. Most of the time, he's shown as having the strength to crush ordinary people easily, but not strong enough to stand a chance against other super-powered creatures like zombies or yetis. However, a few episodes turn him into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> able to create tornadoes and earthquakes, level entire cities, turn people inside out, create black holes, move celestial bodies, and alter the strength of gravity just by stomping his feet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em>, Wonder Woman and Aquaman's strength varied. Sometimes, they were depicted as only as strong as ordinary people and could be restrained by mooks or ropes. Sometimes, they were correctly depicted as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks">PJ Masks</a></em> is frequently guilty of this, most notably with Gekko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> (one moment he easily lifts heavy objects over his head, another moment a villain easily restrains him) and Catboy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> (sometimes he can perform feats that rival The Flash, other times he's certainly fast but still slow enough for a villain to intercept or dodge him).
</li><li> Fearless Fly, from 1965's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiltonTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiltonTheMonster">Milton the Monster</a>,</em> gets his superpowers from a pair of eyeglasses that magnifies his strength to match his eyesight. In an episode where he loses the glasses, he becomes as weak as his secret identity, Homer Housefly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> was guilty of this at the end of Book 1 with Mako resisting being bloodbent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Amon</a> enough to zap him with not only lightning, but enough a strong enough strike that sent Amon flying backwards into a wall. Bear in mind: 1. <em>Only</em> powerful waterbenders and/or Avatars using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">the Avatar State,</a> have done that, 2. Amon is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">strongest bloodbender in history</a> as his father was so strong he forced Aang in his prime to use the AS to even <em>move</em> and Tarrlok was capable of both suppressing Korra's firebending <em>and</em> knocking out nearly a dozen people at once, 3. Mako has <em>never</em> depicted being able to lightningbend without even a quick version of the usual wind-up motions of the technique nor suggested to be <em>that</em> powerful beforehand and 4. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Amon is literally watching/sensing Mako do it right in front of him.</a></em>
<ul><li> The show has also been accused of doing this with the Avatar State, which was weakened considerably to maintain drama due to how frequently Korra uses it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Rick Sanchez,</a> one of the two main protagonists from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, is very much this. Sometimes he can be seen slaughtering his way through whole armies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Federation Soldiers</a> without breaking a sweat, other times he can be shown to have met his match in single fights with other scientists or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">the President of the United States.</a> Due to the series' rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">unique</a> setting there are also multiple versions of Rick that make up an army of their own with presumably the same intellect and physical capabilities as him. However, they seem to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationofNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationofNinjutsu">slaughtered just as easily as other soldiers.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot">Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot</a></em>: Rusty, depending on whether or not the plot needs Big Guy to defeat the enemy. With Ep-327, he managed to defeat him after he took Big Guy down in a single shot, but against Big Guy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> built by the Legion, he only managed some cosmetic damage.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">     Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> According to Umberto Eco's seminal 1995 essay <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/">"Ur-Fascism"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the defining traits of all fascist movements is that they view what ever group they consider the enemy (which obviously varies depending on the fascist movement) as either an overwhelming threat that they have to stop immediately or as weak and ineffectual losers with no hope of winning, depending on what the propaganda requires at the time. He then goes on to suggest that this is part of why fascist governments invariably fail eventually: they are incapable of objectively gauging the strength of their enemies, and thus aren't able to fight them effectively
