</p><p>The world is filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide Eyed Idealists</a> who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">dark, cruel and brutal world</a> keeps letting them down. For them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it's the right thing to do.
</p><p>More often than not these characters are in settings that feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>. They're usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">survivors</a> who have largely given up on believing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, but still strive to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> or as close to it as reality allows them to be.

Such characters can also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a>; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don't do because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">that would be wrong</a>, and just because the world sucks doesn't mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> after much strife.
</p><p>This is the inverse of the worldview of most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a>, especially those who believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>. Extremists or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a> may <em>believe</em> themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow">Heroic Vow</a> related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really <em>matter</em> in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight's gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.

Members of the first type are former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide Eyed Idealists</a> who have come to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">accept</a> that their world is on the low end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>, but who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIdealist">still find something beautiful in their former ideals</a> that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">antiheroes</a>, but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.
</p><p>Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">Jade-Colored Glasses</a>; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.

<ul><li> Zora Ideale from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>. When he was young, he had a very idealistic view of the Magic Knights and aspired to be one himself, especially after his dad managed to rise through the ranks and become the first peasant to be a Magic Knight. However, his dad ended up being killed in battle and one day when he went to visit his grave, he overheard some Magic Knights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">calling him a loser of peasant</a>. This revelation of their corruption not only disillusioned Zora with the Magic Knights but also caused his outlook towards the world to become more dreary and realistic. In present day he himself is now a Magic Knight and with the Black Bulls no less but his hatred for the organization as a whole has not waivered and he's quite hesitant to bond with his teammates and the people he helps.
</li><li> Chilchuck from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, has this as the reasoning behind him being an adventurer who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>. He sees people who claim to work for free as the least deserving of trust as there is nothing in place to ensure it, and the way things are set up for adventurers jumping from one job to the next based solely on pay and not completion is the fastest way to end up with no jobs other than potentially criminal ones. Things just do not work out well for anyone but those who approach the matter as anything other than employment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Edward Elric is smug, rude, and claims to be motivated only by a desire to regain his and his brother's bodies, and yet he suffers from a really bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>.
</li><li> Roy Mustang considers himself to be an irredeemable monster for his actions during the Ishvalan War of Extermination and believes that his country is headed down a monstrous path. He knows he faces forces of unbelievable power and that his chances for success are nearly nil. Yet he works within the system to take it down, willingly suffering injuries to both his body and reputation, in order to make things right.
</li></ul></li><li> Fakir in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, fitting the jerk type, but only after he gets a grip on his - perfectly understandable - fear.
</li><li> Being a former assassin, the titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> has a very cynical view of the world. However, he'll seize any opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">fool around</a> and will help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide Eyed Idealists</a> whenever he can.
<ul><li> After being defeated by Kenshin, Sanosuke adopts this view as well. After his group the Sekihoutai were persecuted by the government, he's become a bit more cynical noting the arbitrary labels of good and evil, yet still resolves to protect the weak from oppression.

Hayate is seen to be <em>extremely</em> cynical due to his horrid childhood, especially in the manga, but simply can't help but help people he sees in need. Mostly. If he's particularly annoyed with someone (ex: The SC Rangers, Fumi) he will try to avoid getting involved with them but after getting roped into it anyway he always does his best to actually help out. Hinagiku is in a similar position, as past experience has also left her quite cynical to the point where she's more likely to snark at a villain's motives than actually be surprised. Nevertheless, she is a steadfast Ally of Justice (with a legendary sword or two to prove it) who will leap into action to protect others. Both also have a shared trait of helping others even when it would be a detriment to themselves.

He then goes on to questions his own codes of honour when he discovers that his pupil, the young King Einon did not have his nature poisoned by Draco's tampering with his heart but merely exploited Bowen for his skills in swordsmanship and became evil of his own volition.

<div class="indent"> <strong>McClane:</strong> You know what you get for being a hero? Nothin'. You get shot at. You get a little pat on the back, blah, blah, blah, attaboy. You get divorced.

An adaptation of a John Le Carre book (of which the character is known for utilizing this trope in his realist spy novels), Bachmann is the typical Le Carre protagonist where he is jaded and cynical about his world and the corruption around him but seeks to do the best job he can anyway because of some personal morality.

<ul><li> Jake started off wanting to fight to free Tom and save the world. As the series progressed, he became more hardened and cynical, realizing that there was no help coming, and it was just as likely that he end up killing Tom as saving him. Despite that, he continued the fight and made the hard decisions, because he had to do something, and fighting the Yeerks was the right thing to do.
</li><li> Despite all the battles he won, and all the blows he struck against the Yeerk Empire, Elfangor wasn't even sure he was making a difference.

Still, he believes wholeheartedly in his father's beliefs about goodness and decency, is honorable and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">heroic</a>, and strives to do the right thing but — though he doesn't feel good about going against rules — will compromise them when necessary, in order to do what's right and protect innocent lives.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen as well.
</li><li> Ned Stark is very honorable, believes in duty, but thinks the world sucks and most people don't care for anything. However, <em>he</em> keeps trying, holds onto his goodness, largely adheres to a strict code of honour and does what's right, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which gets him killed</span>, but these latter two things aren't always the same thing. As a result, though he is uncomfortable doing so, he is willing to sacrifice his honor in some instances for the sake of doing the right thing.
</li><li> Adding the Hound to this page would involve unwisely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">calling him a knight</a>. However, his armour is made of the purest citric acid. Even he would cop to that.
</li><li> There's also Tyrion Lannister, who's snarktastic and has contempt or hatred for most of those around him (because they either assume he's a Lannister and think he's untrustworthy, or see that he's dwarf and dislike him based on <em>that</em>), but he truly tried to do what was best for the kingdom. He also showed his concern by designing a special saddle for Bran after his fall and went back to Winterfell to give them his design, although he knew he would not be much welcome there.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister surprises himself far more than anybody else by gradually regaining principles to (sarcastically) defend and genuinely believe in after years of resigning himself to being nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a> in a clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, since believing in inherent goodness and nobility failed him the first time. The process is spotty, but, dammit, he's going to give doing the right thing a shot... and, sod the consequences!
</li><li> Davos Seaworth has seen (and done) a lot of illegal and corrupt shit in his life, but still maintains a belief in the rightness of fairly-applied, impartial justice and the rule of law. Which is why he's Stannis Baratheon's Jiminy Cricket. However wonky and venal the world they're trying to improve.
</li></ul></li><li> Sturm Brightblade of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> has watched the Knights of Solamnia he grew up idolizing turn into earnest failures at best and corrupt monsters at worst.

<ul><li> Sam Vimes. He's described as possibly being slightly knurd in his natural state — anti-drunk, which means seeing things horribly clearly without all the normal fuzzy self-deception that makes life bearable — and yet, he's one of the most incorruptible, moral, and downright decent characters on the Disc, hands down. (Vimes is also <em>literally</em> a sour knight, having been elevated into the ranks of nobility against his wishes — he feels it makes him a class traitor.)
</li><li> Granny Weatherwax. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad">Witches Abroad</a></em> alludes the idea Granny was a good candidate for a "bad witch," until her sister took up the role and she had to balance it out. Granny's adamant belief in Right and Wrong over anything else is predicated on the fact that neither of those necessarily involve what someone (including herself) would <em>like</em> to do.

</li><li> Karrin Murphy is being forced toward a change in worldview by the realization of the cold fact that the law, which she idolized (almost literally) in early books is just simply inadequate to deal with the reality of the world as she has come to know it. She's also begun to realize just how much Harry was <em>protecting</em> her, even when she angrily insisted she wanted no such protection; now she knows she needed it...and resents that fact.
</li><li> In <em>Blood Rites</em>, when Harry looks upon Murphy with his Sight, she appears as an angel, but one that has been covered in blood and soot and is bearing terrible wounds - a direct contrast to the more idealistic image of a pure angel in shining white clothes that she appears as in <em>Grave Peril</em>, four books earlier when she is still an idealistic cop who hasn't had her faith in the law twisted and abused.

</div></li></ul></li><li> Councillor Arfarra in Yulia Latynina's <em>Wei Empire Cycle</em> started out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>. By the first large novel, he became sourly disillusioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and somewhat penitent, but soldiered on trying to reform it, ultimately failing despite doing some good in the process. Then he became <em>even more</em> disillusioned in the very foundations of the Empire, and spent twenty-five years in exile. <em>Then</em> he got dragged back unto the political scene, and very reluctantly took control, this time just trying to keep the whole thing running and to avoid having the world drowned in blood in a horrible civil war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He sort of failed due to circumstances far beyond his control, but kept relentlessly looking for ways to at least marginally improve the situation right until finally dying from old age.</span>
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Severus Snape allies himself with people like Harry (who he hates because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the son of the woman he loved by the man he hated</span>), Sirius Black (who he hated nearly as much as James Potter and who tried to kill him at least once), and Dumbledore, whom, in spite of affection, he allows to use him ruthlessly. He's also the only one of the heroes who is willing to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">branded as a traitor</a> by making a huge sacrifice for their cause (namely, Albus Dumbledore). Additionally, his motives, in the beginning, weren't the purest - as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lily was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostLenore">Lost Lenore</a></span>, he made it fairly clear that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution">Not in This for Your Revolution</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretty much entirely motivated by Lily's memory at first. Later his actions that would have been hard to envision by any reader in previous books - risking cover to save Lupins life, defending Harry from Dumbledores plan and yet continuing with it despite the fact it would, as far as he knows, completely defeat his previously claimed motivation it is all for Lilys memory, as her son would be sacrificed after all in favour of defeating Voldemort, and his curious remarks on his soul and Only those whom I could not save - show that as much as we found out about Snape in the Princes Tale and despite the general impression from this we are as familiar with his character as with Dumbledores or Harrys, the chapter raises more questions about his true thoughts than it answers them - we still dont really <em>know</em> the man, as in, what really motivated him in all those moments and how Dumbledore could be confident of his dedication to the plan despite all these challenges even after Dumbledore himself is no longer there, but it suggests an element of genuine care for the cause of good side beyond his initial personal motives, especially since there is really nothing in it for him. The contrast between the scene at the hilltop and the scene in Dumbledores office sixteen years later, as well as his later actions, suggest an only-glimpsed-at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> throughout the years from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution">Not in This for Your Revolution</a> to a more good state of mind, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> comments on the manner he chose to remain silent and allow himself to die in order to ensure Harrys victory show he genuinely wants Voldemort stopped not for revenge itself, but atonement that initially began only with Lilys death</span>.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs">Altered Carbon</a></em>, Takeshi Kovacs seems to be an inversion of this; a life-long cynic, Kovacs has slowly but steadily gained an idealistic side, strongly influenced by the philosophy of his homeworld's revered revolutionary leader and Knight in Sour Armour Quellcrist Falconer. However, his particular status has left the cynicism <em>deeply</em> ingrained, with the result that he seems to strongly resent his idealistic side and reacts with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkKnight">Snark Knight</a> schtick that ranges from convincing to desperate.
</li><li> Typically in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>, Luke Skywalker is quite idealistic. But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor">Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> makes him mentally experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">an eternity after the heat death of the universe</a> in an attempt to break him and get him ready for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>. It doesn't entirely work, but when Luke gets out, he's made deeply cynical, believing that <em>everyone's</em> life is waste, saving someone wasn't really saving them because that would just prolong the brief interval. All striving leads to nothing, and everyone who talked about duty and honor and love was just using him. He doesn't want to believe it, but he does—and he makes the very conscious decision to act exactly as he did before, like when he trusted in these airy concepts and believed lives were worth saving, in the hope that he can fall back into the dream and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">become the mask</a>. Later he sees a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>-y vision that relieves some of that cynicism, though, so he's not a sour knight for very long.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters">The Screwtape Letters</a></em>, Screwtape, a demon's mentor, warns him about these. "Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but intending, to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">our Enemy's</a> will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys." Ironically, he occasionally takes the tone of one himself, finding that his goal to corrupt humans is tedious whenever it fails but believing that it "must win in the end".

</li><li> Dedicate Rosethorn from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> series qualifies.

If you ask him what he thinks about the knight's oath to 'protect the weak' he'll tell you it's a 'suicide oath'. However, he still possesses faith in God and the idealism that he can make the world a better place.
</li><li> Corwin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber">The Chronicles of Amber</a></em> is, in many ways, an homage to Phillip Marlowe, so it's little surprise that he shares this trope.

Often he puts others' safety before himself. He ultimately decides to tip off police about Shayla's abusive boyfriend, who's a drug and weapons dealer, even if it means not being able to get his withdraw medication, though he was hesitant at first. He also dislikes any innocent people getting hurt, even if the end result is something he wants.

</li></ul></li><li> Robb Stark becomes one, especially as the war goes on.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister is much closer to this as of Season 4. For a long time, he was scornful of the double standards of chivalry as far as how Westeros regards his "kingslaying" and how in their eyes, he's dishonored himself for all time. Despite this, Jaime does value the Kingsguard and does aspire to the example of the likes of Ser Barristan. He tells his father, Tywin, that while he has soured his honor for killing a king, he won't sour it by abandoning the Kingsguard altogether.

He does have moments of idealism, though, as shown when he protects a group of warrior kids from the Cylons while stranded on a planet in which nearly everyone else is wiped out.
</li><li> Apollo can be this at times as well, especially towards the Council. Given that they were responsible for their long-time enemies blowing up all twelve of their homeworlds, it's not all that jarring.

</li><li> After spending two regenerations as a young-looking and acting man, the Twelfth Doctor was once again a cranky old man.

Min Ja is a former detective who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> refused to leave her post while her four-year-old son was dying in the hospital</span>, only to be ordered to destroy the evidence and close the case. Young Jae was one of five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> who opposed the regime's media censorship by way of a pirate radio broadcast and went to prison for eleven years, only to find two of his former friends dead at, seemingly, the hand of the third. At one point in the series, they have a conversation in which they both admit that they are this trope—and that they both hope that the hero, still in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> phase of his life, will succeed without becoming like them.

She's cynical to the core, often rude, sarcastic, pushes others away, and generally doesn't show much <em>outward</em> sympathy to others. She still does everything in her power to protect innocent lives, including (if there's no other way) giving Kilgrave, the one who traumatized her in the first place, what he asks for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>
<ul><li> The show ran afoul of this in its earliest seasons with a cast that could almost be described as a cluster of rain clouds who live and breathe sarcasm and misanthropy. (Probably justified in a show focused on "especially heinous" assault and abuse cases.) Even the guest cast of suspects and crossover cast had nothing to add but more rain. Some episodes seemed to be a reminder how <em>everyone</em> hated life. In later seasons, the show started to get out of its funk.
</li><li> The biggest example is former ADA Alex Cabot. Once, she was all about the law, incredibly strict to the point of undermining a case rather than cross ethical lines. After a long absence, Cabot returns in season 19's "Sunk Cost Fallacy" where she is now part of a group who help battered women and children escape their lives by faking their deaths. She's even willing to let a husband go to jail for the "murder" of his family. A fight with Liv has Cabot ranting on how Liv could have lied under oath as the "tell the whole truth" thing is just a load of crap to make people think the justice system gives a damn about them and her methods work much better.
<div class="indent"><strong>Liv:</strong> What happened to you? <br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I opened my eyes. I opened them wide, and I saw that for twelve years I was a cog in a "holier than thou" wheel and the wheel keeps spinning and tossing off bodies as it goes.

Eventually, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> decides he's not the man for the job, goes back 300 years, kills earlier self, and intentionally loses his fight with Cap.

</li><li> Methos from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> (at least in his more recent days). Even though he keeps claiming to only serve his own purposes and to do things just to save his own skin, in reality he frequently goes out of his way - often quite literally, and sometimes even to the point of risking his own life - to help and protect others. And as we see in his history as a medical doctor, that's probably not limited to his life after meeting Duncan MacLeod, despite his claims to the contrary...

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse worldview</a> basically consisted of a largely amoral universe where bad things happened to good people and everything ended in death. Yggdrasil was eaten by serpents from below, and deer from above, and even the Aesir would die at Ragnarok. Until then, the Aesir weren't entirely good guys either. Nevertheless, the warrior's code was to fight the good fight and the mythology is riddled with examples of standing and fighting even when death is inevitable because that's the right thing to do. On the other hand, Thor was viewed as the protector of Midgard and friend of Men, the Good Guy fighting giants to protect the Aesir and humans alike. Most stories focusing on him tend to be far more upbeat, with Thor overcoming challenges after much fun is made at his expense.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">The Four Gospels</a> portray Him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> could say "forgive the one who hurts you, and do good to those that persecute you" when He knew in advance that He was to die—brutally—to save all mankind from themselves.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A common character type in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, especially among the Imperium of Man. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt</a> is perhaps the most prominent example, a genuinely selfless, courageous, and noble hero who is becoming deeply bitter and cynical towards the Imperial Guard command structure. Major Elim Rawne of the same series quite arguably worked his way into this trope from the other direction-he started as a ruthlessly cynical, self-serving bastard, and remains a ruthlessly cynical bastard-but one with a very tarnished and deeply hidden heart of gold. Commissar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, <strong>HERO OF THE IMPERIUM</strong>, projects this at times... because his reputation (and possibly he) would be shot if anyone knew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">how he actually is</a>.
<ul><li> The author himself has stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">that he doesn't know</a> if Cain really is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> he presents himself as, or if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Cain just doesn't give himself enough credit</a>. Still, Cain isn't like the stereotypical commissar that shoots his own men at the drop of a hat, which is a huge point in his favor.
</li><li> Certain members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Tau</a> have lived long enough and seen enough of the universe to understand that their race is fundamentally naive and that their dream of uniting the galaxy under the Greater Good is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a> at best. However, they reconcile themselves with the Greater Good by embracing the philosophy that even if the Greater Good is a utopian ideal and their galaxy a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, simply striving towards those ideals is good enough.
</li><li> And then there's the Lamenters Chapters. Founded during the Cursed 21st Founding, they are Blood Angels successor chapter who seems to be free of the Red Thirst and Black Rage. Unfortunately, they seem to be cursed by terrible, <em>terrible</em> luck, going into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobie</a> status. And yet despite being distrusted by their own allies, almost annihilated for unwittingly fighting for the wrong side, almost eaten by Tyranids, and forbidden from recruiting more to their Chapter, they are <em>still</em> loyal to the Imperium. Hell, other chapters have been known to turn renegade for a fraction of the shit they went through.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> brings you the Grey Guard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a></em>. Paladins who tend to fall early and often for breaking their code in the pursuit of genuine Good (not making the job quick and easy) are sometimes approached by the knightly equivalent of the CIA. The abilities they pick up take the 'goodness and light' of the Paladin and turn it into 'goodness and Bad Cop interrogations.'
<ul><li> The Paladin class itself flirts with being an example of this even <em>before</em> one takes the Gray Guards into account, especially in a setting where the government is harsh or totalitarian. It's pointed out in the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> that when faced with a choice between Law and Good, a true Paladin will always choose the latter (the Paladin's code in the book has a loophole about "Legitimate" authority for this reason).
</li><li> A fairly common character archetype in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>. The continent has just emerged from a devastating hundred-year war that culminated in the annihilation of an entire country in a disaster nobody knows about or predicts. The dragonmarked houses use their innate powers for profit. The afterlife is a shithole where souls linger in boredom for a while, losing their nature, and then dissolve. Every religion has its share of corruption. As a result, a lot of heroes are cynical, but still fight to make it a better place, one dead tentacle monster at a time. This is particularly common in Karrnath: the country is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">cold and northern, with short summers and long winters</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist">Naytheistic</a> Blood of Vol religion is ingrained in the local culture (with a bit of a struggle going on between the true believers and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Path of Inspiration</a> elements hijacked by Erandis d'Vol), the Last War didn't go so hot for them (better than Cyre, at least), and the region was known for a grim and fatalistic temperament even before that.
</li></ul></li><li> As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a> setting is bound to eat your average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> for breakfast, it's home to quite a few of these instead, striving to hold back the darkness. The game-setting's knights of the Circle function more like vigilantes or undercover operatives, keeping their heroic deeds under the darklords' radar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> being what it is, most established characters with a strong moral compass fall under this category. A near-embodiment of this trope, however, is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.shadowrun4.com/resources/timeline.shtml">Captain Chaos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

She has suffered enough Compromises to give up on her belief that moral and upright behavior can function in the world as it now is, but she clings doggedly to what principles she has left and to the hope that someday the world can be made a better place, a place where idealism is once again workable and where the compromises she has been driven to will no longer be needed.

When he converts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dulcinea</span> to his cause, she becomes a full-fledged example.

</li><li> Miguel de Cervantes, or at least his character here, is more this than Don Quixote (although the two are described as being closely related) because Quixote seems to be more truly mad. Cervantes specifically gives a speech saying that he has seen evil in the world, but that it has convinced him even more that it is important to do good. People "asking not why they died, but why they had ever lived" for example.

His family troubles and basically living in endless poverty has a "live-and-let-live" sort of view on justice.

</li><li> Alistair from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> fits this trope well. He LITERALLY stopped short of becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>.
<ul><li> You yourself can play as one of these too, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential">if you so choose.</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">If.</a></em>
</li><li> Also a natural fit for an elf Grey Warden—humans have been bastards to you, your family, and your race for longer than they can remember, and don't exactly feel guilty about it. The game demands that you save the mostly human kingdom of Ferelden, reunite it under legitimate political authorities, and generally leave it a much stronger and more powerful nation than it was before you entered the picture. One bit of dialogue has an NPC thanking you for saving the kingdom, and one of your responses is along the lines of "I'm saving <em>my</em> people from the Blight. <em>Your</em> kingdom can burn for all I care."
</li><li> His fellow tank warrior Aveline from the sequel also fits; she's a world-weary widowed soldier and cop who's seen a lot of bloodshed and suffering and whose goal is to protect her friends and keep what order she can in the world.
</li><li> Varric Tethras fits into this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. In the beginning, he outright states that he's pretty sure the world is going to end no matter what they do, but he stays and helps anyways. By the end, should you play your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">cards</a> right, he changes his attitude a little by believing that the Inquisition, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Inquisitor</a> leading them, is the final, best hope for Thedas, but he still acknowledges that the world is in a bad situation.
</li><li> Hawke can fall into this, especially Snarky Hawke: they've lost friends, family, siblings, they've had a ton of crap dropped on them, and while they'll drop sarcastic asides at every opportunity, they'll still force themselves up and go and do the right thing.
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> qualify for this. Rose of Sharon Cassidy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">hard-drinking and somewhat surly woman</a> who also happens to have a strong moral code, being the one character who will specifically complain about the player's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> if it gets incredibly low. Also, there's Colonel Hsu and Chief Hanlon of the NCR, who despite being personally against the war (especially considering the fact that their commander, General Oliver is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a>) do what they can for the sake of the soldiers
<ul><li> Orion Moreno and "Cannibal" Johnson are also good examples, especially Orion. Both were former members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">the Enclave</a>. At the destruction of their oil rig, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">New California Republic</a> dismantled the Enclave, seeing them as too great a potential threat to ignore. Decades later, the NCR finds itself up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Caesar's Legion</a>, a group of totalitarian slavers. Moreno sympathizes with the Legion, unable to forgive the NCR for defeating the Enclave, which he considered the last remnant of the old America (and he's kind of right). Johnson supports the NCR, seeing their democratic government to be in the spirit of the old America and preferring them to the brutality of the Legion. Both men can be convinced to join the final battle—but serving the wrong side will require a very difficult Speech check—Johnson will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> abandon you rather than fight the NCR</span>, and Moreno will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> try to kill you—after donning his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and hefting a minigun</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Squall Leonhart from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> veers between this and just being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> (later revealed to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love Redeems</a>.) Especially notable because doing the right thing, for him, means not only fighting for a world he might not think is worth fighting for (most of the game, anyway), but also serving the forces which have forbidden him from exercising his free will for his entire life. (Though, to be fair, he has been strung along most of the time because he doesn't know what he would do otherwise)
</li><li> Lightning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> is a female example. She does believe in doing what's right, but the world she lives in is so messed-up she has very little "right" to believe in and she bitterly laments her fate as a cursed l'Cie.
<ul><li> While we're on the subject of <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>, how about Sazh and Oerba Yun Fang? Sazh's only desire is to see his son again and he's willing to turn himself in to see his son one last time before he is executed. Vanille is what keeps him going. The same is said for Fang when it is revealed that she was a Pulse l'Cie before the start of the game along with Vanille <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and cracked Coocoon's shell as Ragnarok.</span> By extension, the entire main cast if you go by their backstories and their cursed fate as a l'Cie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> Oerba Dia Vanille who lied to everyone about being a Pulse l'Cie so she could help them. Had she not lied at all, things would have gone differently.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Cody from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em>, and later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> series is a perfect example. In <em>Final Fight</em>, he was a straight out Hero, who fought the Mad Gear Gang to rid his city of them and rescue his girlfriend Jessica. Along the way, he beats up a corrupt cop named Edi, who later has him arrested for assault and battery. While in prison he develops an addiction to fighting, and when he gets out, walks the streets looking for the slightest provocation to fight. After he is thrown back into prison, his girlfriend leaves him and travels to Europe, her father Haggar is all but through helping Cody, and only his best friend Guy still believes in him. By the time of the <em>Street Fighter</em> series, he believes that he is no longer a hero and that the only purpose he has left in the world is to fight, which he frequently tells everybody is meaningless. However, he still has <em>some</em> desire to protect the world, as he breaks out of prison to seek out villains like Bison and Seth to defeat, and his theme implies he wishes to relive his glory days of heroism, but has convinced himself it is too late.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, the Avatar becomes this in the <em>Conquest</em> route, and develops some shades of this in the <em>Revelations</em> route. In the <em>Conquest</em> route, their wide-eyed naivete is slowly crushed by the bitter experiences throughout the route (though does nothing to shatter their resolve to see their mission through). In the case of <em>Revelations</em>, they mostly have elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>, but because of learning the truth behind the conflict, and the fact that there is a bigger threat in the form of Anankos, they become no longer naive about the happenings of the world anymore and their naivete is tempered by wisdom.
</li><li> Ryudo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII">Grandia II</a></em> fits this trope to a tee, in reaction to the original title's protagonist, Justin, who was an idealist with a strong wanderlust — almost Sonic the Hedgehog in human form. In the sequel, Ryudo is a misanthropic mercenary who wants nothing more than to escort his charge (a sickeningly cheery do-gooder, Elena) from A to B and collect his reward. He's also a bit of a smartass, always ready with a sarcastic remark. The game goes down the usual JRPG paths, peeling back the onion to expose Ryudo's reasons for distrusting everyone and everything, and revealing his kinder side from time to time.
</li><li> Manuel Calavera of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango">Grim Fandango</a></em> is a cynical man who claims to only look out for himself. When he joins the LSA and heads out across the Land of the Dead to search for Mercedes, he claims it's only because she is his ticket to the next world. However, he does thaw somewhat over the course of the story, as particularly evidenced by his relationships with Meche, Glottis, and the Angelitos. As Grim Fandango was based on several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> classics including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleIndemnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleIndemnity">Double Indemnity</a></em>, this characterization fits the milieu perfectly.
</li><li> Canach from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>. He made some bad choices in the past, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">he's trying to make up for that</a> by helping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Commander</a> fight the elder dragons and save the world. That said, he is still holding onto his salty attitude, making him fit solidly into this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GwentTheWitcherCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GwentTheWitcherCardGame">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a></em>: The Northern Realms pack a lot of knightly units with big swords and shiny armor, but their vocal callouts pack a lot of bitterness and sarcasm.

</div></li><li> Cole MacGrath from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous">inFAMOUS</a></em>. If you finish the game with good karma, he ends up as Empire City's savior, but the final scene has him musing about his isolation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(given that his girlfriend is dead and his best friend's betrayed him)</span> and wondering how long it will be before the city turns against him. Unfortunately for him, he <em>knows</em> that there's something big and powerful coming, and he's the only one that can stop it. He's <em>not</em> happy about it at all.
</li><li> Pit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> is a cheerful and optimistic angel who does his best to protect humanity and serve his Goddess. He's also well-aware of the flaws of every side of the War by the end of the game, noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Humans Are Flawed</a> and that the Gods are certainly destructive and selfish in their own right, but chooses to believe that humans are worth protecting and that his Goddess is worth serving, all the same.
</li><li> Jolee Bindo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> has rejected the Jedi Order as hypocritical and hidebound, but he hasn't rejected his moral center. Carth Onasi fits the trope as well. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">closer to good</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> than the <em>Jedi</em> in your party, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">capability to trust in the good of others</a> has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">torpedoed</a> by personal tragedy. He's vocally suspicious regarding the player character and the entire situation; that suspicion eventually turns out to be eerily dead-on. The comics, set a few years before the events of the game, make it clear that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his entanglement with Revan</span> wasn't the first time he found himself involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Jedi scheme and cover-up</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em>, Herschel Biggs and Jack Kelso are both perfectly aware of and disappointed in the state of the Los Angeles, and how little of what they do is actually meaningful. They try their damnedest anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Protagonist Cole makes the shift from idealist to sour knight over the course of the game, despite his attempts not to, thanks to the corruption and politics endemic in the LAPD.</span>
</li><li> Agate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em> is a perpetually angry young man who especially at first has nothing but scorn for the heroine and her extremely optimistic outlook. In spite of the misanthropy, he's one of the best Bracers in Liberl. Originally, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">Used to Be a Sweet Kid</a> until his little sister died during the war, making him channel all his anger into fighting, not helped when he joins a gang in Ruan until he got the crap beaten out of him by local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeParagon">Greater-Scope Paragon</a> Cassius. He softens up a bit after befriending the preteen Tita, who he became fond of after she went out of her way to protect him. He eventually becomes even less sour when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Loewe</a> of all people deconstructs that mindset as regressive. If he just uses his sword as a crutch to channel his anger, he'll never be able to move past his weakness and find enlightenment. Yet he's too sentimental to fully make use of his vengeance as a tool, not a crutch and commit to villainy. That, and an effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">speech</a> from Tita to trust her as a friend, and not his sister's replacement.
</li><li> Hash from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive">Live A Live</a></em>. After defeating the demon king, he was heralded as a hero, but the very nature of human beings continued to disgust him much to the extent that he faked his death and hid out in a cabin in the mountains, only being convinced to help Oersted save humanity again because, despite his hatred, he knows that it's the right thing to do. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When he dies, he asks Oersted to believe in his friends and not become bitter as he did.

He starts a vigilante group on Omega to help combat the crime, corruption, and decay of the station, and admits that he knows he wasn't really making a big difference; for all of the irritation he gave the mercenary groups after him, Omega was a pisshole when he started and was a pisshole when he left. And he fights on anyway.

</div></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Shadow the Hedgehog eventually becomes one. He went from fighting against the world to fighting for himself, to fighting <em>for</em> the world. Pretty much his only reason for this is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">a little girl told him to before she died</a>. It took Shadow a while to remember that, but when he did, the bad guys began wishing he was still one of them. When one of the villains tries to bring Shadow over to his side by telling him that the world will turn on him one day, Shadow simply responds by saying he'll fight like he used to.
</li><li> Gerald Robotnik. Since he's an old guy, he can't really fight, but he knew that humanity was good and deserved saving. So what did he do? He created an immortal, powerful hedgehog named Shadow to protect humans, despite that Shadow pretty much <strong>hates</strong> humans, calling them "pathetic" at every chance he gets. Bonus for Gerald in that he pretty much hates humans just as much as Shadow, although this may be because the aforementioned little girl was his granddaughter, and her death made him go insane, considering how she'd been killed because experiments to save her had been considered too dangerous. However, when he <em>was</em> sane, he reveals to Shadow that he built the gigantic gun on the ARK station to actually save the Earth from an alien attack that would happen <em>50 years later</em>, while Shadow previously thought that he had built it to destroy Earth. Guess who pulls the trigger?

However he does eventually free himself from it and becomes a remorseful, driven man who believes his life is worth nothing if he can't put an end to Soul Edge as penance for his sins.

</li><li> Jim Raynor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> (and Kerrigan lampshaded it) before he realized that the Koprulu Sector was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>. As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a>,</em> he's still a Knight In Sour Armor. By the "Heart of the Swarm" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kerrigan herself</span> joins him there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Keeper</a> (later known as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Minister of Intelligence</span>) in the Imperial Agent storyline. He joined Imperial Intelligence hoping to do some good for the Empire, only to be blocked by red tape and Sith interference at every turn, and usually forced to just make things worse for people. Years of this have led to him becoming a massive cynic. Still, he keeps on trying to use his power to do the right thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, he finally gets the chance to do some good, helping the Agent destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Star Cabal</a> and giving the Agent the option to use the Black Codex to wipe out all evidence of their existence, abandoning Imperial government in favour of acting as a sort of freelancer, helping the Empire wherever help is needed.</span>
<ul><li> It's also very easy for the Imperial Agent themselves to become this, as a result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> they can have to endure. Many players find their Agent becoming increasingly less idealistic and more disillusioned with the Empire, similar to what Keeper went through.

He started out as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an idealist alongside Mithos Yggdrasill who just wanted half-elves to be accepted</span>, and then became what we see in the game.
<div class="indent"><strong>Colette:</strong> Our weapons are love! <br/><strong>Genis:</strong> Justice! And... <br/><strong>Kratos:</strong> Sigh...hope.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Yuri Lowell</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> left the royal knights because he felt they were doing very little to change the lives of the poor and downtrodden and end the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">corruption among the upper class</a>, but his sense of honor and justice still drives him toward this goal.
</li></ul><ul><li> Garrett from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Thief">Thief</a></em> fits this role well. He's a completely unrepentant criminal who acts as though he has nothing but contempt for others, his surroundings, and the whole corrupt, depraved pit that is the City and the world he lives in - <em>most</em> of the time. But there are hints that Garrett cares more than he'd ever want to or admit when he witnesses cruelty against almost anybody, especially the poor and already down-trodden, and even people who've tried in the past to kill him. (Possibly because it's a really, really long list.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Aiden Pearce</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em> could be seen as a deconstruction as, while he deals with his grief over letting his niece die by trying to clean up Chicago, the level of drivenness one has to have to chase after something like this has many consequences that you need to turn a blind eye to if you want to keep going. Innocent people often get hurt during his deeds, he has become violently unempathetic, and the idea that his family will be whole again once he completes his mission only ends up putting them in harm's way and causing a deep rift when he ignores his sister's pleas to stop causing them problems.
</li><li> This is probably the defining characteristic of Geralt of Rivia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>. As a mutant monster hunter, Geralt is hated by almost everyone and knows it since they mock him, spit on him and violently attack him just for being what he is. As a witcher, he is solely supposed to work for money killing monsters. That said, he <em>is</em> an actual knight, just one that barely uses the title if at all. Despite always telling himself and others that he only works for money and doesn't want to get involved with normal people or politics, Geralt seems to have one of the worst cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> of any character anywhere, constantly putting his life on the line for people who don't care if he lives or dies. This exchange from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">the third game</a> solidifies it:

Hes rude, incredibly sardonic, and is initially only driven by his own desire to survive no matter what, but hell do the right thing more often than not and even saves Shibuya thanks to his growing idealism and willingness to change for the better.

The best example of this kind of character would have to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the aged alternate version if Riff in the 4-U City arc, who has been tirelessly working to fix his doomed world for decades while knowing that the dystopia he's ignoring is causing the citizens to suffer.

Seeing that possible future causes Riff to reaffirm his idealism during that arc, but even he ends up landing in a balance between idealist and cynic most of the time.

He agrees to help the Mukhtar, a member of a genie hunting, magic sensing race that is considered the mortal enemy of all genies. The reason? If he does so, the Mukhtar will free his friends Aladdin and co., who have been captured and trapped in a magical locket. At one point the Mukhtar is attacked by a plant creature, and Genie seizes the opportunity to snatch the locket and run away. However, because he is a good guy, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConscienceMakesYouGoBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConscienceMakesYouGoBack">conscience</a> forces him to turn around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">save the Mukhtar</a> from the plant creature. Later he is betrayed by the Mukhtar and sold out to Mozenrath, a sorcerer who hired the Mukhtar to catch Genie. After being imprisoned in a crystal, he angrily says to himself "I could have run away, but noooooo, I'm a GOOD guy!" Later the Mukhtar turns around and saves the protagonists, including Genie, from Mozenrath, but the point still stands. Sometimes a good character will be disgusted with itself for doing the right thing when amorality could have paid off so much more.

He particularly tried to help the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets">Irish</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">even the Catholic ones</a> - having himself seen (as an Anglo-Irishman born in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dublin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dublin">Dublin</a>) exactly how wretchedly they lived. Sometimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal">he did both at once</a>. Worth spelling out that Swift was the Dean of Dublin Cathedral, thus a high official in the Anglican Church of Ireland, which at the time believed that <em>all Catholics would go to hell.</em> (And it gets better - the Deanship was really a political appointment, so he was not just going against the policy of the Church, but of the State as well.)
</li></ul><ul><li> The official philosopher of this view must be Joseph de Maistre, who wrote in his <em>St. Petersburg Dialogues</em>:
<div class="indent">The philosopher can even discover how permanent carnage is provided for and ordained in the grand scheme of things. But will this law stop at man? Undoubtedly not. Yet who will kill him who kills everything else? Man! It is man himself who is charged with slaughtering man.
</div><div class="indent">But how can he accomplish this law, he who is a moral and merciful being, who is born to love, who weeps for others as for himself, who finds pleasure in weeping and who even invents fiction to make himself weep, and finally, to whom it has been said that <em>whoever sheds blood unjustly, by man shall his blood be shed</em>?

Søren Kierkegaard, considered the first Existentialist philosopher, basically described his Knight of Faith as a somewhat more poetic version of this trope. Like both nihilists ("aesthetic people") and those who resign themselves to the afterlife (the "knight of infinite resignation"), he knows that pursuing an unreachable goal in this world is cynically absurd/meaningless (if it's impossible to reach someone you love, the vast majority would just give up), yet in contrast to them he does anyway as a way of making his life even more meaningful.

</li></ul><ul><li> War poets such as Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen subverted this trope slightly in the sense that they wrote about hating war whilst continuing to serve as soldiers (since they would still have viewed fleeing as treacherous and cowardly). Rudyard Kipling played it a little straighter in the sense that he likewise took on a less jingoistic tone in his poetry after his son died in battle, but he continued to view the concept of besmirching soldiers or the war effort as little better than treason.
