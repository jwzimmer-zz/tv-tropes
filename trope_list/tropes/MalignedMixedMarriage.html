</p><p>And of course, sometimes it's a mixed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">species</a></em> marriage, or one between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleMageRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleMageRomance">muggle and a mage</a>, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">attendant prejudice</a>.

</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, mixed-race marriages can be everything from completely accepted to something you only do if you've got a death wish. Thankfully, in many places it's skewed towards the "completely accepted" end of the spectrum, and a great way for someone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">reveal themselves as a severe jackass</a> is to show bigotry towards mixed couples. Mixed-race marriages seem to be one of the last bastions of racism. Many opponents of interracial marriage claim to oppose all other forms of racism including genocide, different legal rights, and the physical segregation of races to prevent cultural contamination (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">some claim to have friends of other races</a>). However, they generally argue that that it's cruel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry">have mixed-race kids</a> because they see race as <em>the</em> sole/most important element of collective identity. This makes the existence of people who blur the boundaries between races distressing for people of those races, who will see their identity as being under threat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination">and in their illogical rage target</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">the unfortunate mixed-race children in their midst</a>. Of course, race is just one element of collective identity and while it can be very important to some people this is by no means a given. In general, mixed-race children tend to have about the same level of trouble that their parents have — less if they look like one race or the other instead of an obvious mixture, or live in a society that doesn't care about race.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Related to the above is that, much more than most other manifestations of racism, Whites are almost as likely to be victims as perpetrators. In other words, most Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Blacks, Mestizos etc. might be happy to have Whites as friends or business partners, but intermarriage would be crossing a line. (And let's not even go into how members of different non-White groups may view each other).
</p><p>In stories that take place in communities where "race" isn't a defining factor in classifying humanity (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">''some'' of</a> the 19th century USA, East Asia, or Russia), a "mixed marriage" could mean many other different things: mixed ethnicity ("ethnicity" here being vaguely synonymous with "nationality"), mixed religion, or mixed class. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, many of these other "mixed" marriages tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Tropes</a> in fiction (at least in the Anglosphere), though they do surface occasionally: consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></em>, which mines humor from the "scandal" of a ('white') Greek-American woman choosing a ('white') Anglo-American man as her husband... a thing no longer scandalous in the late 20th century, but most certainly <em>was</em> just a few decades previously.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, of course, as there are still people who feel this way. Although anti-miscegenation attitudes are not only found in the classic cases of dominant, traditional, "purity"-seeking communities. Notably, some minorities also vocalize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">disdain for "disloyalty"</a>, stemming from the considerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackGalOnWhiteGuyDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackGalOnWhiteGuyDrama">culture-driven</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhiteyAndMellowYellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhiteyAndMellowYellow">asymmetry in cross-race relationships</a> — a subtle but persistent visual reminder of imposed inferiority — and frustrations in changing the narrative over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFetish">discomforting perceptions of hyper-attractiveness</a> or lack thereof. Then there are some who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">simply pricks</a>. But any of these justifications can end up invoking the trope.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the third film, Inu-Yasha's parents are shown to have struggled with resentment over their relationship. While his mother is giving birth to him, she is killed by a man who hated the fact she married a demon. When his father arrives on the scene, he restores her to life with his sword, Tensaiga, and fights the man who killed her. Because he has been mortally injured by a previous battle, he and the murderer perish in the battle, but Inu-Yasha and his mother manage to escape with their lives. The few memories he has of his childhood before his mother died consist of his mother being isolated and him being rejected by others because of the situation.
</li><li> Shiori's parents, a human woman named Shizu and a bat-youkai father, suffered a great deal of persecution, even costing the father his life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">his own father</a>, Taigokumaru</span>.
</li><li> Jinenji's human mother was an outcast from the village and persecuted for having had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> husband and therefore a half-breed son. It's not until Jinenji finally has a reason to fight and ends up protecting the bullies as well as his mother and Kagome that the villagers accept both him and his mother. It's implied that Jinenji's mother's bitterness lasts a little longer, however.
</li></ul></li><li> A good part of the conflict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Lady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Lady">Lady</a></em> comes from Lynn Russell/Rin Midorikawa being born from one of these. Her dad Sir George Russell is an English nobleman, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a> Misuzu Midorikawa was a Japanese woman. For that not only she's bullied by her distant cousins Mary and Thomas, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's rejected by her paternal grandfather Lord Warbawn.

</li><li> Jun Hono from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>, the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>, is mentioned as having been bullied for being the child of a Japanese mother and an African-American father. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance">This was especially notable</a> for an anime during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">when issues like racism were rarely discussed in the Japanese media at all, let alone in children's programming</a>.
</li><li> Also a major source of conflict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>. Its made clear early on that Urd's father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">The Almighty</a> and her mother is Hild, Queen of Hell, and that she faces significant issues because of her mixed heritage. Turns out a rule enforcing this trope is why, and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the protagonist's sex drive was suppressed without his knowledge at the beginning of the manga to keep him from breaking that rule</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross</a></em> (aka the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>), the human Bowie and the alien Musica have a very difficult time with the opinions of others, much more so than Max and Miriya (Millia) did earlier in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Macross Saga</a>.

No one had a problem with them dating; the only drama was with Roy's reputation as a playboy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaikaraSanGaTooru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaikaraSanGaTooru">Haikara-san ga Tooru</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shinobu's parents weren't allowed to marry because the father was a high-ranked officer in the Japanese military and the mother was a German woman.

This is never commented on by anyone in the comics (although, in a novelization, Leetah initially finds the pale complexions of the Wolfriders unnerving and Moonshade is chagrined at the thought of tanning) as skin color is considered purely an "evolutionary benefit" (the elves evolve <em>fast</em>) and just kind of pretty. However, the fact that Cutter has animal ancestors (and is mortal as a result) is considered absolutely <em>disgusting</em> by some characters, including Leetah's former boyfriend Rayek, who tries to separate them. On the other hand, one of the reasons the <em>ElfQuest</em> animated cartoon never took off was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the network demanded</a> that this mixed marriage be changed, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto">the writers would have none of that</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sayonara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sayonara">Sayonara</a></em> (1957) features an American serviceman falling in love with a Japanese woman. He marries her, but federal laws prevent him from taking her to the United States, and the Air Force has strict regulations against intermarriage. This was probably the first American film to depict racial intermarriage at all, much less depict it sympathetically.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLetter">The Letter</a></em>, Leslie is not embarrassed to say that she cut Geoffrey Hammond out of their social circle after finding out he'd taken up with a Chinese woman. Everyone else in Singapore cites this as the reason why opinion turned against Hammond (the murder victim) and in favor of Leslie (his murderer) in her trial.
</li><li> The whole point of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LakeviewTerrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LakeviewTerrace">Lakeview Terrace</a></em>. An interracial couple move in next door to a racist cop, who proceeds to terrorize them and try to drive them out of the neighborhood. Unusually, for this trope, the cop is black, and resents the couple because his wife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cheated on him with her white boss and died in a car accident trying to get to her boss' house</span>.
</li><li> It's the reason behind the Vampire/Lycan war in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003">Underworld (2003)</a></em> series. Lucian, a Lycan, falls in love with and secretly weds Sonja, who happens to be the daughter of a Vampire Elder. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Said Elder has Sonja (and her and Lucian's unborn child) put to death, Lucian swears revenge</span>, and it's all downhill from there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolate">Chocolate</a></em> the main character is the product of one of these between a Japanese yakuza and an enforcer in the Thai mob. They eventually part ways in order to avoid their enemies, even though they still love one another.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomethingNew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomethingNew">Something New</a></em> has a successful black businesswoman falling in love with a white landscaper and her parents not exactly approving as they'd prefer her to be with someone of her own race (and class.)

Except on the part of Royal himself, though he may have just been upset about her (re)marrying ANYONE and simply been playing up the race angle in order to offend and provoke Glover's character.
</li><li> The short mockumentary <em>White Face</em> is premised on the idea that performers who appear to be wearing white greasepaint (clowns, etc.) are <em>not</em> wearing makeup; that's a racial trait, and they suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> for it. In the film, various "Clown-Americans" are interviewed, including a Vietnam War veteran, a college professor, and a recent immigrant (who communicates in his "native language" with a bicycle horn). There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacistGrandma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacistGrandma">Racist Clown Grandma</a> who is upset that her grandchild is about to marry.... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesMimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesMimes">a mime</a>.
</li><li> In the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>, Pinks's Hammer army attacks a mixed race couple, viciously beats the black man, and rapes the white woman. This goes very well with the nazi-esque themes that appeared in the previous song ("In The Flesh").
</li><li> This is subverted in <em>The Feast of All Saints</em> (movie and book) as <em>placage</em> (an "official" relationship between a white man and a free woman of color in antebellum New Orleans whereby he was required to take care of her and any children in exchange for sex) was fully supported while marriages between people of color of different stations was seriously frowned on.
</li><li> Hinted at in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a></em>, when Cole sees three hanged ghosts: a black man, a white woman, and a child who is clearly meant to be their own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em> sort of emulates this trope between Penny and Seaweed, except they're dating, not married. Penny's mother is a racist who shows disgust at her inter-racial relationship, and it is mentioned that they'll have a lot of animosity from the residents of bigoted Baltimore, but don't care.

Upon receiving the news, Emmi's three children disown her, one going so far as to kick in the screen to her TV in a fit of rage. Her neighbors mock her, her coworkers shun her, the corner grocer deliberately humiliates Ali, and the staff at a bistro simply stand and stare at the couple while they try to have lunch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AManForAllSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AManForAllSeasons">A Man for All Seasons</a></em>, the Catholic Thomas More objected to his daughter marrying a heretic.

Derek's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> ex-girlfriend Nikki meanwhile sharply disapproves because she thinks white girls are responsible for "stealing" the few decent black men around (as Derek is a good student who stays out of criminal activities).

Early in the film while at a dinner with English expats, the host talks about a sister of his who married a Chinese man. Although it makes him appear quite liberal, his daughter reveals the story is made up and he later blackmails the artist when he dates the titular Suzie over his own daughter — stating that it'll be hard for him to get a good job if he's married to a Chinese woman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians">Crazy Rich Asians</a></em> is unique in that both partners are of the same race — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">they're both Chinese</a> — but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">drastically different classes</a>.

Illogical but understandable-a human choosing to live according to Vulcan ways is a compliment, a Vulcan who isn't quite on the other hand is kind of creepy.

Unfortunately all of this happened in the years leading to Equatorial Guinea's independence, and she has to go into hiding. When she goes back to the plantation, she has born him a son, and he even sees her older son, fathered by another man, almost as his own. When Equatorial Guinea gains its independence, Spanish nationals are forcibly expelled, when he tries to take her with him aboard the ship bound for Spain, the soldiers guarding the dock force him to board but say the she and the children must stay. When he says she's his wife, they threaten to open fire if he doesn't board by himself. After the massacre at the port, they manage to escape, they stay together for a few years before she encourages him to go back to Spain. Years later, after she died, her sons finally make the trip to reunite with their father.

Her sister Tina only disapproves because its illegal, she doesnt care that hes a No-Maj. Grindelwald actually uses this to lure Queenie to his side in the climax of the second film as he says if he takes over and tears down the International Statute of Secrecy, the two of them will be free to be together.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s Middle Earth, human-elf marriages are widely accepted. But the very first such couple, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">Beren and Lúthien</a>, first had to overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> of Lúthien's father Thingol, who considered any mortal beneath his daughter and made totally impossible demands (go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a>, cut a Silmaril from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>'s crown, and give it to me). Considering Thingol himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">married to an angel</a> (one who <em>didn't</em> object to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonhumanHumanoidHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonhumanHumanoidHybrid">her daughter</a> marrying a human), you'd <em>think</em> he'd be more accepting, but nooooo. Admittedly, in the case of Beren and Luthien the racial difference is unusually relevant: After Beren dies of old age, Luthien's soul passed out of the world with his instead of joining the other elven souls in the Halls of Mandos. This made Luthien the first elf ever to truly die, and Thingol knew, apparently due to some level of prophecy, that this would happen should Luthien marry a human.
</li><li> However, after Beren and Lúthien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">did the impossible</a> anyway and got married, subsequent elf-human marriages met no opposition. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinzHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeinzHybrid">Their descendant</a> Elrond merely expected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Aragorn</a> to help defeat Sauron and make Middle-earth a safe place to live before agreeing to leave his daughter Arwen there for the rest of her life. And considering his wife was once abducted and tortured to death by orcs <em>while on vacation</em>, his concerns look pretty understandable. There was also the simple question of status: she was elven royalty after all, even if Rivendell isn't a traditional kingdom.

Even in this case, it's not so much that mixed marriages are morally or socially wrong — Gwindor is simply reminding Finduilas that falling in love with Túrin is likely to cause both of them grief, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">one is immortal and the other isn't</a>.

<div class="indent">"The city knows how to deal with... inconvenient kings. But an heir to the throne who is <em>actually</em> called Rex?"
</div></li><li> A patriarch in Lancre is named <em>Miscegenation Carter</em> as part of as due a misconceived naming tradition (as girls are often named for virtues, then boys should be named for vices; his descendants have names like Chastity and Charity for girls, and Bestiality Carter and Murder Carter for boys. Thing is, every single member of the lineage becomes the <em>opposite</em> of their name). This suggests the concept of miscegenation is known on the Disc and at least in the past attracted the same opprobrium and social stigma as murder, rape, bestiality, etc.

<ul><li> The reaction softens somewhat according to region. In the (more conservative, less populated) north, a romance like Dag and Fawn's is completely unknown. In the south, where there are larger farmer communities, it apparently happens once or twice a year. However, while the southern Lakewalkers have given in to the inevitability of such things happening, farmers still are not allowed to live in Lakewalker settlements, so a Lakewalker who marries a farmer is leaving their society forever.

A many-time-great aunt, Iola, was also burned off the family tree for marrying a muggle called Bob Hitchens.
</li><li> Hagrid's parents, a human wizard and a giantess, split up when he was young and she remarried a giant with whom she had his half-brother, Grawp. His on-and-off girlfriend Madame Maxine is also a half-giant, but she hides it from even Hagrid because she doesn't want to face the discrimination Hagrid does.
</li><li> Lupin initially rejects Tonks because he knows that being in a relationship with a werewolf would negatively affect her life. He was right. Voldemort himself brings up their marriage to mock Tonks's (estranged) family, and her aunt Bellatrix becomes even more determined to kill Tonks than she was before. And she was pretty determined already.
</li><li> Surprisingly, Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour get a free pass (from everyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveObstructingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveObstructingParents">his mother</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">his sister</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Hermione</a>) even though Fleur is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">a quarter-veela</a> and even worse, <em>French</em>.

She notes that a lot of girls at school give her dirty looks when she kisses Chris, as if Chris shouldn't be dating someone like her. On the other end of things, Starr's father, Maverick, disapproves when black people date white people, considering it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">a betrayal</a>.

</li><li> Jasper Fforde's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadesOfGrey">Shades of Grey</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> version of this trope. As far as we know, Chromatacian society has no taboos against interracial marriage (though it's not entirely clear whether <em>Homo coloribus</em> even <em>has</em> separate ethnicities of the sort <em>Homo sapiens</em> does). Instead, their taboo is against relationships between people who can see complementary colors (i.e. a relationship between someone who can see red and someone who can see green, or between a Purple and a Yellow). This is so ingrained that when Tommy offers to procure Eddie a prostitute of whatever color he likes, he immediately specifies that <em>of course</em> that doesn't include complementary-color relationships. Likewise, despite explicitly being dissidents and rebels against Chomatacian culture, Jane and Eddie immediately break off their engagement upon discovering that they're complementary, and Eddie feels nauseous for having so much as had romantic <em>thoughts</em> towards Jane.

Bothan leader Borsk Fey'lya however also disapproves of Bothan pilot Asyr Sei'lar having a relationship with Human Gavin Darklighter, not only because he dislikes Humans, but due to feeling she's setting a poor example with other Bothans as a result. He pressures her into breaking their relationship off by threatening to use his political power toward this if she doesn't. Before this, the pair had discussed marriage and adopting children (since they can't reproduce naturally). Asyr reluctantly complies, but both she and Gavin still bear a grudge against Fey'lya for this many years later.

After a while, they decide to get married, despite the constant dirty looks and comments they keep getting from <em>both</em> sides. Prior to the wedding, their parents meet, and it turns out that neither Rose's mother Susan nor Atticus's father Daniel wish for the union to take place. Rose's parents are about to be divorced, but her father Hugh insists that they keep the truth from both Rose and their future in-laws, for the time being. Susan even stages a scene during Atticus's stag party to imply his infidelity, but this fails to dissuade Rose. Daniel claims that Atticus is renouncing his Jewish heritage by marrying a gentile woman and that, by Jewish tradition, their children cannot be considered Jewish (the mother must be Jewish), although Atticus claims they can convert. At the altar, Susan reveals the truth about their upcoming divorce as a last-ditch effort to stop the wedding, only for Atticus's mother Rachel to thank her for the revelation and urge the event to continue. When Daniel moves in to say something indignant about this, Rachel warns him that he will be the one facing a divorce if he so much as utters a word in protest.

What makes this inconsistent is that the <em>entire first season</em> came and went without Lucious giving any indication that he had a problem with Rhonda, and by all accounts, he respected her as his daughter-in-law and included her in private family functions. Given his interactions with his other sons Jamal and Hakeem, it seemed he didn't care if they dated outside their race as long as they weren't gay, but suddenly Rhonda was a problem.

This led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the infamous Red Wedding, where Robb, his mother, his wife and unborn child, and his bannermen were massacred</span>. The Freys reasoning is that Robb rejected a political alliance with them not for marrying a foreigner. But in Season 6, some Northern houses, such as House Glover, refused to join Sansa and Jons mission to reclaim Winterfell from Ramsey Bolton because theyre bitter of Robbs bad political decisions most especially his marriage to Talisa which Lord Glover called her a "foreign whore". This is in contrast to the books where Robb married Jeyne Westerling, who is from a Westerland house under the Lannisters, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">he took her virginity</a> while having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace">Sex for Solace</a> after learning his younger brothers supposed deaths.

A young white man has married a black woman, even though his dad absolutely hates the idea (to the point of beating his son).

Eventually Cassie's father killed him in self-defence, and conspired to cover up the incident because he feared lynching.

</li><li> There's the story of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phinehas#Anti-miscegenation_interpretation">Phinehas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a priest who simultaneously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">speared</a> an Israelite man and a Midianite woman he was having sex with in one thrust. Some interpret this to be an anti-intermarriage story. However, the killing may have had something to do with the fact that they were having sex on the steps of the Tabernacle. For what it's worth, Jewish tradition claims that <em>Phinehas</em>' mom was a Midianite (a daughter of Jethro), so the race thing was presumably not that important. This has not stopped the racist interpretation, of course.
</li><li> Way back in Old Testament times the Jews were of <em>the same ethnicity</em> as most of the surrounding peoples they were forbidden to marry but 'intermarriage' was forbidden in order to stop their assimilation of local religious practices (there were positively regarded cases of intermarriage where both spouses practiced Judaism or at least reverence of Yahweh). As with many other laws the restriction was progressively emphasized over the years while the reasons and context faded into obscurity.
</li><li> And of course, there were exceptions— Joseph married Asenath, the daughter of an Egyptian priest, without raising any eyebrows; Moses is described as being married to a Midianite woman named Tzipporah and a Cushite (possibly the same person, possibly a case of polygamy), while the Midianite Ruth married two Jewish men. Both cases were controversial, but God never disparaged Moses and Ruth is the ancestress of King David.
</li><li> Then, of course, there is Solomon and his many paramours, who include an Egyptian princess, other pagans and (in popular tradition) the Queen of Sheba. In the First Book of Kings, this intermarriage is said to be the reason why his regime eventually turned bad (since they are blamed in leading him to worship other gods).
</li><li> And this is still a huge issue among Jews, in particular in Israel, where there were <em>state-sponsored commercials</em> made to avoid having Israeli Jews leaving the country to marry a non-Jewish foreigner. Fortunately there were a lot of protests against those, but the problem is still incredibly prevalent.
</li></ul></li><li> This is prominent in non-Muslim minorities in the Middle-East. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze">Druze<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazidis">Yazidis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who marry outside of their religion are promptly excommunicated, since they are considered to be converted to their religion of their spouse. This is particularly bad, as they are usually Arabic speakers, which makes settling in Jewish areas (if theyre Israeli) much more difficult if not altogether impossible, and settling in an Arab area would subject them to stigmas. While Arab Christians aren't subjected to the same level of scrutiny, it's very frowned upon to marry outside their community even to other kinds of Christians. One example would be the Assyrians and Copts, who are currently in diaspora and the reason why they marry inside their faith is to preserve their distinct culture and marrying to an Orthodox Greek (who shares a similar denomination) would be disapproved of.
</li><li> Until relatively recently, this same stigma was attached to Catholics who married non-Catholics.
</li><li> A Christian marrying a non-Christian is known as being "unequally yoked." Some Protestant churches have been known to refuse to marry a Christian to a non-Christian, though this policy varies from church to church. Christianity not being limited to race though, most churches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> judgmental attitudes towards racially mixed marriages. However, the issue was of course different in say the Southern US before the 1960s, when such marriages were not only refused by most white churches, but also illegal. The same was true in South Africa up to 1985, when interracial marriage was decriminalized.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a> forbids Muslim men from marrying idol worshippers. It should be noted that contrary to popular belief, <a class="urllink" href="https://submission.org/marriage_in_Quran.html">nowhere in the scripture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> forbids Muslim women from marrying Jews or Christians like their male counterparts. In both Islam and Christianity, there are verses that explicitly state that there is virtually no racial or national border for marriage.
</li><li> A similar case within the Sikh community; mixed marriages between Sikhs and non-Sikhs are not well received.

Their respective clergies support rival gods and thus see the marriage as well as the offspring as utterly irredeemable. It escalates into a full-blown conflict as both factions actively hunt the family, which eventually results in Omaroch's capture and subsequent torture and brainwashing by demons, Delora's apparent death at the hands of human clerics and one of the children being sold into slavery. The tragic chain of events later repeats itself when the aforementioned couple's half-demon son Refan marries the human warrior Skye. The human clergy sets its eyes on the couple not only because they once again see such a union as taboo but also because they want to capture and use Refan and his son for a more sinister purpose.

The two men have a fairly bitter row about the matter early in the story: More declares that the man whom Roper now follows, Martin Luther, is an excommunicant; and Roper retorts, basically, that it's a mark of pride to be excommunicated from a bastard church.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with the asari, who prefer that members of their race mate outside their species (as they can reproduce with any other species and gender) for the purposes of reproduction. Asari view asari-exclusive pairings that result in offspring similar to how contemporary society views incest, especially these pairings have a greater chance of producing dangerous genetic disorders. It's also mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> for the planet Tevura that asari are strongly exogamic, inclined to seek mates who are outside of their kinship group to prevent mating with relatives.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, an asari who has married a krogan comes under fire, a little bit, for that, though it's more about how krogan are considered mindless brutes than the relationship itself.
</li><li> In the third game there's an overheard conversation between a (female) human soldier and asari embassy staff. The human is trying to get the asari to give refuge to her young daughter before she goes into combat, as her asari wife has already been deployed. When the staff ask why the daughter can't stay with the human's family, the soldier retorts that they disowned her for marrying an asari; did the staffmember think there was any chance they'd take in her asari daughter?
</li><li> Actually averted in one of the Romance subplots. The humans don't get along very well with the turians, because humanity's first contact with them resulted in a small war (an incident, really). A female Commander Shepard can enter a romantic relationship with a turian, but no protests are ever heard.
<ul><li> Same is done with the Quarian romance. Quarians are normally depicted as universally despised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews">Space Jews</a> (though they more closely resemble the Romani people), but male Shepard and Tali don't get any flak from anyone, though Tali does confess that her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">late</span> father would probably have disapproved of her being in a relationship with a human.
</li><li> It's implied in both of the above cases that Shepard is simply so highly respected by his/her crewmates that even the more bigoted members of the <em>Normandy</em> crew wouldn't dare insult his/her relationship. Regardless, Shepard <em>is</em> the commanding officer of the ship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Any active-duty Tropers are welcome to ask such questions of their CO</a>.

</li><li> In Rivenspire, one dungeon's story centers around an Orc woman who fell in love and married a Redguard man, against the customs of her tribe (which dictated that she would be betrothed to the chief's son). The chief's son sent attackers to hunt them down and kill them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">To say the Orc woman is angry at potential harm to her mate would be an understatement.</a>

</li><li> Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>, human-elf couples are looked down on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>. One issue is that half-elves don't exist in this setting — all children born to human-elf couples are humans. So there's pressure in elven communities for elves to stick with elves to keep the race from dying out. If Merrill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> is romanced, she will bring this up and worries that this is yet another way she is "failing" her people.
</li><li> Mentioned during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> quest to open one of the endgame Hard Mode dungeons. You're directed to a pair of adventurers that tried clearing out the dungeon once but were patched up by the Tonberries when you managed to clear it out first in the normal mode. It's quickly stated that the two are lovers and are adventurers because they were kicked out of their home village due to one of them being a Miqo'te and the other Hyur and that the tonberries are nice people and need help for not caring about this. What is NEVER mentioned in dialogue however is the fact that both of them are male. Apparently mixed species relations are more taboo than homosexual ones?
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter">Fallout Shelter</a>:</em> black, white and brown Vault Dwellers have no problems having children with each other, which is mildly surprising when you remember that Fallout society is like 1950s USA, only more so. The developers probably decided that dealing with MMM wouldn't fit in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> iOS game.
<ul><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantPrologue">pre-War sequence</a> at the beginning, as you're running towards the Vault with your family, you may notice that one of the neighbouring houses is owned by a lesbian couple where one partner is white and the other is black. It's unknown if they made it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfMordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfMordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a></em>: While not focused during the story due to Talion's wife Ioreth being dead at the start of the game, its revealed in the background (as detailed by loading screens) that their marriage faced scrutiny from her father Hallas because she was of Numenorean descent like most nobles of Gondor, while Talion was a lowborn Northman that was born and raised in their kingdom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>: According to Carson, the Tribe of Darkness lived in seclusion to protect their magic from foreign contamination out of pride.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ThereSheIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ThereSheIs">There she is!!</a></em>, features a rabbit and a cat who begin a relationship in a community that is against the two species mixing. The negative sentiment against such romances is initially played for laughs, but is treated far more seriously in the second half.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RainbowDashPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RainbowDashPresents">Rainbow Dash Presents</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyLittleDashie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyLittleDashie">My Little Dashie</a></em> Jokermort (a monkey) falls in love with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Rainbow Dash</a> (a pegasus).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Avialae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Avialae">Avialae</a></em>, Gannet's mother was a member of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> race who fell in love with a human man and was exiled from her society as a result. Gannet, who was raised by humans and initially didn't even know he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> until his wings started sprouting, similarly falls in love with the fully human Bailey and has to fight to secretly keep him by his side when he enters the avialae's hidden city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BadMoonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BadMoonRising">Bad Moon Rising</a></em> has Nike and Dale, a mixed hunter/werewolf pair who are ostracized in both communities, though on the werewolf side, it may have more to do with Dale having previously shot Nike's mother with silver bird shot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BloodBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BloodBank">Blood Bank</a></em>, the vampire elite hold humans in contempt, using them as underpaid workers, slaves and even disposable blood supplies. When the daughter of an influential vampire genuinely falls in love with a human slave and ends up pregnant with his child, they are forced to run for their lives.
</li><li> The main protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GoblinHollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GoblinHollow">Goblin Hollow</a></em> is a bear. His wife is a cougar. Certain people don't approve. Only her grandparents on her mother's side truly disapprove. Her parents understand the problem since the same grandparents had a fit when Lily's mountain lion mother married her African lion father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell">Kevin &amp; Kell</a></em> is about a multi-species family headed by a rabbit (Kevin) married to a wolf (Kell). Society at large doesn't get it. While interspecies relationships are fine (except for the particularly extreme Institute for Species Purity) — the taboo comes from intermarriage between predator and prey species. Other controversial pairings feature a wolf and a sheep, and a cat and a mouse.
<ul><li> One of Kevin's sisters who originated in a parallel reality (of Humans) said that his marriage to Kell is just as controversial back home (though the mix is left unstated). Danielle also notes how interesting it is that <em>diet</em> is the arbitrary distinction that causes these type of pairings, after seeing no one raise an eyebrow at lesbian couple Rachel and Joan (who are both herbivores, so an 'acceptable' pairing in Domain society).
<div class="indent"><strong>Danielle:</strong> I guess a society can only use one pointless, arbitrary division at a time! Anyway, I guess I'm just raising more questions than I'm answering. <br/><strong>Kevin:</strong> Like, what's an eyebrow?
</div></li><li> Of note is that there were actually <em>two</em> wolf/sheep pairings, the first leading directly to the conception of the sheep in the second pairing. And that second pairing got extra controversy cause the wolf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransNature">converted to herbivorism and now presents as a ram</a>. Him being trans-diet gets him extra scrutiny from the social worker on his adopted daughter's case.
</li><li> Angelique and RL (another rabbit/wolf pairing) got around the taboo part. Since Angelique's rabbit license was revoked for spilling secrets to RL, she was now considered a long eared rodent. So she got plastic surgery and posed as a rat.
</li><li> Of course, there's also a carnivore supremacy terrorist group that doesn't want <em>any</em> hybrids of any sort, even within the same dietary categories, which is why they targeted Fenton (a bat) and Lindesfarne (hedgehog <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and born human</span>): they had a hybrid daughter.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Aby and Mark. While MOUSCAR played up the fact that he was a mouse dating a cat to the hilt, other mice treat Aby with suspicion, and they had to jump through hoops before the social worker (same one mentioned above) would let them adopt Mark's nephew Tyler.
</li><li> And now a lion/rhino pairing can be added to this list, as Carl (the rhino), who was projected to go in the third round of the professional gardening draft, was only taken in the sixth round (And by the worst team in the league) because other teams refused to sign him because they thought he was taking a risk in being engaged to Leona (the lion). An outraged Carl vows to make them regret it by taking the Tidewater Pitchforks to the top. Time will tell if he makes good.
</li></ul></li><li> Fuschia receives a good bit of this from Seymour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em> for her relationship with Criminy (although it's more for her just being a Devil Girl than anything else). Blue is also disapproving but willing to accept it because Fuschia is happy. While the strip indicates the Devil doesn't know about it yet, the implication is that it will not likely be pleasant for them when he finds out. Otherwise generally averted.
</li><li> Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between angels and demons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SlightlyDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SlightlyDamned">Slightly Damned</a></em>, there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">quite a bit of tension</a> between the two. It's so bad that one particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> tried to kill Kieri, an angel, just for being friends with Buwaro, a demon — so their later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> is regarded as odd at best. While this trope has yet to actually occur in the comic, Kieri expresses fear about what will happen when her family finds out about it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.housepetscomic.com/comic/2014/08/01/dont-know-when-ill-be-back-again/">One comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Housepets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Housepets">Housepets!</a></em> has Bruce telling Roosevelt that his parents probably won't approve of him being in a relationship with a <em>grey</em> kangaroo.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace">Arthur, King of Time and Space</a></em> strip opened in the medieval arc, where Argrivaine was complaining about marriage across class lines, offering the familiar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySlopeFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySlopeFallacy">Slippery Slope Fallacy</a> that people would marry horses next. Arthur says that if the horse is sentient and can give consent, why not? Cut to the space arc, where Agrivaine is watching in horror as a woman marries a humanoid horse.
</li><li> Zigzagged and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SabrinaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SabrinaOnline">Sabrina Online</a></em> in which there are a number of such pairings, all with their own issues. Carly the Chinchilla is seriously worried about having a baby by her wolf husband Spike, given the size disparity (he is routinely depicted with his head out of the top of the panel, to demonstrate his height), but it is never resolved. Sabrina and her boyfriend, later husband, RC the raccoon, dont really encounter this, except from her mother - her father is much more accepting, given that RC is actually quite a good husband. Amy Squirrel and her boyfriend, later husband Thomas Wolfe go through various fourth wall issues about how unfeasible it all is.

Paulo Abacar the Elder (Brazilian ex-slave) married Aisha (Fulani) as he founded the Sokoto Republic, while Souleymane (Senegalese) married Chiara (French-Italian Jew) as he settled in Paris. Their sons and daughters continued this tradition up until the present day. It also helps that most of the spouses had no (or few) close family members around when the vows were said. It should be noted that there are a few people who <em>do</em> think badly of mixed marriages, most notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsar Alexander, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">fell out with his daughter Anastasia</a> after she resolved to marry Prince Tewodros of Ethiopia</span>.
