<div class="indent">— <strong>Seiji Mizushima</strong>, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>
</div></div><p>Someone who is involved in the production of a work is known for interacting with the fans. For example, they take some time writing a production blog or answering fandom's questions, or regularly appear at conventions. All of a sudden, this person stops doing so because some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">fans</a> become so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">thick and heavy</a> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">ugly</a></em>) that this previously fun activity has become a burden and is no longer enjoyable. In some cases, they may end up with bodily harm (or face a threat thereof) by the absolute worst of the unpleasable fans.

</p><p>The fans complain to and about the creator, hassle them to an unbearable level, constantly ask questions that the creator has already stated they will not be answering, and generally do obnoxious things in the name of their fandom. Because a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">small handful</a> are ruining it for everyone else, the creator stops whatever fun interaction with the fans they were having. This may give the rest of the fans the impression that said creator is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor">Nice Character, Mean Actor</a>, even though it wasn't the fault of the creator at all. This can be especially true for those who act respectfully and were unaware of any other fans causing problems. In many cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">this may result in a no-win situation for a creator</a>: attempt to avoid the bad fans, and the fans hate them; alienate the good fans, and the fans hate them.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is <em>especially</em> bad towards things that people actually do as a hobby, or out of personal enjoyment. Many a rant has been made by harassed creators/producers/personalities/celebrities who state that they actually could be off doing better things or that their life is already stressful enough with their other job(s) that they really don't need to come home from a long day's work just to be hassled. And many a rant towards pirates have been made saying that they actually need to make money or else they won't be able to produce further installments.
</p><p>Complaints often arise from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a>. For example, it's been pointed out that few people who do webcomics actually make <em>money</em> off of them, with most of them doing it as a hobby. When things in real life pop up, such as health issues, it's always the webcomic that has to go first. Sometimes nothing was done to the creator; instead, the fans did something <em>for</em> the creator that caused even more headaches. Maybe the creator had a copyright dispute and the fans responded by DDoSing the other party. Maybe the creator got into a feud with the creator of a rival work or a big name critic and the fans responded with harassment towards that party. Maybe the creator actually was screwed by someone else and the fans responded with threats and the posting of the offending party's personal information. It doesn't matter what their intentions were; if the actions of the fans result in the creator deciding to wash their hands of them because their actions caused an even bigger headache, this is in effect.

The problem mainly came from two incidents: the first problem was when she discovered that the reason why she had so many international fans respond to her was because of unofficial translations when a fan commented on Chapter 69 before <em>Margaret</em>, the magazine that published <em>Daytime Shooting Star</em>, went on sale in Japan. The second problem was the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">Ship-to-Ship Combat</a> as the series was concluding, where international fans kept leaving very heated comments on her Twitter account. The pressure got to the point where she had to put it on private until the final chapter was published. Today, she rarely responds to her fans, especially if the comments are not in Japanese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> is considered one of the better dubs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> produced, since the series wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> as much as other works that 4Kids had under their umbrella. However, since <em>Shaman King</em> revolved around death and featured heavy violence, it also attracted ire from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> at the time. Coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">having a bad timeslot</a> and the company's not-so-positive reputation, this is what caused <em>Shaman King</em> to flop in the United States, and is ultimately what led 4Kids to continue their usual censorship and localization practices for future dubs.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ewbz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ewbz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ewbz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Their next dub was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, which is infamous among anime fans as one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekred</a> English dubs in anime history.</span>

Those paper boards were being raffled around at online auctions.
</li><li> Due to manga having a reputation for being frequent targets for theft, Barnes &amp; Noble responded by putting sensor tags, the ones usually reserved for electronics, inside the back cover. Anyone who buys these then faces the tough decision of keeping them in with the annoying added thickness, or try and remove them and risk ripping the page. Then you get the loiterers who treat said manga section as a library and throw the books on the floor after they're done damaging the merchandise for actual customers. As such, a different form of security tag are specifically used, which has a minimal risk of damaging the book itself.

Flynn just couldn't take the shipper comments anymore. Penders becoming the anti-Christ in the fandom's eyes, which led to them throwing multiple insults his way, also didn't go over well with Flynn since he felt it made everyone look bad, especially himself and Archie; Flynn banned any mention of Penders on threats of being kicked off his forum if fans abuse it. This also killed a thread on his board talking about the <em>Lara-Su Chronicles</em> after fans went into a panic over a number of tweets over the man leading them to think he was trying to outright kill the <em>Sonic</em> comic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders">His page on this very wiki</a> is locked because of this.

Combined with former writer Gene Luen Yang saying that some of Azula's fans were crazy to the point of scaring her away from trying to write for the character, and there's little hope for any extensive comic content about Azula.

One wonders if this was self-referential on Warren Ellis' part.

</li><li> Rumor has it that one of the reasons Watterson stopped doing <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> was because his "fans" effectively stole the trademark for Calvin away from him. You know all of those cutesy "Calvin is praying" or "Calvin is Peeing on Something" stickers you see on the back windows of all those trucks and cars? They weren't authorized by Watterson (who licensed a very small amount of merchandise, and nothing like those stickers). By the time the cartoonist found out about them and moved to stop their production, they'd become so ubiquitous and widespread that a judge told him he'd effectively lost his own trademark because he didn't act fast enough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> states that people selling such things were forced to change the caricature to avoid infringement.

Marshak's kinks soon came to dominate the project, and Lichtenberg, in awe of Marshak's "incredible mind", abandoned most of the plot plans for the second half of <em>Kraith</em>, which was never completed. Fan writers who wanted to add their own work to <em>Kraith</em> had to not just follow the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130201180243/http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/kraith/kcm/index.html">Kraith Creators Manual<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> but have their work vetted by an increasing number of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Kraith_Creators">Kraith Creators<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (including Marshak) through the <a class="urllink" href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Kraith_Round_Robin">Kraith Round Robin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which all the Creators would have a chance to read and comment (repeatedly) on your story.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1eo2y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1eo2y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1eo2y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lichtenberg's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarionZimmerBradley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarionZimmerBradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>-esque belief that the only good criticism was "acid-tipped language, scathing rebukes and searing putdowns" couldn't have helped.</span> In those days, when you couldn't email and cc everyone, the bureaucracy of the stories was unbelievable.

The guidelines state that all creators, actors and all other participants must genuinely and deliberately consist only of amateurs, can't be compensated for their services, and can't be currently and/or previously employed in any <em>Star Trek</em> media or any of CBS nor Paramount Pictures licensees. Crowdfunding is allowed... but it has a hard cap of $50000. The fan-films must also be up to 15 minutes long or in two parts that, when combined, cannot go beyond half an hour, with no follow-ups or remakes whatsoever, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">even if</a> <em>Star Trek</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment">is removed in the follow up or remake</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">to try and cheat that rule</a>.

The harassment was then leveled towards <em>the actual crew</em> when they called the drawings "artistic interpretation" in an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">defuse the situation</a>.
</li><li> The reason that the development of reliable modding tools for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em> (and <em>Deluxe</em>) is stalled is because of tons of low-effort mods or unreasonable requests that only contribute some cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> montages to that game's modding community.

</li><li> A number of people who rip models from licensed games with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen">Frozen</a></em> characters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogamePerversityPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogamePerversityPotential">concerns over pornographic works</a> and the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName">Elsanna</a>" fan ship between protagonists Elsa and Anna (which is highly controversial, as it concerns an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">incestuous relationship</a> between two sisters). As a result, these model rippers either put their rips under a restrictive license which prevents people from using the models in M-rated works, or keep the models entirely to themselves. While said models aren't even theirs to begin with and it's still possible for them to get a cease-and-desist, the restrictions are put in place largely because they don't want to risk attracting any more unnecessary attention from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s legal team with raunchy <em>Frozen</em> edits.

He would personally update his Twitter multiple times daily with songs that he liked, poetry, interesting/funny things from fans, and so on; and he had spend quite a bit of time with them when in-person, taking time out to sign every autograph and take every picture requested of him. However, one too many transgressions from "fans" caused Hiddleston to suddenly become notably distant. Such incidents included: camping en masse outside his hotel when shooting on location, constantly linking him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">Rule 34</a> fanart of himself, tricking him into meeting with them by posing as someone he worked with (similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a> example above), <em>posting his home address online</em>, and immediately flooding any woman that was photographed alongside him with death threats.

Most versions of the story even single it out as the reason why he hasn't appeared on the big screen (except for a 3D re-release of the same film) for a very long time since.

While he gave it his full blessing early on, mentioned (and hence promoted) it in a <em>Callahan's</em> story, and made the odd official contribution from time to time, this was always done offline and/or through third parties — if he has ever posted to the group, it was never under any alias that could have been penetrated. This careful policy probably owes something to the aftermath of <em>Pyotrs Story</em> (published 1981), which was set on Callahans weekly riddle night, and ended with an invitation for readers to write in with answers to the unsolved riddles. Result: sackloads of mail. And while the flow did tail off, it has never ceased entirely. He's also publicly said that he's seriously worried that if he got involved with the alt.callahans, he'd spend too much time there when he <em>should</em> be writing more stories.

She even posted the first chapter on her website, to whet fans' appetites. Then a half-finished manuscript appeared on the Internet, posted by someone she'd trusted enough to give a copy to.

Some people took issue with it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">which is reasonable</a>, but those that did almost exclusively blamed her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">which</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">isn't</a>. The result was a massive multi-board <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> that included both sides insulting each other, hate sites, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">Dear Negative Reader</a> posts, coining of derogatory nicknames for their detractors, accusations of favoritism/nepotism/sexual bribery, and ultimately culminated when one nutjob made a machinima video of himself brutally murdering a mock Traviss and her fans over his concern for the numbers (and disingenuously called it "satire"), which made the StarWars.com board moderators nuke everything associated with the...

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> stopped touring in 1966. The complexity of some post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver">Revolver</a></em> tracks exceeding what could be performed live and a simultaneous boredom with repeatedly playing their (by that point) years-old set was part of it, but another factor was that their fans went so crazy whenever they showed up that they couldn't hear themselves play over the sound of the hysterical shrieking, were trapped in their hotel rooms by mobbing fans whenever they went anywhere, and had to be ferried around in armored cars to prevent being torn apart in the near-rioting that surrounded them. Another factor was the Christian Fundamentalist-driven anti-Beatles hysteria that emerged after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s alleged "we're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus">Bigger Than Jesus</a>" comments (which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a>), complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookBurning">record burnings</a>, boycotts and picketing of Beatles concerts; these convinced the band that touring the U.S. wasn't worth it, as they'd just have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> dogging them at nearly every leg of the tour. John at this time confessed that his worst fear was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">someone shooting him</a>. The last straw was probably an incident at a concert in Memphis where an audience member threw a firecracker on stage. No one was harmed, but for a split second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">everyone thought the loud noise was a gunshot</a>.

With the relationship soured, they'll probably never do this again.
</li><li> This is, quite likely, the reason why most music-formatted radio stations no longer freely play song requests. Of course, this doesn't stop the frequent complaints of "you never play this song" coming from the listeners — but it is now easier for the radio programmers and disc jockeys to ignore them, and just program what <em>they</em> want to play. That is, if there even <em>are</em> announcer-programmers or disc jockeys at the station. Much contemporary radio runs on station branding (e.g., "Jack FM") — a prepackaged format that is often automated and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-tracking">voice-tracked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to sound local, yet another example of this.

It seemed like typical out-of-touch rockstar behavior... that is, until the band posted the <em>rest</em> of the story. Essentially, the dude was a known autograph hunter whose modus operandi involved going up to bands, acting like he was a fan who just wanted a keepsake, getting autographs, and then turning around and selling the signed items on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">eBay</a>. On top of that, Protest the Hero had been burned by this same guy before and were not going to fall for his act again.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GodspeedYouBlackEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GodspeedYouBlackEmperor">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>'s demo tape <em>All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling</em> is perhaps the holy grail of indie fans. It's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>, so it will never be reissued, and was limited to 33 copies, so the chances of a copy surfacing are naturally highly unlikely. And yet, in 2013, one did surface. The person who had it surfaced on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> and was ready to rip it and distribute it. Two songs were posted and confirmed to be genuine. And then people drove him off by being assholes, to the point where he deleted his account. The remaining songs have yet to surface.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteamPoweredGiraffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteamPoweredGiraffe">Steam Powered Giraffe</a> started reaching this point with their fans, growing more and more detached from them both in person and online. For a charming group of robot mimes who just wanted to entertain, and now get flak over anything from a gender change for a trans woman's comfort to a mustache intended as a joke, it's more than a little sad for longtime fans. Nothing like hearing a once-loving and optimistic band be entirely unsurprised at hearing about their fans sexually abusing each other. To quote Rabbit, "I lost faith long before you told me that."
</li><li> Mike Portnoy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a> wrote the song "Never Enough" from the 2004 album <em>Octavarium</em> in response to the more rabid parts of the fan base who kept criticizing and complaining and asking for more and more without realizing that the band's members are humans with lives. Other than that, even though the albums tend to divide the fan base, this hasn't had any real ill effects on their relationship with the fans, though one could assume the "demanding and never happy" type of fan isn't liked much by them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackDahliaMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackDahliaMurder">Trevor Strnad</a> posted a rant on Facebook around the release of <em>Everblack</em> that decried the illegal downloading of their albums, stating that the fans weren't sticking it to the man by downloading their music but were instead hurting them, as they were in that spot where they were big enough to live off of their music without having to consider day jobs but were nowhere near big enough to be anything even resembling rich and that they needed physical sales to prove that they were still relevant and retain strong label sales; if album sales fell below expectations, the likelihood that the label would start to consider them "old news" would rise significantly and could jeopardize their chances of continuing to receive support from the label. The responses were predictable; plenty of people (many of them musicians) agreed with both the statement and the sentiment behind it, while others took it upon themselves to shower them with abuse and accuse them of being whiny, entitled rockstars who saw the fans as piggy banks and were just getting mad that they weren't yielding enough.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Area11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Area11">Area 11</a>, while still fairly involved with their fandoms, used to be even more involved through the official Facebook fangroup, being members of it (for admin purposes) and joining in with the general fun, posting memes and so on. This changed when a fan somehow worked out the email address of Sparkles*, spammed him and then did something which resulted in the hashtag "Kill Colin" being spread <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6v86b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6v86b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6v86b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">fans in the group are not keen to elaborate on <em>what</em> precisely that was supposed to mean</span>. The band are no longer members of the group, but do still lurk there, so it's not as total a loss as it could have been.
</li><li> The primary reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeutralMilkHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeutralMilkHotel">Neutral Milk Hotel</a> stopped playing in the 1990s. Their fandom after <em>On Avery Island</em> grew rapidly, and given that their primary tour circuit was house shows and small venues, the band was often exposed to a lot of creepy art types that unnerved the members, especially frontman Jeff Mangum. This fanbase was so rabid that when the band toured for <em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em>, the entire audience was already singing along to the lyrics (keep in mind that this was in 1997 and the Internet was still very young, meaning there were few if any lyric databases), which greatly unsettled Mangum to the point that he quit playing after that tour. When Mangum finally returned to performing — first as a solo act in 2011 and 2012 and then with a reunited Neutral Milk Hotel from 2013 to 2015 — he hid himself behind a cap and giant beard, so that he couldn't <em>see</em> the audience at all. He seems to be fine with hearing an entire theater sing along with his lyrics nowadays, though.
</li><li> For a very long time, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> refused to play "Big Me" live, because whenever they did, they'd be pelted with Mentos, because its music video spoofed Mentos ads. They started playing it live again after their "Foozer" tour alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a> in 2005-06, as Weezer covered it with great acclaim.
</li><li> In 2018, a fanmade music video for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vaporwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vaporwave">Saint Pepsi</a>'s song "Enjoy Yourself" was taken down on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> for its use of footage from a commercial featuring Mac Tonight, due to said character being one of the symbols for the alt-right movement (like Pepe The Frog).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> has endured fans singing or clapping along, yelling requests and other nonsense for decades. But what really pisses him off is constant texting, tweeting, filming and talking, <a class="urllink" href="http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2018/07/neil-young-has-rough-night-in-detroit.html">especially during acoustic solo shows.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> He's also stopped playing certain songs because <a class="urllink" href="http://www.webcitation.org/76bJHhJJf">he can't make himself heard over the rude fans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> In the fall of 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeneathTheMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeneathTheMassacre">Beneath The Massacre</a> had their set cut short by the venue in what wound up being their last appearance in New York until 2020 due to many incidents of people crowd-killing, hate-moshing, and generally being inordinately violent in the pit towards non-participants. The band tried to get the venue to let them continue, but the venue declined, declared that the night was over, and told everyone who wasn't a member of the band to leave. Patrons who were there that night said that the crowd-killing was so out of control and people were getting so pissed off that the room felt like a powder keg, and it was likely a matter of minutes before the room erupted into an all-out brawl if the venue hadn't stepped in.
</li><li> Motley Crue frontman Vince Neil disabled comments on his Instagram in October 2018 due to constant harassment from trolls regarding his weight gain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX">Charli XCX</a>'s third studio album — years after her previous one, and coming off the hype of a series of EPs and mixtapes — was in production since 2015 and expected to be released sometime around 2018... and then in late 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak">her Google Drive was hacked, and over 200 files worth of demos and release-ready songs (as well as promotional artwork) came frolicking out into the internet</a>. While the leaks were widely loved by fans, Charli was devastated, and when combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">label interference as a result of it</a>, she decided to reboot the album into <em>Charli</em>, which would be released in 2019 containing all-new songs. Despite retaining pride in the leaked material, she's actively refused to release them legitimately as she considers them irreparably "tainted", with only a handful of songs managing to evade this principle.
</li><li> This trope sadly led to the breakup of LGBT electro-industrial duo Black Dresses. In spite of releasing four albums in their lifetime, their first one, <em>Wasteisolation</em> remained their most famous, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">experienced some retroactive buzz</a> via TikTok in 2020. However, this made the group uncomfortable, as that particular album focused on some heavily personal themes, such as childhood sexual abuse. As such, they weren't pleased when certain songs off the album, including "In My Mouth" (the album's most direct song about that topic), wound up becoming popular lipsync fodder among minors on the website in spring 2020; not only that, said minors began attacking and harassing co-founder Devi McCallion for the album's sexual lyrics and her making sexual posts on social media, even though the group had largely moved away from more personal topics at that point and Devi never catered her music towards that demographic. When Devi called out said people on social media for starting the trend and stated she didn't feel like going through her then-4,000 followers to block every minor, the harassment got <em>even worse</em>. In response, Devi deleted her profiles on social media and pulled the group's music from every platform except for Bandcamp; on May 27, the group officially announced their split, citing the above fiasco as a direct cause of it, and also stated that said harassment had actually been going on for <em>years</em> by that point. While the two still produce music together, it's highly unlikely they'll return to the Black Dresses name any time soon.

Other times, artists have to shut down their messages or commissions due to obsessive trolls and drama that breaks out whenever they open commission slots and are immediately filled by people who apparently wait <em>all day</em> for journals like that and then snipe the journal. Or, some people were just remarkably bad customers. Furries have been harassed at conventions and have said they would not be attending future events.

</li><li> Siddell also used to respond to reader's queries on a "Questions for Tom" thread on the <em>Gunnerkrigg Court</em> forum. He stopped, not so much because people asked the same questions, but rather because other readers would jump in and answer the questions themselves, making it a "Questions for Whoever Feels Like Answering" thread. He took his question-answering to a formspring account. However, when fans began repeatedly asking questions on topics he had stated he wasn't going to answer, and then getting combative over his not answering, Siddell deleted his formspring account. Fortunately, some months later, Siddell decided to give it another shot and reopened his formspring account.

Outside of the minotaur and the sphynx, there's nobody who'd count as "furry", and it seems like it's going to stay that way.
</li><li> <em>Moon Over June</em> is possibly an example of this, with Woc having disabled commenting on her newest strips. This change came quietly, but after a short story arc which was met with much criticism by the readers.

Despite this, he was content to leave the site running until it became a haven for an exceptionally rabid collective of trolls. When the trolls retaliated at Jones-Quartey's later input to the site, he took down the archive entirely. Thankfully, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.!

Then, despite—or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">because of</a>—his warnings not to imitate him or else he would delete the chatbox, a huge ginormous number of impostors went on all at once one day in May 2011.

At first, the chats and question sessions went well. However, after a large amount of "heckling" and being drowned out with constant clamoring requests of "Do you like this show? What do you think of this show? What's your opinion on anime?", etc. (Mostly done for the purpose of troll-baiting his opinionated statements against animated shows he doesn't like) and moderation not stepping in when people got out of hand, he dropped this method of communication altogether. He later created his own self-moderated blog to talk about various subjects (such as drawing or animated character theories), and he does participate in comment discussions there. However, he has made far fewer overt statements about cartoons he does not like, focusing more of his attention on simply praising the inspirations he does admire.

When he began work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, the blog was positively deluged by questions blatantly asking for spoilers from upcoming stories, questioners being incredibly rude or demanding, masking criticisms or flames as questions, duplicate questions, etc. This led to a temporary closing of the question form and new rules on what could be asked. Things calmed down, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">the March 2012 airing of episodes in Turkey before the U.S.</a> has led to an influx of questions basically asking for summaries of the dialogue in those episodes. In April 2012, Weisman openly stated he was <a class="urllink" href="http://s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=946">on the verge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of shutting the blog down completely. In July 2013, the website temporarily stopped accepting new questions until the following year.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDeLancie">John de Lancie</a> had to shut down production on bonus features for his Bronycon documentary due to rampant piracy.
</li><li> After the disaster that was <em>Las Pegasus Unicon</em>, which saw the convention run out of money to pay the guests followed by the "Las Pegassist" crowd-funding effort's check bouncing, both Tara Strong and Nicole Oliver opted out of attending conventions for at least a year. Voice actors now only try to attend the larger cons due to other commitments. In Strong's case, this sentiment has since changed. She has been seen at a couple smaller cons again possibly due to several fans openly offering to serve as protectors, but she works on a strict cash-only basis for autographs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic">My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic</a></em> was shut down because someone nominated it for a side-tournament at EVO, the biggest fighting game tournament in the world. Games for side tournaments at EVO are determined by a popularity poll, so people began to vote for <em>Fighting is Magic</em>. Both EVO staff and the game's developers asked the voters to stop nominating it; the EVO crew didn't want the devs to feel pressured to complete the game, while the devs urged fans to show support for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> instead. In spite of this, the fans kept voting for it. Unfortunately, this caught Hasbro's attention in a way that couldn't be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">openly</a> overlooked like with other fan projects. Hasbro had to respond with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">cease and desist</a> letter in order to protect their copyrights, and just like that, the entire project went up in smoke. It would eventually be resurrected and retooled as the original game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds">Them's Fightin' Herds</a></em> years later, but getting there required some very brazen moves on the fandom's part.
</li><li> The writers pretty much channeled all their years of bad experiences with obsessive fans into the episode "Fame and Misfortune" - where Twilight decides to publish the friendship journals and the ponies end up attacked by rabid fans. Notably the situation is not resolved by the end - with the cast stuck inside Twilight's castle as the angry mob complains from outside. However, MA Larson and several of the writers expressed that they did not find this a good idea and wanted to do something else, but were told to go forward by Hasbro anyway.

After it happened, director Big Jim Miller started receiving death threats from people who were mad about the leaks (which he had no control over), or who were mad about details that came from the episodes. This would lead to Miller putting his Twitter account on private, with several bronies starting the hashtag #ThankYouJim on Twitter in an effort to show that the rabid fans were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>'s critical reception eventually resulted in the fanbase attacking the creators and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a>. After a certain amount of time, Loeb or Marvel ended up taking down Loeb's Facebook page.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note100w40');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note100w40" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note100w40');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later on, there was speculation that wasn't really Loeb's Facebook page, just something a <em>Ultimate Spidey</em> hater made so other people could have a place to vent, and no one's entirely sure what the real story is.</span>
</li><li> For a short time at the beginning of Season 3, Frederator made weekly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> recaps called "Mathematical" for each episode that would also include themed caller segments. Then, the recap for the episode "What Was Missing" referenced the Marceline/Bubblegum pairing and asked for feedback, causing an explosion from some fans (from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">Shipping Wars</a>, to general homophobia, to shippers calling one of the show's writers a homophobe because he didn't like the recap, etc.), to the point where the Mathematical channel was deleted from YouTube, along with all the recaps, and Fred Seibert himself posted an apology for all the craziness. The controversy died down in later seasons, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">Word of Gay</a> finally confirmed that the duo at least used to be an item.
</li><li> With the revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a></em>, the crew created a Tumblr account to interact and answer fan questions. By April 2013, they disabled the Q&amp;A option due to endless nonsense and people asking the same questions over and over. They occasionally open it up again for Q&amp;A days.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode "Turban Cowboy" features one scene where Peter drunkenly runs over runners of the Boston Marathon, and another where Peter unknowingly sets off a bomb when he attempts to use a cell phone. The episode aired just a month before the April 2013 bombing at the real Boston Marathon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> responded by pulling the episode from everywhere it could legally be viewed from in the U.S.; a video remix, which made it look like Peter bombed the marathon, only made things worse. To put this in perspective, the show's notoriously irreverent creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>, was <em>utterly disgusted</em> by the video remix.
</li><li> Ciro Nieli, the man behind the 2012 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> reboot, signed up on a high-profile message board on the subject. After only a few posts, he announced that he was leaving and never coming back, due to being outright bullied over tiny perceived foibles over and over, including one user that posted many times, complaining about the same exact thing in each post leading to dozens of messages in-between his visits about the same thing, from the same person.
</li><li> Derrick J. Wyatt, for a time, stopped accepting questions about his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> or any questions on his take of his <em>Ben 10</em> universe, and closed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> account, due to a mix of redundant questions, angry hate mail from fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Alien Force</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ultimate Alien</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">and the stressful forced rushing of production towards the end of</a> <em>Omniverse</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">All of which made him swear off</a> <em>Ben 10</em> forever, to the point that he temporarily closed all questions, though were later reopened on his request that they have nothing to do with <em>Ben 10</em>. He also swore off the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> questions and said that he would never watch the show because he was <em>heavily</em> blamed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">having nothing to do with the writing or production of the show</a>. Eventually, Wyatt finally began answering questions about <em>Ben 10</em> again (if only because Duncan Rouleau of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios">Man of Action Studios</a> has a similar Q&amp;A blog), with the fandom being cautious not to aggravate him again, and due to the reboot now being the new focus of the fanbase, which caused the fans to be more forgiving and not as hateful towards <em>Omniverse</em> as before, Wyatt is more forgiving in return.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" received so many angry replies from fans incensed that it aired as an April Fools' joke instead of "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut", the episode that reveals the identity of Cartman's father, that Comedy Central <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">rarely reran it</a> until 2016.
</li><li> Due to the rowdy and often hostile behavior of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> fandom, this occurred somewhat frequently among the show's staff:
<ul><li> Though he would eventually bring it back, writer Matt Burnett deleted his Tumblr account after several fans heckled him regarding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> of Pearl's sudden dislike for human food.
</li><li> A parody account on Tumblr titled "didyouknowstevenuniverse" would troll fans by posting clickbait-esque facts about the show, such as saying Pearl and Lapis would be killed off. The blog runner shut down the account when some fans thought the "facts" were real and began harassing the show runners. The blog runner later reopened the account with a disclaimer ensuring that the posts were meant to be jokes.
</li><li> After the episode "Keystone Motel" aired, several fans found out there was an actual motel with the same name and began posting fake reviews based off events from the episode, such as saying there was no water in the pool in addition to scorch marks at the bottom. Unfortunately, Matt Burnett had to step in and tell fans to stop as these reviews risked giving the motel a bad reputation.
</li><li> Writer and storyboarder Jesse Zuke (formerly Lauren Zuke prior to coming out as non-binary) had to delete their Twitter account following an episode that showed two characters, Lapis and Peridot, living together. Fans said that Zuke was favoring a relationship between the two, as opposed to the Amethyst and Peridot pairing that was hinted at in a previous episode. Eventually, it escalated to fans accusing Zuke of "queer baiting", despite the fact that Zuke's bisexual and the relationship as it appeared in the show was between two female characters anyway. Zuke then deleted their Twitter account, saying, "I decided I don't want to be accessible to thousands of people who think because I work on a TV show that I owe them myself all the time." The entire incident also resulted in Peridot's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog">Twitter account</a> posting far less frequently, since Zuke was the one running it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: During a panel at the Gallery Nucleus, some of the show's staff aired a sneak peak of the new opening sequence for Season 3, and warned the audience they would likely never show sneak peeks again if any of them recorded it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak">leaked it to the Internet</a>. Much to their disappointment, someone did it anyway. However, sneak peeks of future episodes were still done at San Diego Comic-Con due to the show's status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">flagship series</a>.
