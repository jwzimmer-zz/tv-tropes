The reason can be perfectly solid, e.g. one of them is the other's boss, or one is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a> for the other, and making the relationship public would reveal too much, but just as often it can be an ill-defined "I'm not ready for them to know" excuse. They remain awkwardly but successfully concealed for several episodes, speaking in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemisms</a>, constantly leaving to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkAboutThatThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkAboutThatThing">Talk About That Thing</a> and generating many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot">"Fawlty Towers" Plot</a>  basically put, behaving in such a manner that requires all other characters to juggle the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> like crazy.
</p><p>Eventually they will be found out. This is not a variable  the Secret Relationship is made to be discovered.

The <em>original</em> ending planned (as mentioned in the mangaka's afterword in the last tankoubon) was that Miki and Yuu <em>were</em> half-brother and -sister and stopped dating, moving onto college. But the mangaka decided to change it when told by her editors that it was crazy.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em>, Makoto and Sekai both decide to date (and sleep with) each other, while Makoto is still in a relationship with Kotonoha, which he also never really breaks off and continues to lead her on. It gets worse from there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Much, much worse</a>.
</li><li> Played with left and right in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>. The Head of the Sohma family (and God of the Zodiac), Akito, is dangerously unstable and particularly susceptible to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> when it comes to the members of the Zodiac, so this seems to be the only kind of relationship they can have:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie">Hatori</a> and Kana. While their relationship may not have been intentionally kept a secret to people outside of the Sohma house, Kana and Hatori formally go to Akito to ask for a marriage blessing. Akito treats this knowledge as a secret that was kept from him (or better said her), and flips out accordingly by smashing a vase into Hatori's head, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">effectively blinding him in one eye</a> in the process. Kana's witnessing of this and Akito's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYousuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYousuckSpeech">accusation that this happened because of their relationship</a> breaks Kana to the point where Hatori had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">erase all her memories of their relationship</a> to save her from her depression.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Hiro</a> ends up telling Akito about his love for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kawaiiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kawaiiko">Kisa</a>... <em>before he even confesses his love to Kisa</em>. Suffice it to say that he ends up regretting it, and although he eventually gets over it, he doesn't actually confess his love to her for a long time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Haru</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Rin</a> play this trope straight, being in a relationship but not telling anyone about it. Naturally, this ends in tragedy when Akito <em>does</em> find out: Akito blames Rin for it, she takes the blame to protect Haru, and promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">throws her out a second-story window</a>, landing her in the hospital. It's clear that their choice to keep their relationship a secret is indicative of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">poor communication</a> in general, which causes still more trouble for them as time goes on.
</li></ul></li><li> While most of their friends, and their parents, are well-aware of their relationship, Nitori and Anna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> have this type of relationship. It mainly has to do with the fact Anna is a model (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">so her career would suffer</a>), and that Nitori is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a>.

It's later shown that they had been married as well.
</li><li> Mari and Akko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends">Girl Friends</a></em> keep their relationship from their friends, probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">they're both girls</a> and aren't sure how they would react. However, while Sugi-san had mostly figured it out even before Akko and Mari had (thanks to a rather transparent attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend">I Have This Friend...</a> by Akko), even in the epilogue set a year after they got together Tamamin still hasn't figured it out.

Cromwell's reaction is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>; then he fetches Helen Barre, a trustworthy woman serving in his household, to help Grete.

Cromwell is floored. Rafe is equally floored that he was even able to keep it a secret given that it was going on more or less under Cromwell's nose, and Cromwell is not usually the man to miss a trick.

Their close friendship (which has turned into a romantic and sexual relationship) is not really hidden at all, despite the conflict of interest that comes from the fact that they are the heads of the two branches of government in the Fleet (civilian and military).

Then Liara finds out if you were dating.
</li><li> Whenever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> enters a relationship in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> onward, it's heavily implied that they keep it a secret, likely to not interfere with their missions or cause any unusual rumors to spread. Some of the more justified examples include:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> If the Male Protagonist romances Mitsuru, she makes it clear in that she wants it to be secret, at least for a while, because during her Social Link, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto">ducks</a> from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> that was set up for the sake of her father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Portable</em>, this is naturally what the female main character and Ken do if they get into a relationship because they know what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">the normal reaction would be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">to a 16 and 10 year old couple</a>. Any suggestions of coming out get shot down by Ken himself. If the Female Protagonist romances Akihiko, a secret relationship is also implied if she speaks to certain characters - if she talks to Junpei on Christmas while she is Akihiko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, he puts two and two together and is genuinely surprised.

The only way to even partially expose a relationship Yu might have with a party member is by talking with the teammates at the entrances of the dungeons in the Midnight Channel. If Yu is played as a serial cheater, hints toward that get dropped as well, but it doesn't get blown out in the open until the Valentine's Day sequence in the <em>Golden</em> remake: he can only choose one girl, and then all the other gals that he romanced will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">sadly tell him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">how disappointed they are on him</a>.
</li><li> It's repeated again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>. There are some more justifications for the secret aspects, not just for Ren's party members, but for his Co-ops as well: Haru is like Mitsuru in that she also ducked out of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>, Futaba is his caretaker Soujiro's adopted daughter and he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">very protective of her</a>, and half of the romanceable Co-ops are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">older women</a> who all suggest him to lay low, especially if he romances <em>his homeroom teacher Sadayo</em>.

Jack is a professional hockey player in the NHL and there are currently no out queer players, so he doesn't know how public knowledge of his relationship with another man would affect his career. They eventually decide to tell their teammates and fully come out to pretty much the entire world when they share an impulsive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmoochOfVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmoochOfVictory">Smooch of Victory</a> after Jack's team wins the Stanley Cup.

Sarah decides to tell her mother early on but Janey can't get the nerve to tell her homophobic mother. They both end up coming out one way or another.

However, she wants to keep it secret from everyone and will deny their affair if Fry tries to reveal it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Morgan:</strong> Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it. <br/><strong>Fry:</strong> Just like very other girl I've dated.

Since that episode, there have been numerous episodes in the second season where they're still dating, yet Kendall either breaks-up with Ronaldo, prefers Kick and even cheats on him behind his back (<strong>literally</strong> behind his back).

Afterwards, they (literally) put their relationship back in the closet, with varied degrees of secrecy after that.

When Padmé's old flame, Rush Clovis, shows up and she starts getting close to him to get some information, this does not sit well with Anakin, who can't really say she's already married to him since he isn't supposed to be married in the first place. After he nearly beats Clovis to death in a fit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">jealous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">rage</a>, Padmé not only calls him out on him going too far with his possessiveness, but on how screwed up their relationship actually is. They aren't able to do the things that legit married couples get to do and there's some distrust between them. As a result, she decides that they should stop seeing each other for a while (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">which only lasts seemingly until the end of the next episode</a>).

And we do mean <em>only</em>: Ahsoka, Rex, Obi-Wan, Palpatine, Bail Organa and Yoda, not to mention R2-D2 and C-3PO, are all shown to either outright know about or suspect the existence of said relationship.

<ul><li> Romeo and Juliet could have learned a few valuable lessons from Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille, who determined to unite both themselves in marriage and their kingdoms into the unified Spain. This they accomplished in defiance of both their families and the Church's ban on marriage between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">second cousins (which is what they were)</a> besides through numerous secret letters sent to each other, a couple of clever ruses, Ferdinand disguising himself as a traveling merchant at one point, and a Papal Bull of dubious authenticity. In addition to their success in consummating their secret relationship, they also proved to be very cunning political partners. Seriously, their history sounds a lot like what Romeo and Juliet's tale might have been like if Niccolo Machiavelli had written it instead of Shakespeare. Today, <em>every</em> Royal House in Europe is descended from them—usually many times over.
</li><li> Australian astronomer Ruby Payne-Scott was forced to marry in secret because the law did not permit married women to hold a permanent position in the Commonwealth public service. She was eventually discovered and forced to leave her position, despite being a pioneer in the development of radiophysics and radio astronomy.
