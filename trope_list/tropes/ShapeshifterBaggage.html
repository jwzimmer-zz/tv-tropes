Usually, no attempt beyond maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a> is made to explain how the shapeshifter disposes of excess mass or acquires needed mass.

</p><p>Sometimes explained by increasing or decreasing the density of mass, making the shifter smaller or larger by changing the spacing of the particles/darkmatter/etc. that makes up their body. Sometimes it is done by consuming mass like food/drink/flesh/etc. then expelling it later to change size, shape, or mass. One particular way to achieve this is through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalAttributeSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalAttributeSwap">Physical Attribute Swap</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferredTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferredTransformation">Transferred Transformation</a>; after all, the process you use to take the alternate form from another person could just as easily be used to take extra mass from that person as well.

When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryo's "father" died after being possessed by a demon, Ryo moves the corpse and discovers the weight is double what it should be.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed">Scryed</a></em> is a good example of a justification of this trope, although transformation is only seen in one character and in a subset of the typical creation power. Whenever an Alter User summons their Alter, the mass they require for it is taken from surrounding objects or the environment itself. When protagonist Kazuma's Alter upgrades to the point where it's a true transformation rather than just a gauntlet, summoning it seems to involve breaking down his own regular arm to turn it into Shell Bullet, to say nothing of a few other uses of Alters that break down dead bodies, human or animal, for mass. Yikes. Taken up a further notch with another Alter User whose Alter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>. His first use of it, in response to a bunch of villagers backing him to the edge of a cliff, was to vaporize <em>them</em> as material.
</li><li> In Kenichi Sonoda's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion">Cannon God Exaxxion</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> sidekick can shapeshift into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBike">hoverbike</a>. She stores the excess mass needed to change in her breasts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted. Envy, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">their</a> lithe and feminine physique, is very heavy, and as a result, makes very deep footprints and can break a steel fence after a short fall, in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">not even budging</a> when Ed punches it in the face.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">The 2003 anime's</a> version of Envy, meanwhile, only ever takes human forms within a certain size range and seems to weigh as much as a normal human. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The exception is the huge dragon thing in the climax, a form it shifted into once it passed through the Gates and got stuck in.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the lesser known manga <em>Momoiro 1/10</em> — Momoiro is 50 feet tall and weighs several tons. When she's shrunken to the size of a normal human, she still weighs several tons and is denser than lead. Trying to walk across the top floor of her school causes the floor to collapse, running across a parking lot causes a trail of destroyed concrete, etc etc.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Ditto can change into 'mons of any size, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">anime</a> once subverted it with a Ditto that couldn't change size.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, the APTX-4869 toxin has a million-to-one chance will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">de-age</a> a victim back to when they're 8 years old. This is explained that it causes apoptosis to occur within non-neural cells, so that a large portion of tissue gets killed off and simply evaporates away. Shinichi described the sensation like his bones melting. However this doesn't explain how the re-aging antidote causes the mass to return.
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">Magic Pants</a>, this is the second most common source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> whenever Jusenkyō transformations are concerned: Mousse, Shampoo, and Ryōga all change into smaller animals with no explanation as to where their mass goes, or where it comes from when they change back. Genma and Pantyhose Tarō change into larger animals (in Tarō's case, a chimera that is <em>several</em> stories tall). On a lesser scale, Ranma, Herb, and Rouge also lose or gain mass drastically, even if they remain roughly human-shaped (in Rouge's case) or merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">change sex</a> (for Ranma and Herb). Might be justified in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationRay">Jusenkyō</a> curses its victims with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">magical transformations</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano">Saikano</a></em> uses this, but doesn't attempt to handwave it or anything of the sort.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Boomers</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> series present this problem. How can a man-sized android shaped like an ordinary salaryman sprout enough mass to turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">flailing tentacles</a>? At least in one case it was because it was an absorbing type Boomer that used nanotechnology to fuse machinery, and eventually even scenery to its mass.
</li><li> The Invaders in <em>Shin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo</a> Armageddon</em>. For example, in one episode, the main characters respond to a distress signal from the ruins of New York City. When they get to the origin of the signal, they find two puppies and a dead person at a radio station, but the puppies afterwards turn out to be a pair of <em>building-sized</em> Invaders from a larger group that set a trap.
</li><li> The Saiyan <em>Oozaru</em> form from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> is never fully explained; how does one quickly transform from a human-sized alien to a full-blown giant monkey? Of course, not much else makes "scientific" sense in that series. However, Oolong the pig's physical strength and body mass remain constant regardless of his current shape. Simply becoming a motorbike, for instance, doesn't guarantee he's strong enough for Bulma to ride.
<ul><li> Likewise, Namekians regrow limbs and occasionally grow to the size of buildings, among other powers that make the Saiyans look plausible in comparison (for instance, Namekians don't need food - even plants in real life need nutrients from other sources in addition to air and water).
</li></ul></li><li> Happens often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, as it seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">chakra</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoConservationOfEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoConservationOfEnergy">No Conservation of Energy</a>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orochimaru</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">true form</a> is revealed when he spits out a baseball-sized piece of something through his throat... which grows into a monster <em>several times the size of his body</em>.
</li><li> Kimimaro can grow bones from his body and use them as weapons, apparently just by controlling the hormones of his body. Putting aside that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">he apparently needs to be able to survive removing his own bones without bleeding to death</a> this would also require his body to have an infinite amount of calcium to make the bones out of.
<ul><li> The manga Kimimaro seems to have an accelerated healing factor which attempts to explain this, but really just invokes the "Biomass from thin air" part of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> While not exactly a shapeshifter himself, Shikamaru is able to change the shape of his shadow, and he is specifically limited by his shadow's current area.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em>, the final boss of the Osaka mission "Nurarihyon" could change shape and size from a little old man to a monster the size of a high rise building, and is capable of splitting to multiple variable life forms of himself and demonstrates different powers with every different forms he assumes. He could survive being squashed to a puddle of blood and reform to another different gigantic monster instantly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was eventually killed off by consecutive blasts that squashed him to a blood puddle (again) by the main team leader, taking the bridge along with him. </span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Titan Shifters are otherwise ordinary humans who</span> can generate an entire Titan body out of thin air. It's implied that this is only possible because Titan flesh is about as dense as smoke, held together by their consciousness or something; Titans are noted to weigh a great deal less than something their size should, and dead Titans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind">rapidly evaporate</a>.
<ul><li> Despite this, Titans still exhibit many attributes that match the mass one would expect from something their size; they can crush buildings and fortifications by falling on or striking them, can be heard coming with thundering footsteps (and can leave deep footprints), and can pick up and wield massive objects.

They also are shown to take at least some time to seal a hole that gets blown in their bodies: they can't just regenerate the lost mass, they have to rearrange their structure to plug the hole.

Hand-waved as involving a specialized organic material called RC cells, it isn't clear how someone can store that much excess biological material inside their body without extra weight or mass.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Hulk</a></em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk">The Ang Lee film</a> made some attempt to justify it, basing Bruce Banner's initial transformation on real animals that appear to "Hulk Out" (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">get bigger</a>) when they are scared or angry. Ok, cool. Then it turns out that the Hulk grows even bigger when he gets even angrier In that film, at least, the Hulk transformation is a <em>healing factor</em> based on real life animals that hulk-out (bullfrogs, for one). Using a combination of nanobots and energy from gamma radiation, a reaction kicks off that continuously repairs tissue in response to trauma. Most of the time, this causes the subject to explode, since the tissue creation never stops. However, Bruce Banner was experimented on as a child by his father for a project in adaptive genetics. As a result, Bruce could cope with the extreme healing factor and regulate it based off his mental trauma (as animals do) instead of physical. The transformation then buffs muscle and skeletal tissue in a non-dangerous way. Since he has frighteningly intense anger issues, he becomes the Hulk.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki's</a> article on the Hulk states that gamma rays, being the most powerful form of energy known, are so strong they can actually transform energy into physical mass, possibly explaining the increase in size. Now, as for where the mass goes when he transforms back, that's anyone's guess.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">A gamma ray burst?</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, a common explanation for size increase/decreases/etc is that characters' added/excess mass is "shunted off into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">pocket dimension.</a>"
<ul><li> Similarly, the censors are mollified by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySuitIsAlsoSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySuitIsAlsoSuper">uniforms</a> made of "unstable molecules" for most shapeshifters, either heroic or villainous. The example springing most easily to mind is Rahne "Wolfsbane" Sinclair, of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a> class, whose skintight school uniform shifts into a <em>collar</em> when she turns into her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">wolfoid</a> and wolf-forms. A collar that is so small that it doesn't even distort the fur around her neck, but is so comfortable that she has never, ever mentioned its existence. Rahne was frequently 'sartorially challenged' in the early comics she appeared in. Yet more than once changed from plain clothes to super uniform between panels.
</li><li> Averted in the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique">Mystique</a> reflects that she's good enough that she makes it looks easy — even though it's not. If she wants to grow in size significantly, she has to gain mass; if she wants to shrink significantly, she has to lose mass; and she always has to keep in mind the position of her organs. Based on the comics (unless this changed recently); unlike other shapeshifters, Mystique can't change mass and has to keep a generally human form. It's even suggested that she can remain in her Raven Darkholme form indefinitely because there's no change in mass, while trying to keep the same mass in a larger form is a strain that keeps her from using such forms for long. Given her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">age and experience</a>, however, that sort of 'strain' is a relative term. In her solo series of comics, she demonstrated an incredible creativity with the use of her powers despite the limits she had compared to most other shapeshifters. Among the feats she performs is flattening out to avoid taking damage by an explosion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">assuming a monstrous form</a> by <em>sprouting a second face and pair of arms</em> in order to quadruple wield (though she specifically mentions that doing so was <em>very</em> dangerous to her health, brain, and a massive strain to her powers), faking a glass vial being broken in her hand, faking the effects of a lethal virus, smuggling items in a "flesh pocket" in her stomach, and pointing out that since she mimics all her clothing too, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyNakedShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyNakedShapeshifter">technically naked</a> all the time.
</li></ul></li><li> Slightly (and disgustingly) avoided by Big Bertha of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreatLakesAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreatLakesAvengers">Great Lakes... um, at the moment, Initiative</a>. It's not explained where the extra mass comes from when going from supermodel Ashley Crawford into I-stop-traffic-the-hard-way Big Bertha. But after the heroics are done, she does have to expel the extra mass... by <em>vomiting</em> it back out. She doesn't like it any more than you do.
</li><li> The alien Skrulls are explicitly described as being unable to alter their mass, and therefore having size restrictions on what they can imitate. Some writers forget this, as when a Skrull character became a flea to hide on someone's person (or in their <em>very first appearance</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>, when a Skrull poses as Sue Storm and mimics her ability to turn invisible by shrinking), or gained tremendous weight to crush someone. This is "explained" by the existence of mutant Skrulls with the powers to do things like their human counterparts.
</li><li> Averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>. In an issue of his solo series, he reveals that he can borrow mass from the Earth. He also dodges it in that, since he can make any part of himself intangible and invisible, he can hide any excess mass he's not using.
</li><li> Micro-Might from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238">PS238</a></em> averts this trope. When using her powers, she gets smaller, but not lighter; she gets denser instead, apparently using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a> (although in a comic book physics way) to get stronger and tougher. Mass Master of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerPack">Power Pack</a></em> also had this property, and may have been the inspiration for Micro-Might.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>'s Doctor Connors regrows his arm whenever he becomes the Lizard. When this transformation happens gradually it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a>; growing it back was, after all, the point of his research. But then there's Komodo, whose improved version of the Connors' formula lets her shift between forms at will. In human form, she hasn't got any legs, and it becomes a bit harder to rationalize someone losing and growing back their legs as a result of falling asleep on a plane for a few minutes.
</li><li> Atom Smasher of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em> received his powers from his radiation-affected grandfather, but he uses a surprising mechanism for growth. His bones and muscles literally break and regrow as they stretch, pointing to some sort of accelerated biological growth process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Warlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Warlock">Warlock</a></em> seems to have no limit on how large he can transform (and change his mass to fit the size) instantly, but for some reason he doesn't really transform into anything smaller than he originally was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> is explained in greater depth down the page in Animation, but the comics have the same issues with Megatron transforming into a gun and Soundwave and Blaster as cassette players, all about big enough to fit in their hands in robot mode. A more noticeable example is Broadside, a triple-changer with alt-modes as both an aircraft and an aircraft carrier.
<ul><li> Explanations have been given for the particularly grievous examples like the above mentioned case of Broadside, wherein he is made up of a large number of armored plates that decompress and fold out to recreate the large mass of an aircraft carrier.

If this didn't happen, the shrunken or transformed kaiju would be so heavy they would fall through the floor.

Then the realism level crashes and burns when she goes into her cocoon and comes out a mature woman who has to weigh about twice as much as the little girl that went in. There's an attempt to justify it by explaining her food consumption as "storing up calories for some big event" except if that was true she should have been visibly bloated from holding her own weight in food in her stomach, and she wasn't (at most, child Sil is slightly chubbier before the cocoon). The whole cocoon process was probably mostly just made up so Sil could go straight from asexual child to mature sexpot without a logical but family-unfriendly intermediate stage.

And where does it go? In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk">Hulk</a></em> movie (not the one with Norton), every time Banner is seen returning to human form, we see steam emanating from him and water dripping from every pore of his body, slicking his hair to his head and soaking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">Magic Pants</a> to him. The suggestion seems to be that the excess mass is created by rapid cell division and when he calms down, the cells are turned into steam/water and are shed thusly. It wouldn't be the strangest thing to happen in a Marvel movie, but cell division does not actually <em>create</em> mass. <br/><br/>The Hulk's greater size, when compared to Bruce Banner, <em>might</em> be explained by him simply inflating himself like a pufferfish — i.e. he gets bigger, not heavier — except that when he's shown strapped to a table and deliberately induced to transform, the support strut for the table <em>buckles under his extra weight</em>. <br/><br/>Incorporating nitrogen and oxygen from the air could add about a kg per cubic meter absorbed. Admittedly that would create a pretty intense draft toward the guy while he's growing and some really unfeasible chemistry, plus when shrinking back down he'd emit some pretty toxic fumes (nitrates and peroxides— not friendly) but given that he's literally part starfish in the Ang Lee movie, upgrading his biology to starfish <em>alien</em> makes a certain amount of sense on a casual viewing, at least.

<ul><li> Originally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, the size/mass changing was essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> by explaining that a character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">DNA is "rebooted"</a> every time they transform. But in a later book, Ax explains that morpher's extra mass is stored in a pocket universe when s/he is in a smaller form, or taken from there when in a larger form... which also happens to be the hyperspace bypass that starships use. He even points out that the extra mass has to go <em>somewhere</em>. There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Million-to-One Chance</a> of having one's stored extra body mass run over by a random spaceship. Needless to say, the Animorphs are less than thrilled with this info. This actually happens in one book, whereupon the main characters (who were mosquitoes at the time) connected to that mass are "slingshotted" onto the ship... and take several minutes to put themselves back into one piece. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">disgusting results for the onlookers</a>. (The Animorphs aren't too interested in hearing about how they rewrote the Andalite science textbooks.) But though we learned where the extra mass goes with <em>smaller</em> morphs, just where the extra tonnage comes from when you go from teen to T-Rex remains a mystery.
<ul><li> Played straight, however, with the Helmacron "shrink ray". Animorphs and Yeerks are shrunken and unshrunken with impunity, without even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> as explanation.
<ul><li> The Shrink ray technology came from manipulating the morphing cube that gave the kids their powers. So presumably the Helmacrons used the same pocket dimension mass swapping technology just for a permanent shrinking effect instead of a temporary morphing one.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Brandon Mull's series "Beyonders", there is a shapeshifter with a limited amount of mass. To kill it, one must cut pieces off until it becomes small enough to be ignored. The shapeshifter mentions it uses copious amounts of internal body armor if it needs to disguise its mass.

</li><li> In Vicki Ann Heydron's short story "Cat Tale", a woman's idle wish to know what it's like to be a cat is granted; while she was thinking of a housecat, she's amused to realize that conservation of mass has made her a mountain cat.

</li><li> This is averted in some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books. In one book, a character who has been transformed into a toad wonders, "what happened to the rest of me?" In the very next book, we learn exactly what happens and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">it ain't pretty</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If a witch turns someone into a frog, they actually turn them into a frog and a large amorphous free-floating blob of chemicals.</span> In other books this doesn't happen, though. Essentially the Shapeshifter Baggage question raises a conflict between two fundamental Discworld laws: the Law of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality">Narrative Causality</a> (which says it should work like it does in stories) and the Law of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Conservation of Reality</a> (which says it can't be that simple). It's also possible that it depends on <em>how</em> the shapeshifting occurs; "natural" shapeshifting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a> via mental tricks and morphic fields have "neater" results than using magic to directly warp someone's shape. The clearest visible difference, though, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVsDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVsDoylist">Doylist</a> explanation implied by the fact that Shapeshifter Baggage only appears in the later books. The simple Watsonian one is that the witch who had to deal with the baggage had a lot of raw power but no relevant training, while the cleaner ones are done by some of the most powerful wizards in the world or by the use of Fairy Godmother wands (which are mysterious artifacts that bypass or ignore all the usual magic rules).
<ul><li> Like most things in Discworld, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> takes precedence, followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Greebo the cat is a large cat, as cats go, but his human version is specifically described as being six feet tall and muscular, because the plot clearly requires it.

And because the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> universe understands what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> means, male vampires can shapeshift with their clothing, while female vampires can't.
</li><li> It isn't stated that Angua is a similar mass in either form but the differential isn't huge — about 25% — so a short human woman would weigh about 50kg and a male wolf up to 45kg.

Conservation of mass isn't a problem at all for magical shapeshifting thanks to ectoplasm. When a creature shapeshifts, or when something from the Nevernever (faerieland) comes to the real world, the matter (in the case of a shapeshifter, the extra mass layered over their real body; in case of a demon, their whole physical body in the real world) is formed out of ectoplasm from another dimension, animated and given substance by magic. When that magic is withdrawn, the ectoplasm turns into an equal mass of a inert, clear, viscous goop which is an inconvenient mess but quickly evaporates. Arguably justified, in that there's an explanation of and consistent rules for where extra mass comes from that make as much sense as anything else in the series: leftover ectoplasm has been used to identify a crime scene as magical in nature, and I'm sure that characters have slipped and fallen on the stuff at some point or other.
<ul><li> This doesn't seem to explain how shapeshifting into something smaller works, though. Where does the extra mass go? The Nevernever? If so, how is it protected from some nasty spider-goblin thing that probably wants to eat it?
<ul><li> According to the official RPG, that's exactly what happens. It's presumably sent to something like a Demesne: a small pocket of the Nevernever under the way of a specific being, which is generally hard to reach unintentionally, as well as uninhabited by anything else. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">margin notes from Harry and friends</a> specifically mention this as a good adventure hook.

A dragon in human form, when viewed in the magical spectrum, can be seen as a human surrounded by a dragony "shadow". This shunting also takes a certain level of skill on the dragon's part.

Normally, however, this isn't a problem for them, as they have to digest their target to produce an exact imitation, which, by definition, gives them enough mass to transform.

Young Shi'ido can only change skin color, older ones could change into any humanoid species they wanted, and ones even older can change into whatever. However, if they tried to change beyond their natural boundaries, they'd be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock">stuck in that form for weeks or months</a>. How exactly they could change isn't well explained, but <em>The Essential Guide to Alien Species</em> said something to the effect that they have folds of extra skin under their skin that they can use if they need to to change into larger or smaller species (or rocks and trees, apparently). Also, since some species identify others with smell as well as sight, and the Shi'ido aren't perfect at what they do, it's explained that they use telepathy to get around (what could be described as) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a>.
</li><li> <em>Galaxy of Fear</em> has Hoole ignore conservation of mass whenever he needs to. If he's escaping with the child protagonists on a skimboard that won't take his extra weight, he can just turn into a small rodent that doesn't burden the craft. He once becomes a mammoth frog to carry them one at a time over a wall, and he can be a small flying animal to cover ground quickly. The times when he <em>can't</em> turn into something that gets him out of whatever situations he's in, so that it's the ingenuity of the kids that saves the day, sometimes seem arbitrary.
</li><li> Clawdites, the species of the female bounty hunter in <em>Attack of the Clones</em>. For them to transform it requires great concentration, which was broken slightly during the speeder chase with Anakin, and they are incapable of changing mass significantly. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRoleplayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRoleplayingGame">RPG expansion</a> that introduces Clawdites as a playable race notes that their shapeshifting ability is fluid-based, and that some individuals use a specially-built saline pump on their person to increase or decrease their mass. Even then, however, growing or shrinking beyond the size of an average humanoid is out of the question.

His solution is to use ultra-dense muscles so that he can weigh over three hundred pounds while still looking like an unremarkable 18-year-old. For a while, his obsession with stockpiling energy gets so bad that it actually starts to slow him down.
</li><li> The <em>Timeweb</em> trilogy by Brian Herbert takes the more obvious approach: shapeshifters grow larger by absorbing rocks and dirt into their own mass. Growing smaller is somewhat like shedding snakeskin, and can be a bit disgusting if a massive change is needed.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VoidCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VoidCity">Void City</a></em>, vampires have the power to shapeshift into one or more animals, but how it works varies between individuals. Some are able to take their clothes with them, while others have to leave their clothes behind. Eric actually generates new clothing: even if he starts out naked, he'll be in his usual casual clothes when he changes back. As a result, he's accumulated tons of identical outfits. Everyone just accepts it as a natural part and parcel of a vampire's magic powers.

This results in such things as a 3 foot tall T-Rex.
<ul><li> Played straight with another character who's body stored everything he ate (he never had to go to the bathroom) and kept absorbing until he had enough mass and excess food to go into a prolonged hibernation, during which his body would radically change (as would his powers).
</li><li> Skewed with Rahda "Elephant Girl" O'Reilly, who is a Irish-Hindu were-elephant. Her excuse is that she absorbs energy from the environment and converts it into mass; this can black out a city if used in the right location. Likewise, when she changes back the excess mass converts into a flash of light. Of course, the amount of energy needed to convert into a couple of tons of elephant flesh is incredibly titanic; and the energy release from changing back should wipe out a continent. So it's neither averted nor played straight.

We never see the shapeshifter's real form, but it appears he doesn't have shapeshifter baggage, has to study the person extensively, and holding the transformations appear to be <em>extremely painful</em>.

However, despite the radical change in size, it's stated that he hasn't actually gained any mass and thus his body is highly unstable.
</li><li> The Zygons are able to shapeshift into, pretty much, anything and anyone. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>, the Tenth Doctor suspects that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Queen Elizabeth</a> is one, despite the fact that they look fairly large. A few scenes later, one <em>does</em> turn into a copy of the Queen. The Doctor even suspects a harmless bunny of being a Zygon. The real Queen later kills the Zygon!Queen with a small dagger, pointing out that, at the time, the creature was as much a frail woman as her. The clothing bit is mentioned too by a different character.
</li><li> The Doctor states in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline">"Flatline"</a> that, if the TARDIS lands with its full mass projected in 3 dimensions, the Earth will shatter. In the same episode, something starts draining the TARDIS's dimensional energy, having it shrink into a small box several inches high. It also gets light enough that Clara is able to pick it up and carry it in her handbag. From the Doctor's point of view, the entrance out of the TARDIS has shrunk. Handwaved by the TARDIS being an extra-dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that regularly ignores the laws of physics.
</li></ul></li><li> At first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> kept it fairly reasonable. The series' first "shapeshifter" was really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Master of Illusion</a>. In the fourth volume they introduce a genuine shapeshifter, whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">power thief</a> Sylar promptly snacks on. At first, Sylar only used his shapeshifting power to shapeshift into people of roughly the same size and weight as him (and also still wore the same clothes before and after shifting). However, after a few episodes, Sylar is able to shapeshift <em>his clothes</em>, and also turns into a kid.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/H2OJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/H2OJustAddWater">H₂O: Just Add Water</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MakoMermaidsAnH2OAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MakoMermaidsAnH2OAdventure">Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure</a></em>, mermaids and mermen have tails noticeably bigger than the legs they replace. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doylist">Doylist</a> reason for this being the actors of the show are putting the tails on over their legs.

Apparently he can be heavier than an average human and still manage to turn into a bird and fly around (remember, "heavier than he looks"), or be carried around by Rom easily while in the shape of a glass.
<ul><li> In a later episode there is an attempt to avert this by having Odo leave some mass behind in a puddle on the Promenade when transforming into a bird. This... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">only creates new problems.</a>
</li><li> A book of the series actually features Odo lamenting this when he's in the form of a rat to squeeze through some ventilation ducts. He points out that, due to conservation of mass, he can't move as fast as real rat and if he's not careful will actually be heard crawling through the vents.

<ul><li> Shapeshifters can change into large animals, like horses, to tiny insects, like common flies. There's no explanation whatsoever how a shifter's mass changes.

Shapeshifting normally lets you gain or lose mass however you wish but the Mass Conservation limitation stops this and goes a bit further noting that 150lb mice and elephants shouldn't be allowed.
</li><li> White Wolf's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Werewolf: The Forsaken</a></em> takes time out in a supplement to explain the deep mechanics of Uratha (werewolf) biology. Among the various points is the fact that Werewolves don't actually shift shapes... they swap shapes. Uratha meta-biology has all five of a Werewolf's forms existent at all times; one in the physical world, and four stored as spiritual energy templates in the Werewolf's aura. As a result, beings that can see Auras perceive Werewolf auras as being intensely bright and dense, with the light brightening or dimming based on the size of the physical form. That means the aura is brightest in Urhan (normal wolf) form, and dimmest in Gauru (Man Wolf Death machine).
<ul><li> Although, if you're paying attention to the aura while in the presence of an eight foot tall enraged evolutionary monstrosity honed for violence... one might question your priorities.
</li><li> Entertainingly, this has actual mechanical effects on other aspects of the game. Since Vampires effectively eat souls and Magi can turn them into distilled energy for spells, Werewolf blood and flesh is an extra-potent tool for both creatures and one of the primary reasons your wolf-man sometimes ends up on the wrong end of the predator/prey relationship.
</li><li> The Cheiron Group from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Hunter: The Vigil</a></em> has a "regenerative nodule" implant that can allow someone to temporarily gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">regenerative abilities</a> like those of a Werewolf. However, there's a catch: while Werewolves can regenerate biomass from "elsewhere," a human with a regenerative nodule has to fuel the regeneration with his own body. As a result, when using the implant to heal wounds, the human has to constantly consume large amounts of food or risk starving to death.

</li><li> Averted and played straight with daemons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. In one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> novels, a ship servitor is possessed and becomes rapidly larger and gains a healing factor that renders it all but immune to damage. The aversion, however, is that Cain notes that it's actually <em>pulling up parts of the deck</em> as it walks: it's a techno-organic abomination to begin with, so it's just absorbing the bridge of the ship (and the crew) to add mass. Played straight in most other cases of possession: the host generally explodes into a pulsating mass of organs, then starts rapidly gaining mass from nowhere. Possibly justified by the nature of the Warp and daemons in general, as daemons <em>can</em> manifest without hosts (or with dead ones), but they tend to be much, much less stable than ones with a body to start building off.
<ul><li> And if worst comes to worst, they can just Handwave it by saying the daemons are borrowing mass from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a>.

</li><li> X-Parasites also tend to do this while mimicking creatures. Most creatures of roughly human to twice human size will require just one X, despite the X only being about the size of a basketball. Some other creatures, like certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>, will require two or more (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Golden Pirates</a> have <em>five</em> for some reason) and bosses will generally have a larger Core-X surrounded by smaller X, showing at least a semblance of realism.
</li><li> Where exactly does Samus stuff her body when she goes Morph Ball? This is at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, where one of the scans in the Phazon Mines reveals that the pirates attempted to copy morph ball technology, but... well, the results weren't pretty. If you peek in between the two halves of the Morph Ball in the <em>Prime</em> series it appears to be a case of Samus being converted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">Pure Energy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> averts this rather well. Size-wise all the people Mercer absorbs are about the same size as him. It's also strongly implied (though never stated) that Mercer weighs significantly more than a normal person does. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundShatteringLanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundShatteringLanding">Falling more than a few feet causes the pavement to buckle underneath him when he lands</a> - falling great distances sends out a massive shockwave that can throw cars aside and kill bystanders!, which gives him plenty of mass for his larger powers (such as his Whipfist or Shield) or denser powers (Hammerfists, as in the page quote, and Armor).
<ul><li> Also, whenever Alex uses his non-shapeshifting powers (like super-strength or clinging to walls), there's an effect that seems to imply mass is being expended. We see a similar effect when he's gliding. This seems to imply that he's "burning" the extra mass, keeping himself from getting too heavy.
</li><li> Try standing on a vehicle - most cars and other vehicles will be unable to move, and even <em>tanks</em> are slowed down by his weight. Using thermal vision, Alex is also far, far warmer than other humanoid entities (such as civilians, soldiers, etc.). Whether this is to make him easier to see and control for the player or yet more suggestion that he has much more mass is unknown. In thermal vision, Infected also appear brighter than normal civilians and even soldiers, which could imply that, like Alex, they are far denser than ordinary people.
</li><li> One has to wonder that if Alex has all that mass to create craters from very high falls and elbow drop with a heavy hammerfist to shatter armor among other things, how is it that he can flip (by tapping the jump button) onto a normal car (from the same level) and walk onto its roof and not have it crushed under what is supposed to be exceedingly heavy weight over a small area (a pair of feet)? After all, to throw an army truck without shoving himself in the opposite direction, he needs to possess a comparable amount of inertia himself, hence a cab-crushing amount of mass.
<ul><li> Unless of course he uses biomass to "adhesively" secure himself to the ground before throwing stuff that should still weigh a lot more than him. Doesn't really explain air-throws though.
</li></ul></li><li> As long as he takes off his shield and armor, he can sprint as fast as a car and still trivially knock people down non-lethally... anyone?
<ul><li> Perhaps his armored shell prevents him from properly flexing and articulating his limbs as quickly as he can normally.
</li><li> Even better: Ever tried shoving someone right next to a deformable object/terrain? What should been a shove that pushes someone moderately, if you miss, can dent cargo containers, vehicles, even a military base exterior fortification wall!

The tell? They're <em>extremely dense</em> as a side effect of having enough mass to shift to larger forms — the protagonist first discovers them with the aid of glasses that can analyze molecular structure and determine an object's density at a distance... and suddenly discovers people that have a far higher density than seems to make sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheThing2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheThing2002">The Thing (2002)</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whitley</span> goes from an ordinary Man-Thing to a ten story high monster when he finally transforms for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> regeneration is handled realistically - while under any sort of rapid regeneration effect (either granted magically or naturally), your hunger meter will drain 50% faster than normal. Polymorphing however, is not - you can polymorph into anything from a tiny bat to a gigantic dragon with no explanation for where the extra mass comes from/goes. Some monsters will do this regularly, such as wererats which rapidly shift between human and rat forms, or chameleons, whose natural form is the same size as a real life chameleon but who can change into any other creature in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>'s druids can shapeshift into a cat, a deer, a bear, a bird, a seal, an owlbear, and a treant. No mention is ever made of how this is actually possible. It's not that they make their mass less dense, since the bird can actually fly and the deer can carry a rider. How it is physically possible for a 9 foot Tauren to become a cat boggles the mind... much less how a warmblooded mammal becomes a treant. Especially since shapeshifting doesn't even cost mana. The game's magic usually makes some degree of sense, even if it violates the real world's laws of physics (often it-at least canonically-obeys the law of conservation of energy, for example). This though, makes no sense at all.
<ul><li>There is also the polymorph spell, which can temporarily turn anyone into a sheep (or pig, or frog). Player characters range in size between 4ft and 9ft, and polymorph can also be used on a warlock's demon pets (who can but up to 12ft in height). Again, no explanation is offered for how this works.
</li><li> There are also the dragons, who can take the forms of humanoids as they wish. Dragons are enormous creatures, but they start out tiny. Tiny whelps can take the shape of a human child, and collossal adults can take the form of a human. There's a 2ft difference between a human child and a human adult, while there's a 6ft difference between a whelp and an adult. How this works is anybody's guess. It's not an illusion, since a dragon who encounters itself via time travel shenanigans can't shapeshift.

<ul><li> Jake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> is an extreme example, being able to stretch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever</a>-scale on demand. One episode, "The Limit", explored what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">limit</a> there is to Jake's shapeshifting, and he didn't reach it until he had stretched a <em>great</em> distance. But that was due to his organs no longer functioning, so the hypothetical limit of how massive he can become hasn't been explored yet.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a> isn't even a shapeshifter, but they can still stretch over miles and miles with no loss of volume when, normally, their body is just a few feet long.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> episode "Dale Beside Himself" features the Fleeblebroxians, a roughly mouse-sized alien race that can transform into anything with ease, for example a dragon the size of a small dog and several hundred times the mass of a chipmunk. This can hardly be explained by the fact that they consist of "unstable molecules".
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, every fairy suffers from this. Let's just say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>" and move on. As these are the same fairies that regularly POOF! things into existence the baggage is one of the least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> things about them.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, sequences in which gargoyles awaken from "stone sleep" often show fragments of stone scattering from their skin as they re-animate, as if they're breaking out of a very thin coating of rock. Although there's plenty of magic in their Verse, "stone sleep" is described as a natural physiological quirk of their species, so losing an outer crust of stone every sunset ought to cost them whatever energy they'd allegedly accumulated from sunlight while immobile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwaved</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> with nanobots. Not always a perfect solution there, though: nanites build stuff <em>out of other stuff,</em> so constantly generating his weaponry and vehicles, and doing it <em>again</em> when they get broken, means a lot of metal is being made from no apparent source; <em>much</em> more of it than Rex's body and nanites could possibly provide the material for. The plot of one of the episodes deals with another type of shapeshifter baggage: where do all the nanites Rex absorbs <em>go</em>? It turns out that every now and then Rex has to go to a base in the Antarctic with giant, massive vats he has them drained into, otherwise the sheer quantity may make him go crazy.
</li><li> Nobody's really sure where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> gets her extra mass when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">transforms</a>. Interestingly, Mr. Cat, the other shapeshifter in the cast, doesn't appear to experience significant changes in mass despite his wide variety of forms.
</li><li> Imp from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a></em> routinely took on forms that required an outside energy source to perform their function (and more energy than he could reasonably produce naturally) and he was never shown having to recoup what was lost. Notable examples are being a lit candle, two types of rocket complete with jet propulsion, flame thrower powerful enough to start a forest fire, and a laser rifle.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. Sandman loses some of his sand every time he fights, and has to be 'fed' raw silicate to keep the same mass. He only becomes bigger when he ingests <em>more</em> silicate, and becomes a giant after taking an entire beach's sand.
</li><li> <em>Challenge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> never explained where Apache Chief got the mass to grow 50 feet tall whenever he said "Inekchok!". People speculated that 500 cattle disappeared from the Great Plains whenever he did this. Clearly, this is ridiculous — everyone knows that a Native American would absorb 500 <em>buffalo</em>, not 500 cattle!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> Beast Boy has been everything from an amoeba to a Diplodocus, yet his base form couldn't weigh much more than 100 pounds. The same likely applies to his comic form. Beast Boy often uses this trope to his advantage. A typical move for him is getting up high with a small bird morph, then becoming an elephant or dinosaur to smash whatever's below him. Then there's his "patented wet-willy manouver", that is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he turned in a small bird, flew inside the ear of the gigantic Trigon and then turned into a <em>whale</em></span>...
</li><li> He uses similar physics-defying tactics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> where he'll transform into a fast running or high jumping quick animal like a cheetah or monkey, get some serious speed or height, and then transform into a rhino or elephant to slam into them with all that extra weight moving at that momentum.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJusticeRevivalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJusticeRevivalSeries">Young Justice Season 3</a></em> episode "Nightmare Monkeys", this is brought up by the Monkey God when he reveals the he had chosen Gar to receive his powers.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"Why do you think you can only change into animals? And do the words 'conservation of mass' mean anything to you at all?"</em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, extra mass is stored in pocket universes. Oddly enough, the parts of someone's alternate mode that don't really have anything to do in robot mode don't go away, and instead tend to form decorative "kibble". This technique is used mainly for changing size and storing weapons.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">2007 movie</a> specifically averted this by having the CGI computers track where every nut and bolt went during transformation. The result was that some robot forms were twice as tall as others. (The Allspark was the main exception; presumably being the Macguffin gives you the right.)
</li><li> The original cartoon did not explain where, for example, Optimus Prime's trailer went when he transformed from truck mode - it's just shown going out of shot or into the frame as required. (The trailer is supposed to turn into a battle platform, but frequently this was either ignored or forgotten.) This has become a long-running joke in the fandom, and even appeared in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> short, where a kid asks Optimus where his trailer goes. As it turns out, Optimus doesn't know himself.
</li><li> There was, in fact, one episode of the G1 cartoon where, as Optimus transformed and his trailer started to move offscreen, it actually glowed briefly, then vanishes. Which becomes funny as in one incarnation, the trailer served as a holder (or whatever) for a pair of secondary robots. In the film series, it actually holds Optimus' spare guns. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Lots and lots of spare guns</a>.
</li><li> In the IDW comics (the "-ation" miniseries at least) mass shifting, as befitting dimensional rupturing, required a <em>lot</em> of energy to do and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">generated quite spectacular fireworks</a> due to laws of physics being broken. The headache was simultaneously decreased <em>and</em> increased by only having one character consistently mass-shift, but of course it was <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Size_changing">Megatron turning into a gun.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> can shapeshift into just about anything with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> bodies, but as Amethyst tells Steven when he tries to make himself taller, they can't keep their forms for too long or it'll make them worn out. As Steven is half-human, this ends up turning him into a baby until the following morning.
<ul><li> In a later episode, when Amethyst has to impersonate Jasper, she soon starts sweating from having to hold a larger form for so long, and changes back as soon as the Rubies who were looking for Jasper aren't looking at her.
</li><li> Out of all the known Gems in the show, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pink Diamond</span> is the only one shown to easily shapeshift into a form much smaller than her without any complications, more specifically as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rose Quartz</span>. Possibly justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was taller but significantly thinner as Pink Diamond, and so her mass as the shorter, fatter Rose was most likely similar - or maybe it's just Diamond mojo</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, changelings, or at least Pharynx and Ocellus, can apparently transform into things much larger and heavier than themselves, with all the mass that the larger creatures would have. No explanation is given for the added mass.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts">Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</a></em>, where Kipo hysterically rants about her newly discovered half-Mute abilities. And this is <em>before</em> she discovers she can perform even more drastic limb shifting, such as turning her arm into a giant leopard leg:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kipo</strong>: I mean, my dad told me about "body changes", but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower">nothing like this</a>. I have fur that grows out of my arm, then goes away! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">WHERE DOES IT GO</a>?

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Plants gain mass via photosynthesis, which basically involves using sunlight to power a chemical conversion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into various carbohydrates and oxygen as a waste product. It could be concluded that the atmosphere itself is a plant's shapeshifter baggage, containing the majority of the biomass the plant will use to grow, be it a blade of grass or a 100-foot-tall redwood tree. (At least, combined with minerals dissolved in moisture in the soil and absorbed through the roots.)
<ul><li> Interestingly, this is true in reverse for animal life. One would think that someone who undergoes significant weight loss would have excreted most of that weight via the usual "waste disposal" methods, but it is actually mostly expelled via breathing - the CO2 expelled is denser than the O2 inhaled and over time this adds up to a lot more than urination/defecation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Einstein's</a> famous formula E = m * c^2 basically states that mass is a form of energy. (Granted, that's putting it rather simply, but still.) As energy can change form, it is perfectly possible to convert energy into mass or vice versa. Slam an electron and a positron<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p8e3');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0p8e3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p8e3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The antimatter equivalent of an electron</span> together at sufficient speeds (that is, with enough kinetic energy), and you may well get a muon and antimuon, each of which is <em>200 times</em> as heavy as an electron.
