She doesn't know that Gendo abandoned Shinji shortly after his mother died, and had every right to be pissed off at Gendo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yuuri's initial reaction to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shattering Victor's heart</span> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">completely apathetic</a>, reaching out to casually touch him while making an utterly inappropriate remark. He then proceeds to act confused and defensive when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Victor</span> snaps at him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also comments that he can be "quite cold-hearted", and is "someone who doesn't really try to get into people's hearts".
</li><li> Victor's lack of experience as a coach causes him to be this, which results in him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> making Yuri cry by telling him that he'll resign being his coach if he doesn't place on the podium, which he only said to scare Yuri out of his anxiety</span>. And, in Episode 11, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yurio subtly mocks Yuri's performance by saying that Otabek will score higher than him, Victor doesn't defend Yuri or even give him some reassurance and simply expresses awe at Otabek's performance, which hurts Yuri even further. In fact, he says nothing to comfort Yuri even after seeing how he's upset with the results of his short program, though it's likely he's unaware that Yuri's mood is getting worse</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ayu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> can have shades of this. She calls people "resistant as cockroaches", but means it in the nicest way of a compliment. She decides on a group-split-up that leaves her with someone that she is implied to have a crush on and doesn't get it why people react strangely about it. It isn't until Tsunomata points out to her that her straightforward ways can be seen as hurtful that Ayu even wonders <em>why</em> it would seem hurtful.
</li><li> This is what kicks off the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnthemOfTheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnthemOfTheHeart">The Anthem of the Heart</a></em>: as a child, Jun Naruse witnesses her father leave a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHotels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHotels">gaudy building made to look like a fairytale castle</a> accompanied by a woman she's never seen before, and immediately comes to the conclusion that he's secretly a prince- and promptly goes to tell her mother. As Jun gushes about her father and "his princess", her mother's back is to the camera, but her reaction is more than clear to the viewer.
</li><li> Suzu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime">Akagami no Shirayukihime</a></em> manages to combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>. It is incredibly difficult to tell when he's actually snarking but his questioning if he's going to be arrested when he learns that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">Lowen</a>" is actually the crown prince means he's not as innocent or oblivious to how out of line he tends to be as he tries to appear.
</li><li> Laios of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> can be this sometimes. His love for everything monster related leads him to do and say questionable things. In one chapter where everyone is stripping down out of their wet clothing, he wants <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to see a naked Itsuzumi. Not for any sexual reasons, but to see how her fusion with an animal soul has affected her body. He is still forced to wear a blindfold by the others for the rest of the chapter.</span>
</li><li> When Loki Asgard transfers into the main characters' class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl">Boku Girl</a></em>, her first act upon seeing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">androgynous Mizuki</a> is to remark on how girls are allowed to wear the boys uniform. This is actually a subversion in that Loki Asgard is <em>the</em> Loki and is directly responsible for Mizuki being turned into a physical girl, so she knows <em>exactly</em> what she's saying.
</li><li> Touma Kamijou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> says it's ridiculous that so many people think he's attracted to girls like Index or Mikoto because they're just kids (he's 17, they're 14).

He had no idea why she was crying, or that he'd been ignoring her at all.

During his adventure to find the Dragon Balls, he gets into the habit of patting a person's crotch when he meets them to find out their gender.

Probably the best example of this is when Seo tells Nozaki that people ask her for help all the time, that she's considerate of others and that she can read situations...all while ruining a group picture, smearing someone's calligraphy and interrupting a love confession, in that order.

However, she's <em>so</em> determined to keep Riley happy constantly that she often pushes the other emotions — and especially Sadness — aside so she can run things her way; at one point, she forces Sadness to stay in a small circle and read manuals about the brain to keep her from interfering with Riley's first day at a new school. Joy doesn't do any of this maliciously, but it still hurts, and much of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> throughout the movie is learning that Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust have an important purpose in Riley's life.
</li><li> Being a movie all about stereotypes and how even the most open-minded people can have bigoted tendencies, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> has a few characters who do this.
<ul><li> Judy, despite striving to be open-minded, made remarks at her press conference about predators being naturally predisposed to violence which ends up inflaming predator/prey tension across the city and almost ruins her relationship with Nick.
</li><li> Clawhauser is introduced this way.

</li><li> Judy does it early on in the movie when first meeting Nick, calling him "a real articulate fella!" Nick snarks that he rarely meets people so non-patronising, indicating this is a negative stereotype foxes face regularly.

On the good side, Koda says what's on his mind and doesn't mince any words, telling Kenai important things that he (at first) doesn't want to hear. But on the bad side, he sometimes doesn't know when to stop talking and can be unaware of how this affects others.

Having only a few weeks of social experience, he has a tendency to say unintentionally rude things, like complaining about a form being attention-getting to mutants who can't shapeshift to <em>not</em> look attention getting. When he gets the chance, he enthusiastically signs up for sensitivity training so that he can learn not to hurt people's feelings. At least, not when he doesn't want to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>, this is lampshaded, and happens several times over.
<ul><li> Sir John, who in all respects is a kind and generous man who gives Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters a home after her worthless stepson and daughter-in-law force them out of their own<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mn99');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mn99" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mn99');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">due to the entail of her late husband's estate</span> teams up with his mother-in-law Mrs. Jennings to tease Elinor about her "beau" with the initial of F. (that information being given by likewise innocently insensitive Margaret, the youngest Dashwood sister). They routinely tease any young friend about romance in nothing but good humor and well-wishes, but in this instance it's quite painful; Elinor really is in love with Edward Ferrars, and has to constantly pretend that she's not, both because his family would never approve his marrying a girl as poor as Elinor and, worse, he's secretly engaged to another woman and she's the only one who knows it.
</li><li> Marianne, who eventually throws a tantrum at the endless teasing she herself endures from Mrs. Jennings, brushes off Elinor's explanation that the older woman means well by saying that Elinor can't possibly know how she, Marianne, is suffering. (She's properly ashamed when she learns of Elinor's situation.)
</li><li> Near the end of the book, Edward is disinherited when his secret engagement to Lucy Steele comes to light. Colonel Brandon, whose own family forcibly separated him from his sweetheart as a young man, decides to grant him the parish living on his own estate. As he's not well-acquainted with Edward, he asks Elinor to act as intermediary, not realizing that he's asking his friend to speed up the marriage of her love to another woman.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, it is mentioned that Ward pretends to be this as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>.

<ul><li> Princess Eilonwy has moments of this.
</li><li> In the third book, King Rhuddlum is a bit guilty of this, as he explains to Taran that he's hoping to eventually betroth Eilonwy to his son Rhun - not even slightly aware that Taran himself is in love with Eilonwy.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on interpretation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>. Opinion varies on whether he's genuinely socially inept or deliberately spiteful to people who aren't as smart as him. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009">2009 film</a> favours the latter explanation, but critics who stress Holmes' loneliness as a character trait favour the former.
<ul><li> The BBC series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> seems to use a bit of both - he once asks John whether a comment was too insensitive, but also makes fun of everyone for not understanding his deductions. We haven't seen much of the loneliness outright yet, but he sure does get upset when John's in danger. He <em>claims</em> to be a sociopath, as well, but the fact that he shows genuine concern for another human being pretty clearly tells that if he has a disorder, it's not as serious as he thinks. Or perhaps John is just the exception. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> from Moffatt is that Sherlock is a) full of crap and b) <em>wants</em> to be a sociopath; he thinks his intellect would be much more efficient if it wasn't for all this <em>caring</em> about stuff getting in the way.
</li><li> Both presentations may be correct. Individuals with exceptionally high IQs often have difficulty with proper social interactions, usually coming off as either distant, patronizing, or outright arrogant and insulting (even when it is not their intent). Psychologists think it comes from their altered viewpoint of reality. People with high IQs easily make intellectual connections and usually have a better understanding of things. But even when they know intellectually that it is due to their high IQ, they can't always grasp why no one else gets it or may be frustrated by how they need to explain "simple" things. For Sherlock, who likely has a very high IQ, he doesn't get why everyone else can't see the world the way he does. To him, he is pointing out things on the same level of obviousness as "The sky is blue" and then dealing with people who are so dense they need it spelled out to them (even though no one else would ever make those connections).

Green Eyes gets angry and swats him twice with her front paws and runs away with her babies.

For example, when the party go to the Temple of Lightning so Sheena can make a pact with Volt (which she failed to do once before), Lloyd asks Sheena how they deactivate the traps.

She's in charge of Ludger's huge debt and repeatedly calls him over the course of the game to remind him to pay back his loan in segments. Unfortunately, since she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">locked out of what exactly Ludger is doing</a>, she often calls at inopportune times or when the debt is the last thing on his mind.

He says that Baron Schwarzer adopting him into the family has sparked a whirlwind of controversy around him, causing him not to show his face among the nobility except on special occassions. This only upsets her.
<div class="indent"><strong>Elise:</strong> ...You don't get it. <br/><strong>Rean:</strong> Wha...? <br/><strong>Elise:</strong> You don't get it all... you don't understand how Father feels, you don't understand how Mother feels... and you don't understand how <em>I</em> feel. <br/><strong>Rean:</strong> Elise...? <br/><strong>Elise:</strong> You're the worst! Why do you always have to be so stubborn?! I hate you, I hate you!!
</div></li><li> Of course, that wasn't the first time Rean got in a tight spot due to him opening his mouth without consideration towards his audience or their reaction to what he says. Earlier in the game, during the field study in Celdic, Laura recognizes Rean's sword style and is impressed by it. Rean, on the other hand doesn't think the same way, believing himself to be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">a dropout who's never even been able to progress past beginner level</a>," feeling that he couldn't go farther in his abilities, which prompted his master to cut his training short. He apologizes to Laura for not meeting his expectations, but she plainly states that he has no reason to apologize to him, adding that it's a matter he needs to come terms with by himself. The morning after, when the group is gathered for the next set of tasks, Rean apologizes to Laura once more, only to be fed the same line from last night. This prompts Rean to expand on his apology, saying that what he said was disrespectful to his master, the school he follows and the way of the sword, which he apologizes (again) for making light of. Hearing this, Laura delivers her response.
<div class="indent"><strong>Laura:</strong> If that's the case, then there is one other person you should be apologizing to as well. <br/><strong>Rean:</strong> ...? <br/><strong>Laura:</strong> I can't pretend to know much about your personal circumstances. But regardless of one's background or social standing, one should always be able to live with pride in him or herself. Thus, if you truly did make light of yourself and your own abilities, it is an act of shame for which you owe yourself recompense.

With that said, due to his exposure to hip-hop culture, Yusuf thinks the n-word is something cool that people in the West call each other and is unaware of the word's historical context.
</li><li> The first chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> are packed with this. Examples include Hope ranting about how terrible his father is (unaware that Sazh is a father at his wits' end trying to save his own son), Sazh telling Vanille that he used to be skeptical of the government's anti-Pulse mania but now agrees that they were right all along (unaware that she is secretly from Pulse), Snow telling Hope that fighting the army is a thing for dumb adults to do in an effort to discourage him from getting in danger (unaware that Hope's mom got killed doing that when volunteering to help Snow).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune">Deltarune</a></em>, Susie tries to reassure Lancer that she's in no danger from his dad because she, Ralsei, and Kris will thrash him easily. She doesn't quite take into account that Lancer is worried about <em>him</em> too and the more she goes on about it, the more it looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> between seeing his friends killed or his father.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, Tidus does this <em>very</em> often by talking to Yuna about what will happen after her pilgrimage is finished, not knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she'll die performing the Final Summoning and defeating Sin</span>.

It shows when you return to Outset Island; talk to Zill, and he'll bluntly but innocently ask Link if he's rescued his kidnapped little sister Aryll yet, to his brother and mother's shock.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> has a couple of cases:
<ul><li> Subaru is probably the biggest offender - he has a hard time understanding other people's feelings, particularly negative ones, which can lead to him seeming very insensitive. In reality, he genuinely does care about other people, and doesn't try to hurt people deliberately. It doesn't help that he doesn't even understand <em>his own</em> negative feelings very well, either, which makes it hard for him to express this regret or guilt.
</li><li> Adonis occasionally does this as well, due to being rather awkward and not good at speaking. In particular, his motivation to protect 'the weak' can cause unintended offence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity">Pillars of Eternity</a></em>: Edér often unwittingly says offensive things (and promptly apologizes for it) thanks to growing up in a xenophobic small-town in Dyrwood. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">orlans</a> are second-class citizens in Dyrwood, often stereotyped as thieves, so he tends to reflexively say stuff about them that he learned growing up without realizing that most places consider what hes saying to be prejudiced, such as inadvertently calling his friend Hiravias <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">one of the good ones</a>. In the second game, he specifically turns down starting a romance with an orlan Watcher because of this, noting that this trope doesnt go well with a romantic relationship.
</li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, Lee and Kenny are trying to get in a locked building when Kenny innocently asks Lee (who is black) if he knows how to pick a lock.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a>:</em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a>:</em> Liara has a tendency to be this, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, especially in conversations with Shepard.

Said training involved a viciously racist turian instructor, who Kaidan eventually killed in self-defense, something he still feels guilty over.

This causes a lot of important information to get lost in the translation given to their commander.

He's actually a kid with good intentions, but as he's young, naive and often misinterprets advice from other adults, he usually ends up causing more bad than good for people.
</li><li> One episode of the 90s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen">Mr. Men</a></em> cartoon has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones">Mr. Forgetful</a>'s habit of forgetting things cause him to unintentionally hurt Miss Star's feelings.

<ul><li> Pinkie Pie often falls into this trope.
<ul><li> In "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000", she can't stop gushing about how great the cider at Sweet Apple Acres is, despite Rainbow Dash (who didn't get any cider) growing increasingly irritated. What makes it even worse is that Pinkie Pie had also a) gave the suggestion to other ponies to camp out in front of the cider stand, b) was in front of said line and c) put up a pile of coins and walks off with at least <em>ten</em> mugs of the frothy stuff without realizing that others wouldn't get sips. Thankfully she gives one of her mugs to Rainbow Dash at the end.
</li><li> The episode "A Friend in Deed" is basically twenty minutes of Pinkie Pie annoying Cranky Doodle Donkey while trying to cheer him up.
</li><li> And she unintentionally helped cause the termination of Nightmare Night in "Luna Eclipsed" due to managing to alienate Princess Luna. She genuinely thought it was just part of the fun.
</li><li> She takes this to the extreme during "Filli Vanilli", constantly setting off Fluttershy's stage fright and upsetting her.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">Twilight Sparkle</a> is pretty prone to this herself.
<ul><li> In "Baby Cakes", she innocently tells Pinkie that she knew that Pinkie probably couldn't handle the responsibility of caring for baby twins. She doesn't seem to notice that Pinkie is offended by this, even as she is pushed out the door.
</li><li> In "The Last Roundup", Twilight slams the door in the face of a mailpony after getting a letter from Applejack. <em>On his birthday</em>. Granted, she was worried about her friend, but you can't help but feel sorry for him. (Pinkie Pie does give him a slice of cake, though.)
</li><li> When researching the Mare in the Moon, she dumps a pile of books on Spike's head looking for the right one, and doesn't even notice.
</li><li> In "Spike at Your Service" she once again is so buried in her work fails to notice Spike as he tearfully explains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">he is honor-bound to serve Applejack</a> and must leave her. She is visibly guilt-ridden when Applejack later coaxes her out of her studies and explains what happened.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Dragon Quest" has Rarity telling Spike that he's better than the other dragons, because he has something special that they don't. Spike gleefully asks what it is, and then Rarity says he has "The cutest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTalk">widdle</a> chubby cheeks," unintentionally humiliating him in the process:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rarity:</strong> Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger? <br/><strong>Spike:</strong> Waddle!? <strong>GAAHHH!</strong>
</div></li><li> Spike himself has bouts of this due to his sometimes obnoxious sense of humor and inadvertent bluntness. In "Hurricane Fluttershy", he constantly aggravates Fluttershy's low confidence concerning her poor flying skills, but just doesn't get why Twilight keeps giving him nasty glares.
</li><li> Fluttershy also falls into this at times, such as when she makes Rainbow Dash's stage fright even worse in "Sonic Rainboom", describing how <em>everyone in Cloudsdale, including the Wonderbolts and Princess Celestia</em> would be watching her and see any mistakes she made.
</li><li> Speaking of Rainbow Dash, this could be a reason as to why she starts off seemingly uncaring about Fluttershy's phobias in the early episodes, even willing to prank her. She has impatience in "Dragonshy", doesn't realize her spending time with Gilda is essentially alienating her friend Pinkie Pie, teases Spike for wearing an apron in "Dragon Quest" in her lust for cider, ends up making Fluttershy feel uncomfortable in "Bats", destroys the Cloudsdale weather factory to stop winter just to spend more time with her tortoise, shoves said tortoise to the side in the episode he becomes her pet, tries to get Fluttershy to fly in the tornado by pushing her against her will, (though Fluttershy goes anyway because of Rainbow Dash, she still is told to suck it up by Rainbow Dash before the pegasus quickly realizes who she was talking to and changes her tone) and even unknowingly causes Scootaloo to be afraid of the Everfree Forest by telling ghost stories.
</li><li> The Cutie Mark Crusaders, when inviting Babs Seed into their club, make her painfully aware of her lack of a cutie mark, something she came there to forget about in the first place.
</li><li> Among the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle tend to do this without thinking such as leave their friend alone when she's clearly broken about being teased for being unable to fly, Sweetie unknowingly almost causes Rarity to lose her job just from changing a stitch, and Apple Bloom when she finds the toy Big Mac and her used to play with, kinda just shrugs it off leaving her big brother to be very hurt.
</li><li> Starlight Glimmer is this trope personified in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">villainous</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">heroic</a> versions, as everything she has done in the series to date was based around having good intentions but messing up <em>badly</em> due to her lack of tact and simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">just not thinking</a>.
<ul><li> As a villain, she really did have good intentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">and a point</a> taking talents away from other ponies, as differences do create problems between friends, except she still held onto <em>her own talent</em> in order to do so, exposing her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>, completely undercutting her entire message and making her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist">Not-So-Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>.
</li><li> After turning over new leaf and graduating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, Starlight Glimmer still uses her magical talent to solve problems, only to not only fail to fix things, but actually make things <em>worse</em>. In "No Second Prances", Starlight uses her magic to create a cake, except it ticks off the non-magical Mrs. Cake, who believes Starlight is trying to put her out of business.
</li><li> Starlight later ends up scaring away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">Big Macintosh</a> by casting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">a talking spell</a> on him so she can talk to him more.
</li><li> Starlight's insensitivity really comes to the forefront in "Every Little Thing She Does", where she once again uses magic, a mind-control spell in particular on her Mane Five friends in order to her friendship lessons done more efficiently. Unsurprisingly, it spectacularly fails (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">works too well</a> depending on how you look at it), effectively turns them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">subservient mindless meat puppets</a>, and the Mane Six are <em>furious</em> with her afterwards. Starlight Glimmer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed">still hasn't quite gotten</a> the message about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">irresponsibly resorting to magic</a> to solve problems.
</li></ul></li><li> In "Once Upon a Zeppelin", Twilight is upset when she misses out on seeing the Northern stars fly by with her family, even breaking down into tears. And then Candance walks up to her and tells her how awesome it was. Talk about adding insult to injury.
</li></ul></li><li> Jet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> can be like this at times. For example, in "Night of a Bazillion Stars" he takes Sean's birthday telescope just to see how it works, and breaks it. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">promptly chewed out</a> by Sydney for this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>: In the season 1 episode "Officer Mikey", Mikey wanted to be a safety ranger, going as far to say it's his dream. His friends work hard to make his dream a reality, doing a bunch of favors to different kids, until they finally get him into the safety rangers. Afterwards, the gang go into school, happy they made Mikey's dream come true, only to be shocked to find Mikey eating in the cafeteria. Mikey told them he quit, because the safety rangers were too much hard work. Mikey tells his friends he has a new dream of being a jet pilot; as he's telling his friends this, he does not notice how shocked and devastated they are because of all the work they did for him was for nothing.

<ul><li> Subverted in "Eeny Teeny Maya Moe", when Moe tries online dating. He is surprised to see his date, Maya, is a little person, then immediately apologises and asks what the correct term is. Maya tells him that he got it right with "little person".
</li><li> In "Homer Badman", Homer gets mistakenly accused of sexually assaulting a woman because he was oblivious to seeing how peeling a candy off someone's butt could be taken the wrong way. He fails to even notice Ashley running out of the car terrified.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Butters</a> in the episode "The Hobbit":

She's a really nice girl! <br/><strong>Butters:</strong> I think she's a nice girl, too! She's just too big for me.
</div><ul><li> The Main Quartet can all fall into this category, though Stan is the biggest offender, being slightly more naive than the other three. One example is in Cherokee Hair Tampons where he cries about Kyle possibly dying from an untreated illness... to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">Kenny</a>. Kenny points out that no one ever seems to care when <em>he</em> dies (they all forget about his death the next day, so its not like they know that Kenny can come back to life, they just dont seem to <em>care</em> when he dies), but Stan doesnt take notice, even when Kenny is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">randomly crushed by a falling piano</a>.

<ul><li> We have the title character himself. Although SpongeBob means well, he unintentionally ruins other peoples' lives. Just ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Squidward</a> or his boating school teacher Mrs. Puff. It was taken at its worst in "Demolition Doofus" when after his driving caused Mrs. Puff to pop her inflation sac, SpongeBob, who is clueless to what's going on, makes very insensitive comments about her serious condition by saying she should be now called Mrs. Pop, and that he actually likes her that way. It was so bad that this drove Mrs. Puff into attempting to murder the sponge.
</li><li> Due to Patrick's intelligence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">(or lack thereof)</a>, he doesn't realize when he's being insulting.
<ul><li> In the episode "I'm with Stupid" Patrick convinces Spongebob to act dumb so that his visiting parents don't think he's an idiot. Patrick's mom and dad immediately begin insulting Spongebob, and Patrick merrily joins in on verbally attacking Spongebob. It gets to the point where Spongebob has to plead with Patrick to drop the charade over how horrible he's being treated, with Spongebob reassuring Patrick his parents will love him no matter what. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">thinking he is the more intelligent one between them</a> and joins his parents as they double down on the insults.
</li><li> In "Driven to Tears", after Spongebob fails, yet again, his driver's test, Patrick decides to take it himself and passes it on the first try with minimal effort. For being being issued the one millionth drivers' license, Patrick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">wins a new boat-mobile, and immediately starts behaving incredibly condescending towards Spongebob.</a> When Patrick finally notices Spongebob is upset, he assumes that he's upset over the fact that he's a terrible driver, rather than the fact that Patrick keeps bragging over how he got a free car after passing the drivers' test while SpongeBob didn't.

<ul><li> A common trait with Pearl in that she doesn't pick up much on what Steven or other humans say or think until she steps over the line, and was unable to realize how upset Amethyst was about her origins.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pearl:</strong> No, no, Amethyst, you're not the mistake.

</li><li> Rose Quartz was also not immune to this back when she and Greg had started dating. Rose laughs at Greg's attempts to fuse with her in order to get intimate in the same way she can with Pearl, and she says that she loves <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">humans</a></em> because they're all so funny.

When Steven explains that she hurt Amethyst's feelings, Peridot cannot understand what she was saying is wrong and offensive. Peridot has similar issues with Lapis Lazuli. While she understands that Lapis has genuine grievances against her, her attempts to make amends consist of apologies like "Sorry but you were just <em>so</em> useful at the time."
</li><li> Sardonyx. When she is trying to figure out the capabilities of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steven and Amethyst's fusion</span> Smoky Quartz, she unintentionally makes it all about her and does a number on Smoky's ego. When she realizes what she did, the horror makes her de-fuse.

When Grace slips and falls, she is mortified and embarrassed. Doris, however, doesn't realize this and thinks it's just a funny story, which she tells to some of the other kids the next day at lunch. Grace overhears and is terribly upset and crying, calling Doris a "blabbermouth." Doris, angry, calls her a "crybaby." They give each other the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentTreatment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentTreatment">Silent Treatment</a> for a while, until they finally talk it out and Doris apologizes for what she did, as she genuinely didn't realize that Grace was embarrassed about having fallen.

<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Chloe Park</a> first meets the bears, she uses them as the subjects for a research report for one of her college classes. However, the bears are not amused when they read her report and find that she mainly focused on traits such as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eating habits</a>, odor, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero">lack of social skills around other humans</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when the bears attempt to make the report more "factual", but everything turns out okay in the end.
</li><li> Charlie the Bigfoot, especially in his first appearance, was initially seen as an annoyance by the bears, due to actions such as commenting on Panda's (lack of) love life, and messing with Ice Bear's cooking. However, the bears soon learn that because Charlie is constantly having to move around due to being hounded by Bigfoot enthusiasts who desperately want his picture, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">he's never been able to make any real friends</a>. As time goes on, the bears' relationship with Charlie gets better, and they consider him a real friend.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRenegadeAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRenegadeAngel">Xavier: Renegade Angel</a></em> begins with Xavier coming to the aid of a boy in a wheelchair he thinks is getting bullied by two other kids. Not only are those two other kids the boy's friends, but Xavier is so condescending to the wheelchair-bound kid while defending him that the two kids beat him up over it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Xavier:</strong> Look, I'm not 'tarded like Robbie here, so I know a group of strapping young bucks like you would never waste your time with a boy whose legs are as dead as a Thanksgiving turkey with all the trimmings. <br/><strong>The "Bullies":</strong> You apologize right now! <br/><strong>Xavier:</strong> I'll <em>never</em> apologize for defending the weak, the meek, and the useless!

<ul><li> People with poor social skills — children and shy people who haven't had much chance to interact socially especially — are also prone to this. It's a recognized trait of Autistic Spectrum Disorders to have some difficulty at picking up non-verbal cues that would alert them to other people's feelings.
</li><li> Can also happen when you go to another culture. Even if you speak the language, the complexities of social interaction can take a while to learn, and it'll often involve a lot of unintentional insults to the people whose country you're in before you figure out what you should and should not do.
</li><li> Researchers such as Dunning and Kruger have studied for years how well most people estimate their own ability levels or competence and the ability levels or competence of other people. They have found that people who are highly competent and/or highly intelligent nearly always <em>overestimate</em> the ability levels of the average person while <em>underestimating</em> their own ability levels (because it never seems that difficult for them); in contrast, unskilled people nearly always overestimate their competence (because they lack the knowledge and metacognitive skills necessary both for that level of self-assessment and for successful use of feedback). That's right: the more talented one is, the more likely one is to assume everyone else is just as talented.
<ul><li> This has the sad side effect that extraordinarily competent people may come across as snobbish because they constantly have to remind themselves not to expect the average person to be able to keep up with them.
</li><li> It can make for a bitter, painful life when one must constantly choose between the loneliness of always being out ahead of the pack or hobbling oneself until one is as slow as everyone else. Studies like these only make it easy to sympathesize with snobs and both male and female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitches</a> of the intellectual variety. Of course, most people who think they have this problem, as the cited research points out, don't.
</li><li> Less talented people feel insulted when told that the task they failed at, or invested a lot of effort to accomplish is "very easy", leading to a situation where highly intelligent people, by trying to downplay their intelligence, achieve the exact opposite of the intended effect.
</li></ul></li><li> The term "microaggression", which refers to any kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot">thoughtless comment</a> that someone might take offense to (such as using the slang of another culture or referring to someone by the wrong gender), even if it's unintentional, has recently cropped up in the public consciousness, mostly through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">social</a> media.
</li><li> Anyone who tries to get an introvert or a shy person to open up by forcing them to be social. To them, it is trying to help someone out of their shell. To the person they are trying to help, however, it can come off as them being forced into something they are <em>highly</em> uncomfortable with.
