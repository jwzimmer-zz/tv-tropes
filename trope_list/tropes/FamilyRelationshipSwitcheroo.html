</p><p>Many family secrets are kept both in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and fictionland. Orphans are one of the most popular character tropes, especially ones who turn out not to be orphans; the most famous example of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a> situation wherein a thought-to-be unrelated character (often a villain, usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>) turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s parent. But sometimes these parents are hidden closer to home; sometimes, for some reason or other, they pose as a different relative — aunt, uncle, etc. and play a part in bringing up the child.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The most typical example of the trope would be an "older sister" who is actually a mother and "parents" who are really grandparents, a situation that was frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> before premarital sex and childrearing out-of-wedlock became less taboo. (See the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section for more historical detail.) In fiction set in the past, this may still be the reason for the Switcheroo. In contemporary society, the damage done by forcing the family to lie to the child and to the outside world is generally seen as much worse than an admitted out-of-wedlock birth — even if the child is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents">Raised by Grandparents</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism">other relatives</a>, they will know who their birth mother is. Contemporary Switcheroos (both in real life and in fiction) are likely to be concealing a much darker and more potentially damaging family secret, such as a pregnancy caused by rape or incest.

It should be pointed out that sometimes the focus of the story is the "older sister" and not the child, or the focus is on both equally.

</p><p><strong>Note that any Switcheroo is a straight use of this trope. It does not have to involve a parent in any way, and there are no inversions or gender-inversions. Also, beware of spoilers.</strong>

Mitsuyo gave birth to twin girls, Mei and Misaki, but Yukiyo miscarried and fell into depression. Meanwhile, the Fujioka family was having financial problems from caring for two children, so when the twins were two, they sent Mei to the Misaki family. They presumably sent Mei because if they sent Misaki, her name would be Misaki Misaki. The switch was kept secret for several years, but their grandmother slipped up one day. The girls began to secretly spend time together, but sadly, Misaki died a few years later.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izzy/Koushirou Izumi</span> overheard his parents talking one night about how they were not his biological parents, and they wanted him to remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption">ignorant of this</a> until he was older. After a period of angsting about it, his parents finally had a long overdue discussion about the adoption with him, and he found out his father was in fact his biological father's cousin - they had adopted him after his birth parents had died, since they had recently lost a child of their own.
</li><li> In the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em> it turns out that the parents of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jun are actually his aunt and uncle, and accordingly, his younger sister Kana is actually his cousin. This was necessary because his real father died during gang warfare and the mother entrusted her child to her relatives, since she was also in danger. And although she approaches with her son and becomes a volunteer to save him, unfortunately she dies before he knows the truth.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoiKaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoiKaze">Koi Kaze</a></em> deliberately teases the reader with this, and then specifically averted to show that this is an artificial happy ending and trying to deconstruct the genre, rejecting tropes like this.
</li><li> Played for drama and in general Zig Zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool">The Irregular at Magic High School</a></em>. In the 16th volume, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maya, the aunt of the protagonists Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, states that Tatsuya is actually her son, which turns the brother and sister into first cousins ​​and makes it possible for them to get married. However, further in the volume it turns out that this is a lie invented for the purposes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">Royal Inbreeding</a>. Miyuki was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBaby">Designer Baby</a> artificially created from the DNA of Tatsuya's parents; it is implied that as a result of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">she and Tatsuya are genetically closer to half-siblings anyway</a>, which will ensure the birth of healthy children despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a>. Maya was clearly not afraid that the DNA test would show anything unusual, and Tatsuya's real mother will be very difficult to identify, since Maya was the twin of their mother and has identical DNA.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> also plays with this. First we are told that Rin is a very young aunt of the protagonist, who was born from his grandfather's connection with a young girl who worked in his house. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, at the end of the series it turns out that his grandfather just claimed Rin as his daughter to hide that she was the result of an unwanted pregnancy and she prevented her mother from building a career.</span>
</li><li> In <em>The Will</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a>, Hiroko's sister Taeko commits suicide, leaving a note in which she promises to curse someone from beyond the grave — but the intended victim's name is obscured by a blood stain. It's revealed that Taeko was actually Hiroko's cousin, and her "parents" were her biological aunt and uncle (leading the family to believe that the reason for her suicide was the stress of finding out she was adopted.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaquiaWhenThePromisedFlowerBlooms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaquiaWhenThePromisedFlowerBlooms">Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</a></em> has a variant induced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyYoungParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyYoungParent">Supernaturally Young Parent</a>. Part of Maquia's cover as an ordinary human is to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeOrDie">Dye or Die</a> to make herself look like the natural mother or the ordinary human baby she adopted. However, Maquia is fifteen, the age at which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">Immortality Begins at 20</a> kicks in for her tribe, when she <em>starts</em> the masquerade.

<ul><li> In Wildstorm comics' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATs">Wild CA Ts</a></em> it was revealed that Zealot, who has looked out for her "little sister" Savant since she was born, is actually Savant's mother.

However the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> was pushed on the entire title the issue after this was revealed, so God only knows if it's still in-continuity.

Richard Parker was still his father; in this version, Mary and May were best friends dating two brothers, but May and Richard had an affair.

Despite the Irish/Catholic setting of Binchy's books and the time period the book is set during, it's revealed that this was NOT done out of shame because of the situation—the woman explains that her mother's reaction to her pregnancy was to simply say "won't it be grand to have another baby around here", thus revealing that she had her family's unconditional love and support. The "deception" simply came about because no one ever bothered to explicitly tell the girl what the situation was—indeed, they thought that she already knew.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Up until the 1970s (when the Pill and legalized abortion became available and cohabitation became acceptable) it was common for young women pregnant out of wedlock to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StigmaticPregnancyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StigmaticPregnancyEuphemism">"sent away" before they started to show and to give birth in secret.</a> "Homes for wayward girls" were essentially private maternity wards where women were heavily pressured to give their children up for adoption (as long as they were white  at the time the adoption prospects for nonwhite babies were... pretty grim). Birth mothers might not even be allowed to <em>see</em> their babies before they were taken away to the adoptive parents. Faced with losing her child forever, it's not hard to see why a mother might prefer becoming an "older sister" who could still be part of the child's life. <em>The Girls Who Went Away</em> by Ann Fessler is a good source for those looking to learn more about maternity homes and forced adoption. While many children of young unwed mothers are still raised by their grandparents, it's much less common for families to bother concealing the underlying biological relationships.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>'s "older sister" was really his mother while the woman who was allegedly his mom was actually his grandmother. His real mother did it because she had sex with a man (both were unmarried) who ended up leaving her and she didn't want anyone to know that she was an unwed mother (both Nicholson's grandmother and mother died before he found out this family secret). In a height of coincidence, he learned this just as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown">Chinatown</a></em>  in which he starred  was about to open in theaters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a> was born when his mother, Patricia Clapton, was 16 years old; his father was a Canadian soldier who shipped off to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> before Eric's birth and then went back to Canada. He was raised believing Rose and Jack Clapp, his mother's mother and stepfather, were his parents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobbyDarin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobbyDarin">Bobby Darin</a>'s mother, Nina Cassotto, was 17 and unmarried when he was born, and he grew up thinking his parents were Nina's parents (even though her father died of pneumonia a year before he was born) and that Nina was his older sister. He didn't learn the truth until he was 32 years old, and the identity of his biological father remained a very closely-guarded secret right up to Nina's death in 1983.
</li><li> Australian singer David Campbell's real father was Jimmy Barnes, who would go on to become an Australian rock icon, but he was raised by his mother's parents, believing them to be his own parents.
</li><li> Serial killer Ted Bundy suspected for years that his older sister was in fact his mother, finally learning it for a fact in 1969. Even worse, she might very well <em>have</em> been his sister after all, given the heavy, yet unproven speculation that he was the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Parental Incest</a> between her and his grandfather.
</li><li> Civil Rights/gay rights activist Bayard Rustin grew up believing Janifer and Julia Rustin, the parents of his biological mother Florence Rustin, were his parents and that Florence was his older sister.
</li><li> Novelist Catherine Cookson was raised believing her parents were Rose and John McMullen, who were in fact the parents of her real mother, unmarried alcoholic Kate Fawcett (it didn't help that her father, Alexander Davies, was a bigamist and a compulsive gambler).
</li><li> Anglo-Indian actress Merle Oberon likely saw no reason not to believe that Charlotte Selby was her mother, as she was only in her mid-twenties when Oberon was born. However, her real mother was Selby's illegitimate daughter Constance, who had been born when Charlotte was fourteen years old and whom Oberon believed to be her sister; Oberon herself had been born when Constance was <em>twelve</em> years old. Her father was listed on her birth certificate as Charlotte's partner Arthur Thompson, but he was neither her father (whose true identity remains unknown) nor her grandfather (who was an Irish tea plantation foreman named Henry Selby).

They had to find out the horrible truth after the police finally caught and arrested Garrido.
</li><li> Upon the announcement of her candidacy for Vice-President of the United States in the 2008 elections, rumours began to circulate that Gov. Sarah Palin was actually the grandmother of her youngest son, and that his oldest sister was actually his mother. Subverted, as the rumours were soon proved completely unfounded; one of the giveaways was that the boy, Trig, had Down's Syndrome, which is <em>far</em> more common with older mothers. Her eldest daughter, Bristol, would later get pregnant out of wedlock, but the Palins decided to be public about it.
</li><li> In the Middle Ages it was not unusual for popes to have illegitimate children (such as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI">Pope Alexander VI<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s children, Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia) that they bestowed favors upon, although it was considered gauche to publicly acknowledge their paternity. Instead, they were referred to as "nephews" or "nieces" of the pope. This is the origin of the term "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>".
</li><li> In 1939, a then-5-year-old girl from Peru named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp">Lina Medina<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was taken to the hospital for a tumor in her belly. During the examination, it turned out that she was <em>pregnant</em> (she had gone through puberty at an <em>unusually</em> early age). She gave birth via c-section to a young boy, but was told her whole life that he was her younger brother. It is not known who his father was; Lina's father was jailed on suspicion of incest, but he was released for lack of evidence, and Lina herself wouldn't say who had done this to her. She lived a pretty normal life otherwise, and later married and had another son (this time one that she actually knew was her son).
</li><li> William Moulton Marston (creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>) was legally married to a woman named Elizabeth but had another wife named Olive Byrne.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x1pe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0x1pe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x1pe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The exact nature of the triangular relationship remains a mystery. Its not clear if it was truly a three way relationship or if it was more of a sister wife situation. The reason Elizabeth allowed for Olive to live with them in the first place was because she wanted to work full time and Bill told her she could if there was another woman around to raise the kids and she needed his permission to sit for the bar exam. Bill and Elizabeth both worked while he was alive while Olive was the full time parent to the kids. Elizabeth became the sole breadwinner after he died while Olive remained the caregiver. They lived together for forty years after Bill passed away. Elizabeth and Olive could have been platonic, they could have been lovers. No one, not even their children, quite knows for sure.</span> As this would have been extremely scandalous at the time (he died in 1947), his kids by Olive were told that he was their uncle who adopted them and took care of their mom when their dad died. They didnt know he was their dad until they were adults, long after his death.
