The mask's power lets its user warp the future to cause more disasters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in exchange for becoming the mask's puppet and eventually dying. The mask then compels the nearest person to pick it up and use it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are small magical items called Behelits. They look like eggs with human facial features scattered around them at random. When their possessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">hits an emotional nadir</a>, the features rearrange into a screaming face, and the four members of the Godhand appear to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">offer the Behelit's owner the chance to become a demon</a>... by sacrificing those close to them. And then there is the <em>Crimson</em> Behelit, owned by Griffith, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> transforms its bearer into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a member of the nigh-invincible, demonic Godhand</a>.</span> Curiously, the Behelits are mentioned to be completely harmless most of the time. It is only at <em>one specific moment</em> when held by <em>one specific person</em> that they become dangerous, and unfortunately it's almost impossible to tell when or who those are beforehand.
</li><li> There's also Guts' Berserker Armor, which removes a human being's natural limits by nulling pain and allows the user to keep fighting by temporarily mending broken bones, stitching together wounds, etc. It's very dangerous for the obvious reasons that your body has limits for a reason and bypassing them is bound to hurt you, but it also has the effect of bringing out the wearer's "inner beast" (in the Skull Knight's case, his familiar skull motif, in Guts' case, "The Beast", his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound">Hell Hound</a> evil side), turning him into a raging monster incapable of distinguishing friend from foe. After using it just once, Guts got a patch of white hair, became partially colorblind, and lost some of his sense of taste. Constant use of it might have reduced the Skull Knight to his current ghastly state.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> The library of 103,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">grimoires</a> in Index's brain counts. Not only do the grimoires themselves contain spells of incredible destructive power, the knowledge itself is dangerous. When one mage tried to absorb just <em>one</em> of the books <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while trying to obtain a healing spell to save a girl he loved from a curse</span>, he nearly suffered a fatal aneurysm. The mage then wonders just what Index is considering that she can store the entire library in her mind without any negative side effects.
</li><li> Dáinsleif would probably also count since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it will trigger Ragnarok if it is fully unsheathed. Fortunately, its wielder can't bring herself to do so and it is destroyed shortly afterwards.</span> In fact, this particular artifact of doom is so doomy that its first use seen is to cause <em>fatal heart attacks</em> just by threatening to use it!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage">The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage</a></em>, dwarf-forged tools and weapons tend to be cursed. Gods and Valkyries are too powerful to be affected, but anybody else who tries to use them will suffer misfortune and death. The dwarves tend to do this out of revenge for their customers threatening and/or cheating them. When Jack Elvan (who was unaware of the threat of cursed tools) pays upfront and is polite, they give him a curse-free tool.
</li><li> This is the entire point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CubeXCursedXCurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CubeXCursedXCurious">Cube×Cursed×Curious</a></em>, where the series revolves around the idea that a cursed item eventually becomes intelligent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">able to take human form</a>. And being cursed is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">just as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">traumatic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">to them</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DaCapo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DaCapo">Da Capo</a></em> - the Giant Sakura Tree; though it is explicitly stated that it only fulfills one's fervently wished for desires, for some reason, it always end up working towards unimaginably evil ends (in the second season, it defeats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">Power of Love</a>). May be linked to its tendency to fulfill unconscious wishes even when this goes against the conscious desires of the user.
<ul><li> Sakura states in the second season that the tree's purpose of granting wishes may be inherently damaging as it disrupts the struggle which is central to human life, thereby disrupting the process of human life itself. Essentially, since people don't know what they want granting it to them will inevitably go awry.
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous notebook from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> kills those whose names are written in it. This is slightly different from most of the other examples on the list, in that it doesn't appear to be sentient or possess any kind of supernatural corrupting power — the danger comes entirely from the power it places in the hands of the user, and how he decides to use it.

<ul><li> Alterations made to the Star Brand mythos later, by Warren Ellis and Jonathan Hickman change this. The Star Brand isn't necessarily a AOD. It's supposed to be a planetary defense system.

As time went on, the sheer uselessness of the item made it hold a peculiar fascination to people, and news of it apparently spread globally.

No points for guessing ahead of time that it will backfire horribly on Iznogoud himself. Just to name a few examples:
<ul><li> In "Dark Designs", Inzogoud acquires a magic pencil; when he draws a picture of someone or something and then tears the paper in half, the subject of the picture is banished to an alternate dimension. He can't get the spell to work until he takes art classes, and during an idle moment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">his teacher</a> sketches Iznogoud. When Iznogoud's art skills have finally improved, he sketches the Caliph and tears the page in half... unaware his teacher's sketch of him is on the other side of the page, so that they are both banished, and the Caliph ends up as sovereign of the island to which they were sent.
</li><li> "The Box of Souvenirs" sees the title object, a camera, sold to Iznogoud by Japanese tourist Judoka Karate; when he takes a picture of someone or something with the camera, that someone or something is trapped forever in the photograph that results. Every time Iznogoud tries to take the Caliph's picture, someone or something gets in the way and disappears instead, and when he finally gets the Caliph alone, he is standing in front of a mirror and bends down at the crucial moment, causing Iznogoud to take a picture of his own reflection and disappear.
</li><li> The title character in "The Merchant of Forgetfulness", Mumbaijumbo, sells Iznogoud a perfume which, when sniffed, causes instant and total amnesia in the victim. Iznogoud sprinkles it on the Caliph's flowers and food and finally puts it in an atomiser, but they are all sniffed by other people before the Caliph can get to them, and inevitably, the final victim is Iznogoud himself, who is left an empty shell.
</li><li> In "The Jigsaw Turk", Iznogoud buys a 10,000 piece jigsaw from joke shop merchant Dokodah Bey; when the last piece is put in, the person of whom the puzzler is thinking will disintegrate into 10,000 pieces. There's one problem: there's a piece missing, which Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf have to retrieve from the factory, several days' journey away. After several further failed attempts to finish the puzzle, Iznogoud is forced to retrieve the missing piece from the palace bins; meanwhile, Dokodah Bey has found the missing piece in his shop, but the Caliph is the one who takes delivery of it, and Iznogoud returns with his own copy of the missing piece... just in time to see the Caliph put the last piece in, beaming that he's always thinking of Iznogoud. The luckless vizier disintegrates immediately.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Skull of Agarash</em> graphic novel, a spin-off from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf">Lone Wolf</a></em> series, the eponymous demonic cranium is yet another evil artifact that needs to be destroyed by Lone Wolf.

It's also addictive, and can't be removed by anyone other than the person wearing it (unless the wearer himself allows it).
</li><li> Satirized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nodwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nodwick">Nodwick</a></em> by "This One Ring", which is a One Ring parody that inspired an epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>-esque plot based on <em>hype</em> alone.

<ul><li> The print comic also features a straight example in the Gauntlet of Supremacy.

If youre strong in the Force, Muurs spirit will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">take over your body</a>. If you arent, Muur will abandon you in favour of someone who is, leaving you at the mercy of your formerly-obedient rakghouls.

<ul><li> The Darklord weapons and the Death Staff are examples of evil weapons that have great power, but aren't healthy if their users aren't evil incarnate.

Meaning that the strongest antagonists can use them with impunity, but Lone Wolf collapses as soon as he gets <em>near</em> one. The Doomstone of Darke featured in Book 16 <em>The Darke Crusade</em> deserves a special mention here. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, it turns out to be the REAL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the book, having made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> its frail, near-undead puppet.</span>

The downside is: it contains the spirit of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (a.k.a. the Necromancer), so it will eventually corrupt anyone else who wears it, or owns it, or even sees it. Also, it's virtually indestructible, and the quest to destroy it takes about three-quarters of the plot.
</li><li> The <em>palantíri</em>, also from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, are basically just sort of far-seeing crystal balls, but they are functionally dooming at the time of the story, because Sauron got hold of one and used it to psychically attack anyone who uses the others. (Victims include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Saruman, Denethor and Pippin.</span>) They also seem to exert a strong fascination and temptation to use them for some reason or other, but maybe that's just hobbit curiosity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aragorn breaks the spell and wrests the palantír for his own purposes right after he <em>spooks Sauron</em> by showing him, reforged, the blade that cost him the ring and a finger</span>

Including Morgoth, who wears them in his crown even though their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyBurnsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyBurnsEvil">holiness burns him</a>.

It's a sapient artifact forged from the souls of several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">liches</a>, capable of constructing crystal towers that can focus sunlight into beams, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">corrupts the wielder</a>.

Despite not having any meaningful understanding of what evil is, Nightblood excels at the "destroy" part, and anyone with ill intent will feel compelled to pick it up, and will soon be involuntarily killing their partners in crime, while good people will feel overwhelmingly nauseous simply at the sight of it, although they can get over this to carry it. It does, however, like to urge its proper owner to kill almost anyone so... yeah, we'll call that a design flaw.

Dorian cannot age and stays young forever thanks to its power, but the painting turns more horrible and wretched with each evil act that Dorian performs, as a physical manifestation of his tainted soul. Dorian is drawn to and repulsed by it. By the end of the book, he has the painting locked in his attic, afraid to even look at it. In a fit of conscience, he decides to destroy it, unable to bear to look at his aged and wicked face from the canvas. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He stabs it, but in doing so, actually kills himself.</span> While the portrait isn't actually evil, it reflects the evil in Dorian.

In both games, the only way to get rid of them is to finish the game (assuming it hasn't killed you first). However, even if the heroes do manage to finish and dispose of the game, more often than not it will just worm its way into the hands of another group of unfortunate saps.

And it even allows him to resurrect, as long as the sword remains in his hand, leaving him even stronger — hence harder to kill — than before. Unfortunately, the resurrection doesn't actually heal the wound that killed him (at least not immediately, or gently) and hurts, leaving Rhulad even less sane every time he's killed. And we've also seen, in the time between his death and resurrection, the Crippled God (the sword's creator and the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>) takes the opportunity to pound on Rhulad's soul before sending him back.

Therefore, anyone exposed to the knowledge bank will have their minds completely taken over by it, causing them to degrade and eventually shut down (die).

One can give one's own eye and hand to use these artifacts, but you have to cut off your hand or gouge out your eye to use it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>. Oh yeah, and both of them <em>will</em> eventually result in you being absorbed into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">their original owner</a>.
</li><li> And there's a story about the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.blindpanic.com/humor/vecna.htm">Head of Vecna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is supposedly used in the same way, but doesn't actually do what the user expects. It does, however, do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">exactly</a></em> what anyone with an ounce of sense expects. Even if it <em>did</em> work as advertised, it would still be a tremendously stupid idea to use it. His <em>hand</em> turns you evil, imagine what his <em>brain</em> would do.
</li><li> Another Artifact of Doom associated with Vecna is the Sword of Kas, a weapon he made and gave to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">second-in-command</a>, Kas the Bloody Handed. Kas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">turned against him</a>, and the resulting battle between the armies of the two evil beings killed both of them, leaving only the Sword and Vecna's Hand and Eye behind. Both were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>, of course; Vecna, as stated, became a demigod, while Kas became a very powerful vampire. The Sword of Kas is said to be a potent weapon for anyone who would oppose Vecna, but it is <em>incredibly</em> evil, and a hero who tries to use it for this purpose risks turning into a bloody, merciless warlord like Kas himself.
</li><li> The Demon Lord Orcus (the one who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">has a Trope named after him</a>) owns one of the most dreaded artifacts in the game, the Wand of Orcus, which is actually a rod topped with a skull. (In the 4th Edition, the shaft is part of a vertebra.) Orcus rarely lets it out of his sight, but some sources say that he "lends" it to worshipers occasionally to spread evil and chaos. The Wand not only kills victims, it turns them into powerful undead monsters under Orcus' control. (Just which type depends on which edition of the game.) No-one can agree on just who the skull used to belong to; some claim it was a god of goodness and light who Orcus murdered, while others say it was a great mortal hero who challenged him and failed (though, if that is true, magic must have been used to enlarge it). Whatever the case, the goodness of the soul the skull once belonged to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil">has been corrupted into blackest evil.</a>
</li><li> Evil-aligned artifacts in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> generally act like this; the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> lists some, and is named after a particular example.
</li><li> The 4th Edition took this to its logical extreme with the Heart of the Abyss; a shard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">pure evil</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Asmodeus</a> stole a <em>sliver</em> off the shard, crafted it into a rod, and used it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">kill the strongest of the gods</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Blood</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">War</a> fought between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">devils</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">demons</a> was spawned by this; Asmodeus wants the rest of the shard for himself, and the demons want the piece he stole back.
</li><li> The Book of Vile Darkness is, itself, a cursed artifact of sorts in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Originally penned by a race that seeks to kill deities, other evil wizards, including Vecna, contributed to it, and it is now a spellbook that contains some of the most vile magic known.
</li><li> The Book of Keeping is not truly a cursed artifact, but still a dangerous one in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> world. This book contains information on summoning powerful yugoloths, even giving the true names of a few of them. No-one knows who wrote it — given that he would likely be the yugoloths' most hated enemy, he may no longer be alive. At least four copies of the Book exist, although some say as many as seven, and their owners tend to change frequently.
</li><li> Notably, even some <em>good</em> artifacts are like this. It's not so much that they're overtly malicious, as opposed to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe">being unforgiving</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">intended for someone else.</a> They don't necessarily mind being used for a bit, but be respectful. It is pretty much the rule for <em>all</em> major Artifacts throughout <em>D&amp;D</em> that each of them must come with some curse or drawback. If it ain't cursed, it ain't an Artifact. This was stated explicitly in the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D <em>Book of Artifacts</em>, and is implied elsewhere.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em>: Madrak Ironhide's axe, Rathok.

Just reading it requires the unfortunate bastard in question to make a high-difficulty Willpower roll; if they fail, they pick up a form of insanity involving obsession over the tome and its contents. Its many-storied lore paints its various copies as imperfect reflections of the true tome that will come into existence at the dawn of a new dark age of Creation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In reality, the "true" copy is the book the Scarlet Empress wrote to try to wrest immortality from the Yozis. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">That</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">did not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">go well</a>.</span>
<ul><li> The Third Edition supplement <em>Arms of the Chosen</em> contained examples such as the Forgotten Blade (a sword with powers to erase the memories of those struck by it, and ultimately erase people killed by it from the memories of others), Stormcaller (a katana containing a demon that causes a hurricane to start building every time it's unsheathed, and tries to instil a love of destruction in the wielder), Gorgon (a sword made from the prison of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turn people to stone</a> and feeds on them), and Karvara, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">the Walking Devil Tower</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mecha">warstrider</a> acting as the prison for a reality devouring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">erase people from existence</a> by eating them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">takes control of its pilot</a> when they Limit Break).

It's written into the rules: they can give you great power, but once a season, the Narrator can cause you to automatically fail a roll by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom">"DOOOOOOOM!"</a> A good Narrator will do this at the worst possible time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Kult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Kult">Kult</a></em> has rules for possessed or otherwise evil items. One example is a machine gun that, when picked up, causes the wielder to go on a murdeous rampage, shooting everything in sight, friend or foe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> has these things cropping up quite frequently:

</li><li> Angrar Robotics, seen in <em>Rifts:Mercenaries</em>, offer a powered armour and a giant robot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which are actually demons, one for each crew member, forced to assume the shape of robot parts and sold to mercenaries. Slowly the crew takes on demonic qualities, and eventually the whole thing falls apart back into the shape of the demons, consuming the crews as the demons no longer need them.</span>
</li><li> One episode of the Rifter featured a series of items, one of which was claimed to be terribly powerful, and grant great power to the user, but this is unknown as it is lost on Rifts Earth after a series of events in which the holders of the item were quickly killed by various means before they could work out how to use it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Devils' Six-gun, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a>:Reloaded</em>. While introduced in a comic book which shows the process of its creation, stats are given in the back to allow its use in the RPG. The thing can cause an explosion if all six of its special rounds hit the same traget without a miss or reload, which is shown to be sufficient to bring the house down. If you use it even once, for good or evil, the fates no longer smile on you, and certain uses of Bennies are denied to you - the more commonly used ones.
</li><li> <em>1001 Science Fiction Weapons</em> for D20 has some of these, from the Benadanitto Torc and Black Gauntlet, which are legendary items with minds of their own and their own agendas, and aren't evil but will often convince, or even force, people to perform unsavoury acts in order to fulfil their goals and stop at nothing; through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Fulgichrome Blade</a>, which is a living sword capable of infecting wounds to cause nasty effects and telepathically communicating with its wielder in order to subvert them and make them bloodthirsty killers, as it likes to see suffering; to the Morituri Staff, capable of self-repair and self-powering but no longer working as well as it should, and permanently draining 1 HP per day from the user, and the Xugulor, which attaches to the users arm, can only be removed surgically, and permanently drains 1 CON per 2d10 of damage it does. Also there are minor examples under other chapters, such as the whole chapter on radioactive weapons. Some of these are somewhat sophisticated, but not much better than the most basic, which is just a bar of radioactive material.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has the Relics of Kazavon, a set of seven powerful artifacts crafted from the remains of the dragon Kazavon. Bringing the seven relics together and resurrecting Kazavon is the goal of a religious group devoted to the god Zon-Kuthon, who had blessed the dragon and made him into His champion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BetrayalAtHouseOnTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BetrayalAtHouseOnTheHill">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a></em> has Omens that include stat-boosting objects and powerful weapons but each time you find an Omen, the Haunt — a scenario in which the heroes have to fight something evil and one of them almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">becomes a traitor</a> — has a chance to be triggered if you don't roll well enough and the chance increases with each new Omen you find. Its expansion <em>Betrayal Legacy</em> also has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Helm, which initially seems to be a benevolent artifact that gives you rerolls but turns out to be the thing keeping a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> alive and filling it up completely opens portals to Hell</span>.

<ul><li> The Ring of the Nibelungs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRingOfTheNibelung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRingOfTheNibelung">operatic cycle of the same name</a>, cursed by its maker to destroy all who possess or covet it. The curse comes with a truly ominous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>, which plays every time someone is killed because of it. Wagner, in loosely adapting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> example above, extended the symbolism of the lust for gold, relating it (in typical 19th c. fashion) to the "<em>Wille zur Macht</em>", the fundamental anti-social aspect of which he symbolized in the idea that the Ring could be made only by one who had renounced all natural affections.

As observed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Altaïr</span> in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Codex</span>, where he states <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"I freed myself.

</li><li> Interestingly, in "The Tyranny of King Washington" DLC, it appears that this is the effect of the Apple that was given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, who then goes on to turn the new United States into a dictatorship bent on world domination.

</li></ul></li><li> The demonic sword Soul Edge from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Series</a></em> of fighting games. The sword invades the mind of its wielder and turns it into its host body, removing his self-consciousness and turning him into a bloodlusting machine whose only goal is to offer the souls of those he slay to the sword. The sword's influence can also affect the user's physical appearance in varying degrees, the most common effect being a demon-looking deformed arm.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a> IV</em>, some of the characters' story paths imply that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Soul Calibur, the "good" counterpart of Soul Edge, may be evil as well.

<ul><li> In the Human campaign, the runesword <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Frostmourne</a> (a clear <strike>knockoff of</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga">The Elric Saga</a>'s Stormbringer) curses Arthas.
</li><li> In the Orc campaign, the blood of the Pit Lord Mannoroth corrupts Grom Hellscream and his band, turning them into Chaos Orcs.
</li><li> In the night elf campaign, the Skull of Gul'Dan (a powerful warlock) turns Illidan Stormrage into a mighty demon, and after using his new powers to defeat the Dreadlord Tichondrius (a major threat to the night elves), he's exiled by his brother for being tainted with evil. In the expansion pack, he <em>does</em> end up becoming evil, so maybe his brother was on to something. (Although Illidan's problems go far beyond the artifact he absorbed, and it's not been directly confirmed that the Skull sent him over the edge.)
<ul><li> He also acquires the Eye of Sargeras (the actual eye of a corrupted titan who became pure evil, ironically created the Burning Legion which possessed the Skull of Gul'dan and which Tichondrious was a lieutenant in) in the expansion, which is to be one of those too, having the power to kill people on the other side of the world (shattering the world in the process).
</li></ul></li><li> The novels bring us the Demon Soul, probably the worst of them all. Created by one of the Dragon Aspects under the influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">eldritch abominations</a>, it's immensely powerful (among other things, it can control all dragons except its creator and affects its user much like the One Ring does). Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">eldritch abominations</a> end up underestimating that attraction, and their scheme fails as a result.

Oh, and it's also the source of power of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chronopolis and it can't be accessed because the arbiter is now someone else.</span> In a nutshell the thing is wanted by every single Big Bad of the game.

To put it in perspective; everything wrong in Termina when you get there? All of it was done either directly or indirectly by the Skull Kid wearing the Mask. And on top of ruining everyone's lives, he's planning to drop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">frickin'</a> <em>moon</em>, destroying the entire land of Termina.

<ul><li> The Fierce Deity Mask from the same game is noted in its description to potentially be every bit as bad as the titular Mask, and going by how it turns the final fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Majora itself</span> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">Curbstomp Battle</a>, it may be a great deal more powerful.

</li><li> The Fused Shadows, which are hyped up to be an Artifact of Doom by the Light Spirits that Link rescues throughout the game. However, they all agree that, despite the potential for evil the Shadows hold, Link needs to collect them in order to have a chance of challenging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zant's</a> power. Their power is proven when a single fragment can turn a Deku Baba into a vast two-headed monster, or an ordinary Goron into a low-budget Balrog that causes Death Mountain to constantly erupt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And it's later revealed that the three fragments only make up <em>half</em> of the Fused Shadows. The other half is the strange helmet thing that Midna wears, and with them, she pops Zant like a balloon, using only a 'fraction' of their power - though Ganondorf isn't so remotely fazed</span>. They don't corrupt Link or Midna - though the risk to Link is graphically illustrated by Lanayru in a horrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a>. It's suggested that like most Twilight magic they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">not inherently evil</a>, just incredibly dangerous, and Link's Triforce and Midna's powers (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> plus the fact that she's the rightful owner</span>) insulate them. Instead, the main corruption is implied to come from the temptation of power itself.
</li><li> Just one shard of the Mirror of Twilight from the same game turns demure, unassuming Yeta into the crazy ice-monster Blizzeta. Afterwards, Midna comments on this (as well as regretting that they had to hurt Yeta to free her), saying that they could be assembling something terrible which they might end up having to destroy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (as Queen of the Twili, she later decides to do exactly that, to prevent another Ganondorf or Zant wreaking havoc on their respective worlds)</span>. Ironically, once intact it's actually faar less dangerous. In pieces, the influence it has is... questionable.

</li><li> Most if not all of the twenty-seven True Runes in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series are Artifacts of Doom. They give their host a supernatural ability and make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>. However, each True Rune has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">will of its own</a>. What a rue Rune wants is more often then not horrifically mentally scaring or deathly to the human that is in possession of it. Examples of this include:
<ul><li> The <em>True Rune of Punishment</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> By the time characters figure out what it is, the rune has killed <em>everyone</em> who is seen using it. In an optional scene, the main character can overhear a discussion where other characters discuss who's going to get the rune next <em>after it kills the main character!</em>
</li><li> The Sun Rune of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em> grants nearly God-like power, but at the cost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">their sanity</a>.
</li><li> The Soul Eater Rune from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI">Suikoden</a></em> <em>will</em> eventually kill the user's dearest friends and family to become more powerful.
</li><li> The Bright Shield and Black Sword runes are fine in and of themselves, but only two people that are close to one another (friends, family, etc) can use them, and they will be forced by the runes to fight each other.
</li><li> The True Elemental Runes (Fire, Water, Lightning, Wind and Earth) are trying to gain dominance over each other by forcing their hosts to over-use their powers.
</li><li> The Moon Rune turns one into a vampire.
<ul><li> Sealing them away won't work , since even if one is able to do so they will die once the last of the True Runes magic leaves their body. However there are ways of mastering the power of a True Rune, Often times this will involve the bearer of a True Rune gathering the 108 Stars of Destiny. In the case of the True Rune of Punishment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this requires forgiving Snowe, whose cowardice and mistakes in the beginning of the game led to the main character's exile and disgrace in the first place</span>. The Rune of Punishment governs atonement <em>and</em> forgiveness, so this act shifts it into the "forgiveness" phase. Some other True Runes require other means for example, The mind altering effects of the Sun Rune can be dealt with by two control runes branded on each hands to use properly.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Terror Mask from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse">Splatterhouse</a></em> series is a sentient, diabolic mask (roughly shaped like a grinning skull) that grants its wearer tremendous power.

</li></ul><ul><li> In the game based on the manga of the same name, the Anubis Stand from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> is the Stand of a sword, rather than a living being. In a similar way to the above Soul Edge, the Anubis Stand possesses whoever removes it from its scabbard and turns them homicidally insane. Three characters in the game (all from the manga) use the sword while being controlled by the Anubis Stand. The Anubis Stand is still capable of controlling others even when the sword had been broken into pieces by Jotaro (although its attempts to make a child throw a large piece of the sword at Jotaro's back leads to the stand's defeat as it ends up at the bottom of the River Nile).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnoftheObraDinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnoftheObraDinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></em> the Shells which are responsible directly and indirectly for almost every death in the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there are 3 separate mutinies trying to steal the shells, a group of mermaids attack trying to get the shells and then get captured, and then a bunch of spider crab riding monsters and later a kraken attack the ship to save them, the monster attacks only stop when the 3rd mate gives the last surviving mermaid the shells and frees her, but it's already too late almost everyone is already dead</span>

Each game seems to feature at least one as part of its main quest, with others showing up in the side quests or deep backstory. To note:
<ul><li> Throughout the series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon">Legendary Weapon</a> sword, Umbra. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> novels, it was too much for even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clavicus Vile, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a></em>, to handle. It steals a good chunk of his power before he manages to get rid of it.</span> The sword <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">absorbs the souls</a> of the people it kills and corrupts the wielder - one to the point where the sword supplanted her identity and she was known by its name as a remorseless killer. Though it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">no apparent effects in gameplay</a>, it always has a new wielder by the next game...
</li><li> A number of artifacts associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Princes</a>, especially the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">malevolent ones</a>, qualify throughout the series. Most don't have an 'air' of "doom" on their own, but the means to acquire them often gives them one. For example, a person carrying Mehrunes Razor or the Mace of Molag Bal had to do <em>something</em> for the Daedric Prince of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Destruction</a> or the Daedric Prince of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Domination and Corruption</a> (respectively) to make that person worthy of receiving the artifact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">Arena</a></em> features the Staff of Chaos.

Prolonged contact with it can turn a mortal into a god. However, it has a huge price for using.

The aura comes from the fact that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">Restraining Bolt</a> against a powerful demon, and it won't hurt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Paladin</a> unless the Paladin wants it to... which is unlikely at best.
<ul><li> <em>Mmmmaybe</em> a bit less of a subversion than it initially appeared; the Axe <em>is</em> holding a powerful demon imprisoned, but when it's used for motives that aren't <em>absolutely</em> pure, it weakens the demon's prison. When the goblins used it in a tricky way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> hurt a paladin (a Blood Knight Templar paladin, but somehow a paladin nonetheless)</span> it was severely weakened and came <em>very</em> near to breaking outright; one accident later, it's actually starting to fall apart, which will release the demon.
</li></ul></li><li> The Shield of Wonder is a straight example: it provides a random, usually very squicky, effect each time it blocks a weapon.

It also halts the bearer's aging, which has the apparent side-effect of preventing he or she from maturing as well.

</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation">Inspiration Manifestation</a>" spell is inscribed on a stone tablet-like book covered in spikes, kept in a secret part of an ancient castle, on top of a pedestal the stairs leading up to which start to collapse if the book has been moved, guarded with a barred and locked gate. <em>This should have been a hint.</em> Sadly, Spike fails to take the hint and brings the book to an unwitting Rarity, who uses the spell and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">Mad Artist</a> consumed by the desire to reshape the world according to her own creative whims and enough magical power to do so with little more than a thought.
</li><li> Chrysalis's Throne from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2">To Where and Back Again  Part 2</a>". Thorax describes it as "carved from an ancient dark stone that soaks up outside magic the same way changelings soak up love." It generates an Anti-Magic field capable of depowering even Equestria's Physical Gods or Goddesses. Its influence also seems to make plant life whither, turning the area around the Changeling Hive into Mordor. Fittingly, its destruction is the go-to solution for all the problems faced by the heroes.
</li></ul></li><li> It's been speculated that Gideon Gleeful's amulet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is one, but nothing has been confirmed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The second book itself, though, is most likely the cause of Gideon's madness.</span>
</li><li> "Dodj or Daar" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> counts as one, as whatever punishment card you pull is made reality until the game finishes. This includes one player's arm doing whatever another's does, making you unable to walk on the ground due to it being 'lava', and most terrifying of all, <em>making all the players physically unable to breathe</em>. There's a reason Gumball and Darwin first hid the game under their bed, then threw it away.
</li><li> Both versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</a></em> are full of these things, but likely the worst is the Star Seed from the original version. Supposedly created as an aftereffect of <em>the creation of the universe</em>, anyone holding this small, glowing sphere can do <em>anything</em> simply by requesting it. The problem is, nobody can hold such omnipotent power without being tempted by "its dark side" (as the Sorceress described it), and even He-Man almost succumbs to it when foiling Skeletor's attempt to claim it, though eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> is enough to resist doing so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPussInBoots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPussInBoots">The Adventures of Puss in Boots</a></em> features the Scimitar, an evil talking sword that bends its user to its will and compels them to kill for it. It turns the heroic Thriffith completely evil, while Puss in Boots manages to subdue it with a little bit of struggle, and the (almost) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> of Dulcinea allows her to wield it for an extended duration, but even she starts to become gradually more evil as time passes. El Moco, however, is evil enough that the sword doesn't need to control him entirely, because their beneficial goals put them on the same page.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> special "The Smurfic Games", Gargamel's cousin Argus gives Papa Smurf a powerful and dangerous magical item called the Medallion of Poseidon that he wants to see buried. Gargamel, hearing about the medallion from his cousin before he died, rescues the only book that didn't disappear with his cousin when he died and from it puts together all the items necessary to unleash its destructive power. Although Papa Smurf has buried the medallion and rendered its power inert, Brainy mistakenly unearths it and has Painter paint gold over it to present it as the Smurfic Games medal. As Clumsy is awarded with the medal which turns out to be the medallion, Gargamel recites the incantation that unleashes its destructive power ("Ravage the land as never before, total destruction from mountain to shore.") and thus the entire forest and village is rocked by a serious earthquake. Papa Smurf uses his magic to bury the medallion into the earth, thus stopping its destructive power from consuming everything.
</li><li> The Inferna Copula from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters">Trollhunters</a></em> is a ring that houses the sorcerer/bounty-hunter Angor Rot's soul. Should another wear the ring, Angor's will is forced under the control of the one who wields it.
</li><li> The Infinity Sword of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperHeroSquadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperHeroSquadShow">The Super Hero Squad Show</a></em> turns out to be this in Season 2, turning the person who holds it evil. Turns out one needs the Infinity Gauntlet armed with the six Infinity Gems to be able to hold the damn thing without it possessing you.
</li><li> Again with the Infinity Stones in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em>, the Stones actually have One Ring-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices">whispers (in your own voice)</a> tempting you to use them.
</li><li> The characters of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> ran into these with alarming frequency, as befit the adventurer nature of the series. The straightest example was probably the Idol of Doom, a small statuette that could cause calamities based on a specific couplet.
