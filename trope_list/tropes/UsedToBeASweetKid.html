Works, and audiences, may vary considerably as to what point they consider a character to be past the adolescent stage here, but post-adolescents in general need not apply.
</p><p>Aversions will usually be notable here, given expectations that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">Children Are Innocent</a>, or that there's at least some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousInnocence">Ambiguous Innocence</a> even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">Kids Are Cruel</a>, so people will tend to assume a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> <em>must</em> have happened, and that there <em>will</em> be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> that will explain (if not excuse) all. By extension, this trope frequently applies through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> etc. where an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> junior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">initially manages to get past everyone's radar but is actually a little horror from the start</a>. ("And he <em>seemed</em> like such a nice kid"). Often, it is not clear which a character fits under, which in turn often leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a>, especially if the character is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Generally, the trope tends to be reserved for villains near the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> end of the villain spectrum, but can also be played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">What Measure Is a Mook?</a>. Also, while this is most commonly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains">villain trope</a>, it can apply to characters who are not so much aligned with evil as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">troubled</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear">bitter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">twisted</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">cynical</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerky</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">despairing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">lacking</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">emotions</a> or insane. Or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. Or just going through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">puberty</a>. (In the latter case, expect the parents to invoke the trope name.)
</p><p>When played straight, this trope tends towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">Rousseau Was Right</a>, though if other villains and darksiders in the same work do not fall under this trope, Rousseau may have only a partial victory, and the trope is sometimes used as the exception that proves the rule in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight">Hobbes Was Right</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a> scenarios. Also frequently used, straight or otherwise, to make more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a> points about free will, destiny, individual responsibility, or the moral version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Handled well, this trope can really add depth and complexity: handled badly, especially by combination with a poorly executed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, it tends to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>.
</p><p>Often related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>, though the character may be of some prominence from an early age, or even from birth. This subset of the trope can be heart-breaking, as when a long-awaited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a> turns bad. Also often the precursor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>. In these cases, expect it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> with extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> moments. It's also often invoked to make the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil">Cry for the Devil</a>. If they weren't just a sweet kid, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a>, they may be a dark version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHeroAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHeroAllGrownUp">Kid Hero All Grown Up</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, the "used to be nice" stage may be revealed only retrospectively, often by a third party, and the villain himself/herself may treat the "sweet kid" stage as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">undermines</a> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">Villain Cred</a>. This last one may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, as the villain furiously denies their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> past, often complete with stomping on cutesy childhood toys and memorabilia. Or it may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight">"I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight</a> with the good guys.
</p><p>Compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp">She's All Grown Up</a>, in which the character may have been a sweet kid, but is now a very attractive woman. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeMoreSocial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeMoreSocial">Used to Be More Social</a> in which the character used to be a social butterfly, but has become introverted and withdrawn. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedBully">Reformed Bully</a>, a character who was mean and/or smug while young, but is a much nicer person now, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerTeenRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerTeenRebel">Former Teen Rebel</a>, a character who was rebellious and immoral while young, but is no longer like that.

The downfall started when he was three and his foster mother Sys died of the plague, leaving him to be raised by his sadistic and hateful foster father Gambino. Even after being trained for war and serving on the front lines, he was still a pretty innocent kid, until the night after his first battle when Gambino <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sold him to another soldier for three silver coins, a soldier who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">liked little boys in the wrong way</a>, resulting in a traumatic rape despite Guts' best efforts to fight the man off.

He has no qualms about getting involved in dangerous missions and will command his badass butler Sebastian to kill someone without a second thought. He has also been shown slapping and insulting individuals for being too comfortable with touching or speaking to him. The only individual he appears to genuinely care for is his fiancee, Elizabeth Middleford, although he does seem to view her as a bit of a distraction and a nuisance, at times. In the anime, he appears downright cruel at times, although in the manga, he is simply just icy and elitist. It's eventually revealed that he was a happy, loving, carefree child before his tenth birthday. Then his parents were murdered, the mansion set on fire, and he was kidnapped by a fanatical cult. He was locked in a cage with other children his age, was implied to be raped, was force fed all his meals, and eventually was to be a child sacrifice until he accidentally called upon the demon Sebastian in his desperation to live.
</li><li> Alois Trancy in the second season. He was shown to be cute and innocent as a child but then his foster family died in front of him, from unknown supernatural means, including his adoptive brother and only friend, and then he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was horrifyingly raped and abused by his master, Lord Trancy, alongside other boys.</span> A few years later he's shown to be creepily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.

His personality was much more sweet in his childhood than in the present. He used to cry a lot and was much more shy, and was always looking up to Asta instead of teasing him. The change was most likely due to the promise he made to himself of never crying again, after Asta protected him against a robber.

</li><li> This is a prominent theme in <em>Code Geass</em>, while some characters like Rolo are proven to always have been killing machines since childhood (and often, like in Rolo's case, thanks to the brutal training and brainwashing coming from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geass Cult</span>), loads of characters started out like sweet kids even up to the Emperor but also including, C.C., Suzaku, possibly Cornelia and Clovis, Karen and Lelouch Lamperouge.
</li><li> Suzaku is a bit of an odd case, since while he was mean to Lelouch and Nunnally at first, he was a good kid at heart who eventually befriended the siblings.

He grew so alone from the lack of love from his mother and father that—when Chiyo taught him the art of puppets—his first two creations were that of his Mom and Dad. But they could never replace the kindness, love, and affection that <em>human parents</em> could provide, which lead to the development of his twisted views on immortality, the sanctity of life, and how it was so fleeting and needed to be preserved...

Then, when she was eight years old, her family was murdered in front of her at dinner. Then the Gotham police sent her a "condolence" card that read "Many Happy Returns!"

</li><li> Downplayed with Tywin Lannister. He wasn't exactly <em>nice</em> back then, but according to his brother, he was much better as a person while his wife was around, since she was one of the few people that could make him smile or laugh.

All of this was done <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">out of sheer boredom</a></em> and shows absolutely no remorse for anything, believing himself to be victimized and in the right.
<ul><li> In the end, it's shown that Giygas and/or the Mani Mani Statue were playing on his desire to be liked, when he states one of his main motivations for destroying the world to be so that "...everyone who won't like me is gone."

Her child self, Lily, is kind, purehearted, reasonably intelligent, heroic, and tried to save Christmas. (She's also none too happy about her older self.) What makes this an odd case is that Jeanne Alter never <em>had</em> a childhood, having been created by magic as an adult.

One night, an entity known as Ogre attacks their home and in the aftermath, Jun is missing. Respecting his mother's wishes, Jin goes to his grandfather Heihachi and asks him to train him to avenge his mother. At the age of 19, Jin enters the 3rd King of Iron Fist Tournament and makes it all the way to the final contestant, Ogre. After he defeats Ogre, he is then gunned down by Heihachi and his soldiers. Jin reawakens and becomes Devil Jin (thanks to the Devil Gene he inherited from his father) and smashes Heihachi through a wall and flies off into the night. Since then, he has nothing but hatred for his paternal side of the family and will do anything to be rid of them and his curse, even if it means putting the world in danger.
<ul><li> Before Jin was his father, Kazuya, who used to be gentle in nature. After having endured his father Heihachi's abuse for years, he finally snaps when the old man tosses him down a ravine as part of a do-or-die trial to see if he was worthy of inheriting the Mishima Zaibatsu. That event both drove him to hatred and awakened the Devil Gene inside him, allowing him to survive to get revenge and try to take over the world.

</div><ul><li> As a child, Sarah Lynn was as sweet and friendly as the character she played on <em>Horsin' Around</em>. She lost her innocence early, and a life of Hollywood/music industry excess had turned her from a charity-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a> into a spoiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Drama Queen</a>.

Contrast that with how now-a-days with his first response to anything frustrating, no matter what or how small the problem is, his first response is almost always to get revenge.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, Denzel Crocker was a near perfect child who was loved by everybody.

</li><li> Trina Riffin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrojBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrojBand">Grojband</a></em> was once a sweet girl, but she locked her old self (known as "Katrina") away in her mind and turned evil (and at least one of the reasons why was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">to impress her crush</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>: "Helga on the Couch" shows us in a flashback that Helga Pataki was a normal girl who was so neglected and ignored by her parents that she had to walk to preschool by herself, getting splashed with mud and having her lunch stolen by a dog. She then meets Arnold, probably the first person to ever show her genuine affection, and immediately falls for him. After Harold steals her graham crackers and the other kids start laughing at her, she starts bullying them in order to get respect.
</li><li> Zig-zag: In the 1993 cartoon <em>Itsy Bitsy Spider</em> (based on the animated short subject that played with <em>Bebe's Kids</em> in theaters), Leslie—the little girl who befriends Itsy—was a sweet, introverted kid in the short and first season. Many episodes in season two have her a head-slapping bitch.
</li><li> Amazingly, Lucius VII on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>.

Then again, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the place he lives in</a>, it's probably no surprise he grew up the way he did.

In Season 3, she was a kind and caring person who rescued Korra's father from certain death and was devoted to Suyin. Suyin even claimed she was like a daughter to her. But the fateful fallout with her over how to save the Earth Kingdom and the subsequent 3 years would turn her into a cold, power-hungry tyrant.
