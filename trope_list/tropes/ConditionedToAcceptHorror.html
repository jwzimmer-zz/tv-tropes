<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Emperor Charles invokes the trope, believing the people will accept what they are forced into when given enough time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch defies this trope, saying that time will never happen and proves it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx">DARLING in the FRANXX</a></em>: Zero Two has been a prized military asset of APE and sent to fight on the front lines for so long that she has no regard for human life or her own, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">they all exist to fight and die</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">become a statistic anyway</a>. Heck, even when her beloved is dying, perhaps the one person she unambiguously cares about, she hardly bats an eye at it because, to her, it's just a fact of life that everyone dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> used this as an early conceit. The girls are very sweet and can pass for normal in public, but they cannot comprehend the idea that there's anything morose or negative in the fact that they must kill people on command, most of the time without knowing why. This is best summed up in an early story where Rico realizes she must kill a busboy she befriended earlier because he's a witness. At first it seems like she's hesitating for human reasons, but it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was trying to remember the words "I'm sorry". That she had to kill him was never a doubt in her mind</span>.
</li><li> Rei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. Her character relationship arc with Shinji is based largely on how he questions why she feels this is necessary. Mostly it's the fault of Shinji's dad.
</li><li> Hansel and Gretel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> end up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">Creepy Twins</a> due to this trope.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em> can accept anything life throws at him — death, being thrown into an extra-dimensional hell/prison, stuff like that. Most disturbingly, he actually conditioned <em>himself</em> into this as opposed to the usual premise of it having been performed by morally dubious characters. Naturally, this creeps the heck out of his friends.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Fate Testarossa</a> in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> seemed to genuinely believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">her mother's</a> abuse of her was a good enough substitute for parental affection, because she has never actually experienced the latter (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">other than in Alicia's memories</span>). So much, she even defended her mother's actions to her familiar Arf. It takes many years for Lindy to "decondition" her to accept real tenderness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">without tensing up</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hibiki</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodyMonday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodyMonday">Bloody Monday</a> Season 2</em> is perfectly understanding about the possibility of dying and being replaced because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only has she been trained to be a perfect agent since childhood, she also has seven identical clones and <em>all</em> of them were specifically bred for spying.</span>
</li><li> The "normal" people from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Miyu's homeworld</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA</a></em>. Illya comes to this realization when she realizes both of them automatically go "people can't fly" despite the magic they've seen. "The Ainsworths have taken their wings."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Endride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Endride">Endride</a></em>, assassins like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Mischa</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHumanTrafficking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHumanTrafficking">kidnapped as children</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">emotionally broken</a> and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> in order to become more effective killers for their owners.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">InuYasha</a></em>: All of the protagonists, sans Kagome, count to varying degrees. Miroku and Sango are so used to the mass destruction of their era that, while they're sympathetic to the loss of entire villages, they're also pragmatic about not being able to do much about it. Inuyasha takes the cake, considering that, in Episode 9, he thought nothing of stopping for a meal break in the middle of a <em>corpse-strewn battlefield</em>.
</li><li> The main characters and most of the community in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadeInAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadeInAbyss">Made in Abyss</a></em>. The value, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both financial and military</span>, of objects found in the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> results in the society on its fringes training orphans to mine its shallower depths. The community accepts this, despite the fact that many of the children are orphans <em>because</em> of the Abyss. By the time children are old enough to reach the deeper layers, they're supposed to be able to deal with the horrors and insanity that exist in the dark below.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012">Overlord (2012)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Victim, the eight floor guardian is a weird critter resembling a floating fetus with a halo and a cutesy voice, whose shtick is that when he dies (and he's purposefully easy to kill), the invaders are hit with all sorts of horrible status debuffs. This was all well and good when he was just an NPC, but now that he's an actual sentient being he's downright <em>eager</em> to be killed in defense of Nazarick, no matter how much Ainz apologizes and promises to resurrect him afterwards.
</li><li> Tsuare was forced to work as a prostitute in a brothel that throws the girls out when they're used up and caters to clients who like getting violent. When Sebas rescues her despite orders not to get noticed, Ainz decides to ensure that Sebas' loyalty is unchanged and orders him to kill her. She's so happy that he rescued her from that hellhole that she smiles at him and shows no resistance as he prepares to kill her in a single punch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately Cocytus blocks the punch, allowing him to determine that Sebas had every intention of killing Tsuare as ordered.</span> This reassures the other guardians that Sebas isn't going rogue, and the matter is dropped <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Tsuare is allowed to live at Nazarick as a maid.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, several of the witches, their barriers and imagery are rather creepy. However, veteran Puella Magi enter barriers day after day, and are unfazed by this. A good example is Yachiyo Nanami, a veteran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiaRecordPuellaMagiMadokaMagicaSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiaRecordPuellaMagiMadokaMagicaSideStory">Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story</a></em>. Special shoutout goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Homura</a>, who - after Sayaka and Madoka cowered before the sight of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mami dying gruesomely</span>, - defeats Charlotte like she was just another conquered castle. Explanation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Homura is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a>, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> here</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily">Mission: Yozakura Family</a>.</em> The Yozakuras are so hard on Taiyo that he's desensitized to most everyday thrills. For instance, when he and Mutsumi ride a roller coaster, he ends up falling asleep because it's <em>relaxing</em> compared to his daily training and frequent missions.
</li><li> In Episode 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SHWD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SHWD">SHWD</a></em>, Koga is stunned to learn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that a SHWD employee went berserk during a disposal and killed 5 of his teammates after forgetting to take his suppression drug. What horrifies her more is how nonchalant her fellow employees are about the matter, with one even mentioning that cases like this used to be a lot more common.</span>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, Bella Donna Boudreaux was raised to be a professional hitwoman, from at least the time she was eight years old, and possibly younger. As a result she has no qualms about committing murder.
</li><li> Hit-Girl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, has no qualms about vigilante murder and even killing mooks for money. She has been trained by her father to be a killing machine <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he wanted a more exciting life</span>.
</li><li> Frank Castle, AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>; a dark vigilante who derives a macabre thrill from gunning down scores of criminals. During his military service in the Vietnam War, Frank came to thrive in the bloodshed and chaos surrounding him; he craved combat. While the war was a traumatic nightmare for many who fought in it, Frank actually misses his time in Vietnam, and part of the reason he kills criminals is to continue waging a war that he should've ended long ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> The hitman Cain has raised his daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra</a> from an early age to be nothing but a killing machine. In fact, it was his intention that violence and martial arts be the only language in which she is fluent, and she is, for all intents and purposes, mute. While successful at making her into a nigh-unstoppable fighting machine, Cain's regimen actually backfired massively when it came to conditioning Cass psychologically. The first time she killed someone her abilities meant she could "read" all the target's emotions as he died, making the experience even <em>more</em> traumatizing than it would be for a regular six-year-old. She converted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> on the spot.
</li><li> Batman's own son Damian, who was raised by the League of Assassins and conditioned to not only kill but to enjoy killing.
</li><li> Batman himself is a milder example. While he does fight for a better world and never embraces its ugly side, his parents' death spurs him to understand how that ugly side operates so he can face it without fear.
</li><li> The Joker apparently has a clinical version of this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em>, one of the doctors discusses how the Joker is wired to accept the harshness of reality better than most normal people can. Since he lives in a hellholle like Gotham, this "super sanity" as they call it manifests as laughing at death, pain and fear.
</li><li> During her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a> training, Kate Kane lived for two weeks in a room covered in grisly crime scene photos and spent a majority of that time watching torture and murder videos to help completely desensitize her to the sorts of horrors she'd likely see as a vigilante. Prior to this, her military training at West Point would have had a similar, though less extreme, affect.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven">Raven</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden">Apocalypse Maiden</a> who, since birth, was trained to seal away her emotions, despite the fact that she was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empath</a> who thrived off other people's emotions.
</li><li> Carl Grimes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> has been forced into this in order to cope with death in the comics, though more in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafetyInIndifference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafetyInIndifference">Safety in Indifference</a> then being cheerful about it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a> is a peculiar example, because while she witnessed the murder of her family when she was eight years old, and was then raised by assassins who trained her to fight and kill, those same assassins also loved and cared for her and showed her real affection. They certainly did condition her to accept horror, but not out of cruelty.
</li><li> Bruce Banner, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>, forces himself not to react to the dangerous situations he finds himself in out of fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulking Out</a>, justified since as the Hulk he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> so the only thing he's really worried about is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker">what's gonna happen to the enemy.</a> This trait is carried over to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk">TV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">film</a> counterparts.

They were programmed to not see themselves as being alive, only lifelike, so they're all totally conditioned to the idea that they have no say in anything. However, hints are dropped that many Masters are starting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">Grow Beyond Their Programming</a> and defy this.

The same magic is useless against anyone from Terrenos because the constant, bloody warfare has raised the threshold for horror across the population.

While the rest of the class is horrified by Izuku, Bakugou, and Todoroki (who grew up in The Zone) casually dealing lethal injuries to their classmates, Izuku needs some time to understand what the problem is. During their first exercise, Izuku helpfully dispenses advice while killing his classmates, such as impaling Shoji while warning him about how painful stomach injuries are.

<div class="indent"><strong>Footnote:</strong> The seneschal Gyula von Mekkhan had had some peculiar views on children, also shared by his brother, who served as the first Schoolmaster. They were both convinced that children found skeletons extremely jolly, and had thus decided to cover every surface of the school in them. While in any other town, this would have revealed itself to be a horrendously bad decision leading to countless traumatized children, the children of Mechanicsburg were usually quite inured to the aesthetics of their home town by the time they reached school age, and if they felt anything at all about the school's choice of decoration, it was merely a mild puzzlement about why it was so overdone.

The entire premise of the movie is pretty much him demanding an answer to this question and not getting one. Later movies "solved" this problem by tossing Rambo into typical action movie plots against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> nemeses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FirstBlood">The original book</a>, by contrast, ended with Rambo killed as a result of his inability to adapt.

This type of assassination is very emotionally taxing, and combat training includes with it conditioning to help make close-range murder easier on the psyche. The main conflict in the movie comes when the main character, having gone through this training, is utterly unable to relinquish violence and reintegrate into the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Soldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Soldier">Soldier</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> squad is forced to watch a pack of dogs attacking a wild boar as children during their training, among other things (and it's implied that it's a regular occurrence, not just a one time thing). The main character is then completely unable to exist as anything except a soldier in later life, and has no qualms about killing a hostage to kill an enemy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He rediscovers his humanity when he is ruthlessly "decommissioned" and accepted by a community of castaways, though he remains a soldier first and foremost.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> has all the townsfolk of Sanford unfazed by all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">grisly deaths</a> going on, treating them all as minor inconveniences.
<ul><li> Part of the reason that Sanford citizens are okay with this is that the typical citizen actually doesn't see it. Most deaths are attributed to accidents by the police and the conspiracy arranges the deaths to look they resulted from foibles of the victim or the environment of the town (a town drunk is killed in a gas stove explosion, which was attributed to his midnight snacking, a overly-dramatic citizen was found in a car wreck after he engaged in multiple attempts to bribe the police to ignore his speeding, and another victim was killed by debris falling from a church tower in dis-repair, while the at a feit to specifically raise funds to repair the church tower). Other victims are just people who disappear without the residents really knowing or missing them. Among the cops, only one is in on the conspiracy, and the rest view him as a good boss who encourages a positive work environment and the only cops who suspect a thing are seen as crazy from the tedium of police work in an idyllic community long before they "leave" the force. Given the number of bodies and the various states of decay when the conspiracy's work is revealed, it's implied that they prefer letting their targets look like they left town instead of sucummbing to accidents. It helps that the cops regularly point out that they haven't had a documented murder in 30 years, so the police won't suspect foul play immediately AND all the members of the conspiracy are upstanding and outgoing members of the community who are rather generous with their efforts to help the greater good.

Then, when she has been convinced to just give a statement of what her job is like (as the suffragettes want to prove that women work just as hard as men) she calmly describes the gruesome deaths of colleagues in work accidents, how the chemicals they have to work with decrease their lifespan, and how they put their babies in baskets under the kettles with boiling water, which their employer thinks is completely okay, as he wants them to return to work early. What she does not tell, but is later revealed is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the man also routinely rapes the young teenaged girls who work for him, and it is implied he did this to Maud, too.</span> The reason why Maud has to tell all those things is that the colleague, who originally offered to speak, has been beaten up by her husband and they fear that the men in power will not listen to a woman who isn't pretty. No one thinks this particularly remarkable, nor does anyone suggest to take the fact she's been beaten up so badly as evidence why women need votes.

It's not unreasonable to assume that they have seen worse, it comes with the job, and there seems to have been a bandit problem for a long time. And her lieutenant points out that unlike Ren, who knew and loved her father, most soldiers are conceived from drugged prisoners in military brothels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, Oreg has been a slave for so long that what would constitute horror to others is his baseline normal. When talking to his master about things that may annoy him, he moves to keep a piece of furniture between them. Ward (who inherited him at the start of the novel) notices this, and concludes that Oreg must be used to people whose reaction to things that annoy them is violence. Ward has some experience with this, as his father (Oreg's former owner) was abusive. Ward, however, refuses to acknowledge this as <em>normal</em>. His brother Tosten, on the other hand, is a bit more sensitive, and when Ward seeks him out for a family reunion, thinks that Ward has come to kill him in order to get him out of the way as potential heir. He accepts this and only asks Ward to make it quick and painless. Ward is horrified when he finally understands what Tosten is talking about.

The nature of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> is such that wide sections of the populations on two continents are culturally inured to such things as widespread rape, bigotry of many kinds from classism to sexism via racism and worse, indentured servitude of various descriptions and hellatious training, working or living conditions.

Its cultural impact spreads widely as a weirdly gruesome form of checks-and-balances, thanks to their strict code of ethics making them... acceptable, if feared. <em>Valar morghulis; valar dohaeris</em> — "all men must die; all men must serve".

There was an episode in which a murder took place on a Native American reservation and the Sheriff was initially a suspect. Gideon ruled him out after watching him give his own take on the crime scene. Like the killer, the sheriff was unfazed by the gruesome scene, but if he <em>were</em> the killer, he would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">feigned disgust</a>.

<ul><li> The most heartbreaking is probably a young mother who was brutally sexually abused by her stepfather. She represses the specific memories, but they've clearly shaped her world view; she refuses to leave her own daughter (who's about the same age she was when the abuse started) alone with an adult male, even when the alternative is leaving the eight-year-old home alone for multiple days straight, because she's convinced any man will rape her daughter if given the chance — in her mind, that's just the way things are, and the only way to protect said daughter is to never put her in that situation. She's also been through a string of abusive relationships, which she sees as normal.
</li><li> In the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">based on the Ariel Castro case</a>, the first girl he kidnapped has become this, to the point where she doesn't immediately see anything wrong with his actions towards her or the other girls.

In some cases, the victim even sees themselves as being in a relationship with the abuser. One former victim, abused at 15 and now pushing 40, is devastated to find that the older man she believed was the love of her life no longer cares about her because she's too old.

When he is finally able to break the conditioning, he then has the difficult task of breaking it on the rest of the slaves to get them to rebel. It remains a factor he has to deal with through the rest of the series, as even after freeing themselves, the ex-slaves mostly have no drive other than to kill all Romans, and getting them to see any other goal is monumentally difficult. Even one of Spartacus' closest friends, Agron, admits privately that he has been a soldier and slave for so long that he cannot imagine a life outside of blood and battle.

<ul><li> It shouldn't surprise anybody that this is a <em>goal</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, what with it being the veritable poster child for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Videogame Cruelty Potential</a>. Unhappy dwarves are prone to fits of violence, and nothing makes a dwarf unhappier than seeing loved ones and treasured pets die. The solution? Drip feed them a steady stream of deaths until they acquire the coveted "doesn't really care about anything anymore" trait. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">All in the name of progress of course</a>!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a></em>, the Tsviets of Deepground are like this. Special mentions go to the team-killing Azul and bloodthirsty Rosso.
</li><li> Summoners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> are like this, raised from a young age to accept that someday, they'll march off to battle an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> named Sin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">die in battle</a></span> to give their world a few years' off from its horrific bombardment and <em>maybe</em> a chance that this time Sin won't return (you know, if humanity has fully repented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight">for ever using technology</a>). (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Everybody besides from the player and the protagonist are aware of this, to them there's no other option: either give the world temporary peace or no peace at all. Yuna, a daughter trying to live up to her father's legacy as a Summoner who defeated Sin, decides to find another way when she learns that not only is a second sacrifice is needed (always someone dear to the Summoner), but the whole Summoner vs. Sin system is an <em>endless</em> cycle which actually provides the means for Sin to return over and over while misleading the people of world with just enough <em>hope</em> to keep them in line</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a>: Stormblood</em> has the territories occupied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Garlean Empire</a>: the fallen nations of Ala Mhigo and Doma. Over two decades of living under the oppressive bootheel of the Empire, combined with failed rebellions, have led to the average citizens accepting that their sad lot in life is all they have to aspire to. The very thought of rebellion is unfathomable; accepting Imperial rule means things can't get any worse, but taking up arms against their conquerors would mean harsh reprisals. The players are thus tasked with helping the Ala Mhigans and Domans build up the confidence needed to shake off the Empire's oppressive yoke and retake their freedom.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> is raised to believe that they are responsible for sacrificing their life to save the world. Some accept this better than others, although it leaves both the ones we see with serious self-esteem issues. Colette believes that her life only has value as long as she can have the strength to become a sacrifice, and is all right with the idea because it will allow her friends to live long and happy lives in a carefree world. Zelos, although he hides it, is far more bitter about the entire system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> not only has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ion</span> go to his death with a smile because he can't grasp that his individual life has any meaning besides what he can do with it, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to stop a war, find a way for Luke to win and save Tear's life</span> and instead of resenting it, he is honestly happy that betraying him and causing his death helped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. While he's an extreme example, the entire population of Auldrant qualifies.
<ul><li> Nephry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaks up with Peony because the scorer said she'd marry someone else,</span> and not only does neither of them fight it, they don't try to renew the relationship even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Score is rejected</span> and they have the option.
</li><li> Luke's own father and uncle are willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">send him to die</span> both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to set off a war they'll win</span> and because the Score says so: it's not until fairly late in the game that they seem to realize that this was a cruel thing to do to Luke and Natalia and it would have been not just ok, but <em>good</em> for them to not want to do it.
</li><li> Grand Maestro Mohs sees nothing wrong with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a genocidal war</span>, since the Score was made to bring prosperity to Auldrant, so it's obviously for the best. While Mohs is hated by fans because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ion's death</span>, he actually doesn't even qualify as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> on Auldrant. His is the <em>moderate</em> faction, containing the normal, sensible members of the Order who just want the best for Auldrant, like Tear. In a different era of Auldrant's history, he'd probably be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality">a good guy</a>, just not when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Score is currently counting down to Auldrant's demise and he's dealing with replicas. Since the Score, written for the benefit of everyone, doesn't regard replicas as worth a mention</span> he's actually fully justified in considering them not people, given the Order's doctrine about Lorelei. He's actually completely right that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Lorelei</a> cares about everyone, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he just overestimated Lorelei's ability to make the Score turn out that way.</span>
</li><li> Almost everyone reacts with shock and horror to the idea of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealing a Score of death</span>, even when, or especially because, doing so would save someone's life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and go against the Score, and since the Score was written to create the most prosperity and happiness for Auldrant's people, obviously Lorelei wouldn't have had them die then if it wasn't for the best.</span>
</li><li> The best example, even more than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Van</span> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. When Luke asks him if he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cares about Luke at all other than as a living weapon</span> he honestly <em>doesn't understand the question</em>, mistaking it for an existential one. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was brought into the world as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykebomb">Laser-Guided Tyke-Bomb</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in accordance with the Score</span> with parents who were aware of this the entire time and only thought about him in terms of that function <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just like how he regards Luke.</span> Oh, and as a babysitter for their 'real' child. The people who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">used him to destroy his homeland and as an excuse for performing deadly experiments on civilians who were going to die anyway</span> considered themselves fully justified, between the Score and using him as a scapegoat. When that's the ethical framework in which he was raised, is it that odd that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">doesn't see anything wrong with creating replicas or destroying Auldrant?</span> After all, it was ok to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hook him into a machine and destroy Hod</span> for the greater good, and he's doing this to allow humanity to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">survive the Scored end of the world.</span> In the context of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Van</span>'s childhood, his interactions with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luke</span> in the early game become a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>. He gives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luke</span> the childhood he wishes he could have had: a comfortable life with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">parental</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">figures</a> who at least seem to love him instead of being constantly told <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thousands will die</span> because he's a monster and subjecting him to brutal experiments. He just can't grasp that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luke</span> feels he has a right to resent what was done to him because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Van himself</span> was repeatedly told that he didn't and internalized the idea.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> for most of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the loyal god-generals</span> was when they ran into a horror that they could <em>not</em> accept. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Largo</span>'s daughter was kidnapped, causing his wife to kill herself and he could not have justice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legretta</span> suddenly fell in love with someone she went after in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> and the knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this was likely Scored</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">makes her skin crawl</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sync</span>, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ion</span> believes that he can't have value other than as a tool and hates this.

All sets of twins in the village know of the ritual and accept it as necessary. Some, like Sae (though not her twin), even look forward to it.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Little Sisters,</span> as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII">Suikoden III</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yun of Alma Kinan</span> is fully aware she's going to be sacrificed as part of a ritual to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> continue hiding the sealed True Water Rune</span>. Though the party that meets her protests this and tries to stop the ceremony, she calmly insists on its necessity, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ritual goes as planned</span>.
</li><li> The initial protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Theresia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Theresia">Theresia: Dear Emile</a></em> was raised by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a>, and displays a lot of sadomasochistic tendencies (sometimes at the same time as more normal reactions.) In particular, she's comforted by the smell of blood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Jack</a> is this trope, full stop. At first she seems to just enjoy killing, but it's not until you do her loyalty mission that you find out she was put into life-or-death combat matches with other biotics as a child. When she won, she got a dose of drugs. As she says, she "still gets a rush" when she kills someone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Javik</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> is this as well, but for different reasons. Having been born when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Reaper War</a> in his cycle had already been well underway has caused him to simply accept war and atrocities as a fact of life. This is explicitly called attention to while talking to him after Sanctuary, if you talk to him before talking to Tali, you hear them have a conversation about what happened at the Cerberus facility being pretty typical in his cycle.
</li></ul></li><li> Heather in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> becomes increasingly inured to the blood and gore all around her as time goes on, but even at the beginning she's surprisingly blase about, for example, finding a roasted dog in in a cafe. Some speculate being raised by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> Harry Mason or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having the memories of torture-magnet Alessa</span> had something to do with it.
<ul><li> However, at the end of the game, she finally gives in to everything she's experienced, most notably finally being able to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grieve the death of her father</span>. She collapses after the final boss and allows herself to cry it all out.
</li><li> Examine Heather's knife in her inventory and she'll comment that she started carrying it for self defense, but now feels comforted and excited by having it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, most of the playable characters are Special Forces qualified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">teenaged mercenaries</a> who've been in training since before they reached puberty. Rinoa, as their client, is shocked and upset to hear Squall tell her - with full agreement from Selphie and Zell - that they will follow her orders no matter how hopeless they think her plans are, even if it gets them killed. Squall, in turn, is confused and frustrated by her reaction; he thinks they're simply being professional.
</li><li> All the inhabitants of Vella's world in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenAge">Broken Age</a></em> (bar Vella herself and her grandfather) find the idea of sacrificing young maidens to a giant monster to be not only acceptable, but to be celebrated. Young girls will go out of their way to be chosen, the villages to dress them up in themed costumes and those not chosen are shamed and their family disgraced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>: Aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> he received from The Boss, on top of what he went through to become a Green Beret, Big Boss's many painful experiences have made him cynical about his flirtation with horror. He's come to accept that he's destined to live in the heat of battle as long as he lives. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>, when Paz asks Big Boss about his thoughts on peace he says flat out that he doesn't know what peace looks like, and in an odd way the battlefield itself brings him a type of peace that "real peace" could never satisfy. By the time he fights Snake in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Zanzibar Land</a>, his stance has become progressively worse as he claims that it's his fate to die bitterly like a dog on the battlefield. He goes so far as to say that nothing else matters to him; not money, not power, not even lust  only war.
</li><li> In the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em>, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">two classes of individuals</a>: Casualries and Luxurors. Between both, there are brutal forms of classism and discrimination (pretty much locking both into their lot in life), and generally a <em>massive</em> gap of influence, wealth, and power. But they believe God decrees the station everyone's meant to hold and can change it anyway with the Gauntlet Rite. However, a certain woman in black called the Black Samurai starts popping up, distributing mysterious books containing political commentary and social theories. These have the effect of breaking the illusion that the gap is necessary or even desirable, maddening the Casualries reading them, and leaving them prime targets for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>...
</li><li> The Phone Guy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> (the worker who sends you messages every night) is <em>unnaturally</em> calm about his job, which is the same as yours: defending yourself from killer robots.
</li><li> One of the major themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> is just how endemic this trope is to contemporary Japanese society, as people would rather keep their heads down and ignore corruption and abuse from those in power. As such, the game has quite a few examples:
<ul><li> The Shujin Academy volleyball teams (and honestly, the entire school) are so used to Kamoshida owning the place that they're in complete denial about his physical abuse of the students. They call it "training". While not everyone was in the know, the principal and enough of the parents were more than willing to hush everything up so that Kamoshida could keep bringing glory to the school.
</li><li> Madarame also conditioned his pupils - particularly Yusuke, who he'd taken in as a foster son - to accept his plagiarism of their work, framing it as them "lending him their ideas". Yusuke had put up with the plagiarism and implied neglect for so many years that, despite secretly wanting to leave Madarame's care (while feeling that he couldn't), he denies all of the abuse when confronted by the party about it and emphasizes that he owes Madarame for taking him in. Finally accepting that Madarame is a criminal is what pushes Yusuke to awaken his Persona and become a phantom thief. Lampshaded later, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haru</span> wonders how the workers at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Okumura Foods</span> could accept their treatment, with Yusuke describing how people, when oppressed, can welcome said oppression after a while.
</li><li> In an example approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">Gallows Humor</a>, if you let the deadline for Kaneshiro's Palace get too close, Makoto will remind you to get it done ASAP, mentioning that Kaneshiro has been sending her his own "friendly reminders" via texts. When asked if she's okay, she will reply that she's gotten used to it.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yaldabaoth, can be seen as an embodiment of this trope. As a manifestation of humanity's subconscious desire for order, he has secretly been manipulating everyone to create a version of reality where nobody thinks for themselves, instead blindly following the status quo without any regard for the individuals that get ground up or tossed aside to maintain it. This gets taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> at the end of the game, when he manages to merge the twisted labyrinth of Mementos with the real world; only the protagonist and the allies he's made along the way notice that anything's off until Yaldabaoth's minions start falling.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Fitting as a <em>Persona 5</em> spinoff, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth">Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth</a></em> plays with this as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagi, or more accurately Enlil, curates a complex of theaters in the collective unconsious that draw hapless souls of people being torn and denied by the very fabric of society into them and only display negative memories of people turning into emotional wrecks with all positive things from them cut out, portraying them as failures and living garbage, with the main OC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Hikari</a> being one of those wards that are convinced that being unique is worthless and ended up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia">Trauma-Induced Amnesia</a> as a result.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in regards to Camilla. Out of all the Nohrian siblings, she's widely seen as the most well-adjusted to death and violence, switching between battlefields and home-life with striking ease. However, Camilla actually seems a bit less well-adjusted to such things than Leo is, given that she expresses unease with Keaton's collection of human bones from a burial ground, whereas Leo seems to be very much at ease with graves, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if his choosing one as a battlefield in <em>Birthright</em> is any indication</span>. She also isn't entirely beyond being stunned, given the shock she expressed at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how brutally Hans executed Scarlet off-screen in <em>Conquest</em></span>.
</li><li> Leo is even more of this trope; unlike Camilla, he has no qualms against executing his enemies in cold blood, rather than in the heat of battle. Also, while Camilla <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is creeped out by the fact that Keaton stole human bones from a burial ground for his collection</span>, Leo is perfectly fine spending time in burial grounds, even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">choosing one as a battleground in <em>Birthright</em></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a> Path of Fire</em> has the current state of the Elonian people. Their nations were enslaved centuries ago by the lich Palawa Joko who now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNecrocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNecrocracy">rules them as a god-emperor</a>. The humans are allowed to live mainly to provide a constant supply of fresh bodies for Joko's army, but they have been so heavily indoctrinated that they worship Joko as a god and consider being raised into undeath as a great honor.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw">Milo Murphy's Law</a>:</em> the title character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">Born Unlucky</a>, and has come to cheerfully accept the weird and dangerous things that are going to happen to him every day. His family and friends also fall into this trope, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx">having to cope with every disaster alongside him</a>. This is most evident in Zack, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalLatecomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalLatecomer">Logical Latecomer</a> who becomes Milo's friend in the first episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Zack:</strong> AAAGGGHHH—wait, why aren't <em>you</em> screaming?! <br/><strong>Milo:</strong> I find it doesn't help. Just hurts the larynx.
</div></li><li> Though it's an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> to us, can we take a moment to consider how society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> got to the point where suicide is so widespread that they even found a way to capitalize on it with Suicide Booths and that no-one in the setting calls attention to them?
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a></em> the population of Dreamland is disturbingly indifferent to the widespread plague in their city. The "Plague Patrol" that picks up corpses to be dumped in a pit and burned is treated as just another worker on the streets. Bunty even cheerfully talks about cleaning up one of her children before having him thrown in the pit, along with his little friends.
</li><li> Most veteran adventurers, villains, and henchmen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros">The Venture Bros.</a></em> are generally unphased by horrible death and dismemberment, shrugging it off as little more than an occupational hazard.
</li><li> The citizens of Apokolips in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> have been so thoroughly crushed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>'s tyranny that when Superman defeats him and tells them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWithHimAsYouWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWithHimAsYouWill">Do with Him as You Will</a>, they immediately rush to Darkseid's side to help him get medical treatment rather than comprehend life without him.
</li><li> In the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, the Daughters of Aku have been raised and trained from birth to hold the Samurais death more important than anything else, including their own and each others lives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>: The original version of Harley Quinn seems to have a case of this (mixed with a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>), as she even has a musical number in one episode where she talks about the various ways the Joker abuses her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">how she can't bring herself to leave him so has decided to just put up with it.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, every parent in town except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Sharon Marsh</a> regarding school shootings.

<ul><li> As a general rule, this can apply to anything from an abusive childhood to residents in a war-torn area dealing with bombings. Not accepting it in this manner would likely lead to some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>.
</li><li> One day, you will cease existing. You will never experience anything ever again. People who care about you will cry, and then stop crying, and then one day go through the same thing. You've known about this since childhood. You probably don't think about it very often.
</li><li> Professionals as well rely on this as a coping mechanism. Soldiers, police officers, paramedics, firefighters, you name it, often fall into this either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">jokingly evoking it</a> to poke fun at crappy taskings or exercises, or seriously relying on it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">deal with actual horrors they experience</a>.
</li><li> From the 17th to the 19th century, sailors that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressGanged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressGanged">Press-Ganged</a> or willingly accepted a position aboard a slave ship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob">out of sheer need,</a> reported that on their first voyage to Africa, they felt incredibly guilty over the fact that they were being forced to chain up and cram as many horrified people into the cargo hold as possible, watch as the higher ranking crewmen beat the captives mercilessly or raped them. However, as the voyage went on, the new sailors began to accept that capturing people and selling them as cattle was just another part of the job, and didn't even flinch when the captives were severely flogged by their superiors, or when they did it themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier">Some even joined in future enslaving expeditions</a>.
</li><li> There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">quite a few horrific things that our ancestors did</a> that most people at the time just accepted as "the way it is" (be it slavery, public executions, burning people at the stake etc). Thankfully many of those things have either been abolished or at least made morally unacceptable enough that they are illegal in most places. It's also highly likely that our descendants will regard some things <em>we</em> consider normal and acceptable with the same degree of visceral horror most people today have for things like slavery or burning people alive.
