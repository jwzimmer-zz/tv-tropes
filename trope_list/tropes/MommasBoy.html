His mother might try to completely dominate his life, to the point of telling him who to marry (and if he disobeys then she'll try to ruin his relationship or at least ruin her life too), turning him into a Momma's Boy: hopeless with women, timid, weak, and lacking the spirit to stand up to his mother. His father will be absent or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">just as browbeaten</a>.

</p><p>Young examples are shown sympathetically; older ones are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a> because no one can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">a badass</a> if he always obeys his mother's instructions (unless she's encouraging him to be a badass, which would make her more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">Action Mom</a>). Note the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in this trope, as a girl with a controlling father is almost never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.

Sometimes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a> is involved. Rescue is unlikely: there aren't many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> running around looking for poor oppressed boys. So there's the real danger that Momma's boy will grow old alone, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">smother</a> dies, when it's too late to change their ways and set right what went wrong.
</p><p>To every Momma's Boy there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Boy's Momma</a>, of course.
</p><p>Although the trope is usually played as inherently negative, it can also be portrayed in a more positive light, becoming essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender-inversion</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a> in which mother and son are simply very close and utterly adore each other, often to the exclusion of the father (if he's even around to begin with); and while the well-meaning mother might naturally welcome the idea of her son getting hooked, the usual doting and spoiling with which she treats her son might be a bit overwhelming for potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interests</a>... if she didn't accidentally scare them off with her overprotectiveness first. This form is still likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, but in a more endearing way.

For instance, in Anglophone countries where individuality is highly valued, the trope is more likely to be negative, but in Asian and Latin American cultures where living with parents until (and even after) marriage is normal, that kind of devotion to one's parents is more likely to be seen positively.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, Goten is 22 and still lives with Mom, while Gohan is pushing thirty and lives right next-door with his wife and daughter.

To be fair, even a non-Momma's Boy would flip if their mother was in mortal danger.
</li><li> A quite weird case is shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Conan and the detective kids actually find a "haunted house" where a mother keeps her son locked in the basement to wait until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuteOfLimitations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuteOfLimitations">Statute of Limitations</a> past, even when the guy <em>is</em> guilty and <em>does</em> want to go to jail for his crime.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Edward and Alphonse Elric both dearly loved their mother Trisha, so much that they didn't want to accept her death and attempted to revive her.
</li><li> Wrath from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 adaptation</a> is a villainous example. He is Izumi's still-born son and thus has deep mother issues once he regains his memories. He thinks she abandoned him and hates her for it.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">deleted scene</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em> had a scene where he meets up with her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">right when she dies.</span>.

<ul><li> Joseph Joestar acts like this towards his grandmother Erina, while he's a jerk to everyone else he's fiercely loyal to and caring to his granny, Joseph has beat men up for ruining a coat Erina gave him and punched a man who had distressed Erina with grim news. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ironically Joseph isn't nearly as much a Momma's Boy to his actual mother Lisa Lisa (thanks to not knowing <em>she was</em> his mom) though Joseph still likes Lisa Lisa greatly... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeepingTom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeepingTom">perhaps too much</a>.</span>
</li><li> Jotaro is even more of a delinquent than his grandfather Joseph was but nevertheless, Jotaro still loves his mother Holy greatly and goes on a journey to Egypt to stop DIO's in order to save her when she becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a>.

</li><li> In what must be a running theme, Josuke is also very close to his mother Tomoko and his anger towards his illegitimate father Joseph stems from the neglect Joseph gave his mother after he was born.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism">Greece</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> remains devoted to the memory of his mother long after her death, working to excavate the ruins and pass on the myths she left behind. This is not portrayed negatively (his mother <em>was</em> the great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Greece</a>, after all) and while some fanfics have his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis">Sitcom Archnemesis</a> Turkey mock him with this trope, it's usually presented as just a petty insult and Greece's relationship with his mother is usually portrayed positively/sympathetically in them.
</li><li> Sometimes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu">Haré+Guu</a></em>; even though Haré often gets fed up with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> mother, he is still quite devoted.
</li><li> Wallace in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> movie is shown to be this, calling his mother several times during the course of the movie. Daisuke chides him for this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeRangeChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeRangeChildren">although from a realistic standpoint . . . .</a>
</li><li> Takashi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nicoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nicoichi">Nicoichi</a></em> is extremely attached to his mother such that when she passed away in a traffic accident when he was two, he kept on clamoring for her without knowing she could never return, forcing his new guardian (and protagonist of the series) to assume the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">role of a mother</a> and kickstarting the plot.

Yes, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">that</a></strong> Ichigo. Back then, he used to be a major crybaby, but whenever his mom appeared he would stop and would immediately smile. She was the center of not only his world, but his family as well.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> has zig-zagged this over the years:
<ul><li> Initially, Bruce Wayne was depicted as loving both parents and missing them equally after they were gunned down, without particularly favoring one over the other. In the wake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, however, Thomas Wayne became the predominant parent figure, to the point where many of Bruce's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologues</a> are half-delusional conversations with Thomas' ghost. <em>Year One</em> being a massive trendsetter in the industry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">subsequent authors</a> took it to the point where, as one reviewer put it, "Bruce's thoughts are so daddy daddy daddy-centric it's easy to forget he even had a mother attached to that precious string of pearls."
</li><li> Since then, however, other authors have tried to swing the pendulum back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s "Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?"</span>, for one, portrays Martha's spirit as the one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">appears to comfort Bruce</a> when he (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">possibly</a>) dies, and tell him that his reward for being Batman is of course: Being Batman again (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection">cue resurrection</a>).
</li><li> Inverte in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, when Bruce is killed in the alley instead of his parents, and Martha goes insane with grief and becomes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a></em> of this alternate universe. Thomas (who is the AU Batman) gives her hope saying that Bruce is alive and "well" in another world but when she unfortunately asks what he's like and Thomas informs her that Bruce turns out like him, Martha commits suicide in horror.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the ultimate example in comics is Peter Parker alias <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, although to be pedantic he really is an Auntie's Boy. But when he's mother "comes back" he is overjoyed and trusts her and his father with his identity as Spider-Man. Unfortunately (and inevitably), it turns out they were not his parents at all, but robots built by the Chameleon. That said, his robot mother truly believed she was Mary Parker and fought against her robotic husband to protect Peter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> Barry Allen is certainly an example of this trope.
</li><li> Steve Rogers aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> loved his mother Sarah Rogers deeply as she's the one who gave him his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> nature in face of her alcoholic and abusive husband Joseph, Steve's greatest shame is that he was unable to protect and save Sarah from the pain she went through.
</li><li> In a similar vein to Cap, Bruce Banner aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheHulk">The Hulk</a> was this to his mother Rebecca due to Brian Banner being a psychotic abusive asshole as while Brian hated his son, Rebecca adored Bruce and lost her life protecting him from Brian. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheCenterOfTheMind">Battle in the Center of the Mind</a> Rebecca again tries defend her son but Bruce being the goddamn Hulk <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/2ebdSTF.png">assures his dear mom that nothing can hurt him now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> Tony Stark aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">the same boat</a> as Cap and Hulk, as while his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> adoptive father</span> Howard treated him harshly and put heavy expectations on him, Maria conversely adored Tony and often protected him from Howard's abuse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Tony meets his actual mother Amanda, he accepts her immediately and hugs her</span>.

Hell, he'll even lie to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hermione, her biological daughter</span> for her - though he makes it clear that while he understands the logic behind her choice/why he has to lie, he is <em>not</em> happy about it.

This is portrayed in a very positive light and doesn't detract from his badassness at all, as she raised him single-handedly after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">dad left</a> and the first book has him protecting her from his abusive stepfather.

<ul><li> It includes hurling himself at his mother when he became frightened (or when he feels horribly displaced or 'obscene'), followed by a very vague implied comfort-nursing. Since Grendel is recalling it in first-person, he <em>remembers</em> this.

</li></ul></li><li> In his adult life, he drifts from being a Mama's Boy a little, despising his mother's apparently inability to speak or desire to leave their cave. And yet he always returns to her, with Mama trying to keep him from leaving her until he actually picks her up and puts her aside. Literally and figuratively. She didn't react well to "being put aside" and never tries to stop him from leaving again. Which is where Beowulf later kills him.

<ul><li> In the outright creepy corner, we have Robert "Sweetrobin" Arryn and his Epic-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a> Lysa—this pair manage one of the most horrible takes on the trope you'd ever hope not to meet—the poor boy is so smothered, his <em>physical</em> health is directly impacted, not just his mental.
</li><li> In the mixed-bag section, we have Cersei Lannister and her two boys.

</li><li> For more marginal examples, there are Brandon Stark and Samwell Tarly. Deliberate it wasn't in either case, but they're both their mothers' darlings. Thankfully, they are among the most lightly smothered you'll find still kind of meeting this trope.

He is devoted to his mother as a human (and it's his first defining relationship), and turns her into a vampire after Drusilla turns him because she was dying of tuberculosis.

Over the age of thirty, and he still lives with his mother and does as she demands. Several episodes have creepy oedipal overtones to the mix at the very least (suggestions that Cliff was breastfed past infancy, and some kind of roleplaying game to help Cliff get to sleep), and the relationship being horrifically co-dependent (Cliff mentions at one point they've both faked heart attacks during arguments).

<ul><li> One of the frontrunners for firefighter Michael was Erica Ellyson, the 2008 <em>Penthouse</em> Pet of the Year. Erica was terrified to tell Michael and his mother, Lorraine, about this fact, but she eventually came clean to both. Ironically, Michael was the one who expressed doubt as to whether or not he should ultimately choose Erica, while Lorraine actually encouraged him to choose her ("I have a choice between a doctor and a <em>Penthouse</em> Pet... and my mom wants me to choose the <em>Penthouse</em> Pet!"). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Michael ended up not choosing Erica, but Erica and Lorraine had become close in spite of this.

Though she did not explicitly mention Camilla's race, Esther strongly hinted her disapproval of such by telling Rob, "Think of what the Passover table will look like," when trying to press him to choose a girl named Lauren.

</li><li> Khalood, mother of hockey player Jojo, famously insisted that her potential daughter-in-law not be black, Asian, Latino, "fat butt," Jewish, and so forth; Khalood wanted a girl who was "white, petite, and do what I tell her to." Her litany upset many of the girls, and created tension between them and her. When Jojo went out on a date with African-American Misty, Khalood demanded that the producers fly her via helicopter so that she could spy on them. Upon seeing Jojo and Misty in a hot tub embracing, Khalood became enraged. When the time came for the mothers to choose between two girls for one of their sons' two final dates (their sons would choose a different girl for the other final date), Khalood decided to deny both girls the final date and punctuated her decision by ripping up the plane ticket that was meant for whoever she had chosen.

</div></li><li> General <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s mother always told him he had to grow up to be as great as his father, Arthur MacArthur, Jr. (Lieutenant General, and military governor of the Philippines for a time). Also, while he was a bachelor, he kept a mistress in a hotel, unbeknownst to his mother.
<ul><li> He had a second reason for this: his mistress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">was 34 years younger than him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> was like this too. One example: when he was in his 60s, he was offered some wine, and his mother said, "The boy doesn't drink wine." He had become blind at that time, if you wonder why his mother still had to care for him.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeGyllenhaal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeGyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> appears to be this, if one of his interviews with Jimmy Kimmel is any indication. He told a very lengthy anecdote about her getting him a present, describing her as a "badass chick" for her sheer persistence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> wrestler Buff Bagwell and his mother, Judy, who was made one-half of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wcw/wcw-t.html">WCW World Tag Team Champions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1998 with Rick Steiner. Both Buff and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kanyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kanyon">Kanyon</a> would fight in a "Judy Bagwell on a <strike>Pole</strike> Forklift" match in 2000. It was also rumored that Bagwell was fired from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> in 2001 because Judy was calling the WWF offices to complain about Buff's travel schedule. However, it was also likely due to his notorious stinker of a match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a> on the July 2 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">Raw</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> adored his mother Katherine, and apparently so did everyone else according to his memorial ("Mrs. Jackson... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and Joe</a>"). One of the first things Michael did when he became a successful solo artist was to throw a big birthday party for her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgainstMyReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgainstMyReligion">which nearly backfired horribly because she is a devout Jehovah's Witness</a> (they compromised by having all the gifts "wrapped" in plain brown bags).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JavierBardem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JavierBardem">Javier Bardem</a>; he notably dedicated his Oscar win for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen">No Country for Old Men</a></em> to his mother (In Spanish, no less), and cites her career as an actress as his inspiration for becoming an actor himself.
</li><li> Former World Heavyweight Boxing Champ Lennox Lewis' autobigraphy was even entitled "Mommas Boy". Not that I would call him on it or anything.
</li><li> The Roman Emperor Severus Alexander, who was only fourteen when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing">his mother arranged for him to come to power</a>. She was known as 'Mother of Augustus, and of the camps, and of the senate, and of the Fatherland', in case anyone was in any doubt about who was really in charge. Eventually, they were both murdered.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> made a promise to <em>both</em> his parents that he would take care of them once he made it big, and he kept that promise, even bringing them to live at Graceland. Their graves are there, right beside his.
<div class="indent"><strong>Johnny Cash</strong>: (Elvis Presley) was a kid when I worked with him. He was nineteen years old, and he loved cheeseburgers, girls, and his mother, not necessarily in that order (it was more like his mother, then girls, then cheeseburgers).
</div></li><li> German author Erich Kästner (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LottieAndLisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LottieAndLisa">Lottie and Lisa</a></em>) was this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and also wrote many characters like this in his books.
</li><li> Ronnie and Reggie Kray were notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonGangster">London Gangsters</a>, "but they loved their mum". Allegedly their favourite song was the ultimate tribute to mothers, "My Yiddishe Momme."
</li><li> NFL receiver Andre Johnson, after being goaded into a fistfight with opposing cornerback Cortland Finnegan, was later asked in an interview what his mother thought about it. He responded that he'd rather not say what his 'Momma' said about him fighting.
<ul><li> Speaking of NFL players, the very first thing that linebacker Ray Lewis, considered one of the game's toughest, most physical players, bought after he got his first contract? An apartment in the city he moved to play in for his mom, down the hall from his apartment. The two still have a close relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> Russian NHL winger and current super star Alexander Ovechkin is an admitted Momma's Boy. He is single and often stays with his parents, while his mother cooks and washes for him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> is one both in- and out-of-character. He's the youngest of eleven children and his mom had to raise him alone for much of his childhood because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">his father (and two of his brothers) were killed when he was a boy</a>. Stephen has done several tributes to her on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>, often in response to her health issues (and ultimately her death at age 92 in June 2013).
</li><li> In the wild, killer whales stay with their mothers for her whole life, but males get especially attached to their mommas. A male orca won't usually live very long after his mother dies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> is a self-confessed mama's boy. His mother actually came up with the band name for *NSYNC, attended events with him as a chaperon, and he has her initials tattooed on his back.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheMarxBrothers">The Marx Brothers</a> were all devoted to their mother Minnie, who had managed them early in their career. Chico, Harpo, and Groucho all named their daughters Minnie in her honor.
</li><li> Bodybuiler Søren Falby responded to a meme by saying that his mother would kill him if she ever found out that he slapped a woman. Then proceeded to make a long post honoring her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> is very close with both of his parents, as they almost always appear in TV interviews with him. He even took his mother as his date to the Tony's rather than his wife, who was presumably alright with this.
