Earlier, apparently, youkai in this fic keep pets (or their equivalent) but they find the thought of keeping a human as a pet to be weird.

However, sex is not taboo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Some writers have taken this to mean </a> that if you're a Jedi, you can have all the sex you want, but you can't have a fully meaningful relationship with any of your partners.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, it doesn't just extend to romantic attachments, either; having any sort of strong emotional connection to <em>anyone</em> seems to be at least slightly frowned upon. However, actual enforcement seems to have been rather intermittent, which is probably for the best from a writing standpoint. Luke quite sensibly ditches the rule completely when he recreates the Order, after seeing what it did to his father. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08q19');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08q19" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08q19');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The policy seems to vary with the era; in Exar Kun's War (4000 years prior to the films), no-one batted an eyelash at married Jedi and Jedi with families. By the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> era (about a generation later), the ban is in place, though not well enforced.

After the Battle of Ruusan, the Order not only banned "attachments" of all kinds but only accepted initiates from infancy. Of course, there were splinter sects like the Green Jedi of Corellia and the Altisian Jedi who didn't follow these rules.</span> The fact that it was introduced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">after</a> Luke was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsUnion">married</a> in the EU, probably had something to do with it.

It's especially irritating as Gogol warned her about all this before the meeting, only for her to completely disregard it. She dooms the relationship by showing up at Ashoke's funeral in a black (everyone else is clad in white), sleeveless dress.

<ul><li> In the alternate England in the <em>Slave World</em> novels, it's considered perverted and socially unacceptable to have sex as equals. Sex is supposed to be between an aristocrat and a slave who has legally been deprived of basic human rights. And the sex slave <em>has</em> to be tied up or similar; to have sex with an unrestrained person is also considered perverse.

</li><li> The Solarians have a wider taboo forbidding physical presence of another human in the same room for all but the most utterly necessary occasions. They feel disgusted by breathing the air which just went through someone else's lungs. Compare it to our disgust at drinking water from a brook someone has just urinated into in our presence.

To Aiel, nakedness is not taboo, they use co-ed sweat tents as a fill-in for showers in their desert homeland—Wetlanders find this scandalous. And this trope occurs for both sides—to Aiel displaying affection in public is taboo. Kissing your spouse with others watching would apparently be viewed similar to how a Wetlander might view having sex with them in public.

<ul><li> The people of the planet O would never marry just one other person. Their marriage arrangement, called a <em>sedoretu</em>, involves four people, two women and two men, and both heterosexual and homosexual relations are expected. What's more, if you're a member of a sedoretu, there is always one other member whom you may <em>not</em> have sex with. That's because everyone on the planet belongs to one of two moieties, with moiety membership inherited from one's mother, and there is a strict taboo against having sex with anyone in the same moiety as you. A sedoretu contains two people from each moiety, so you have two spouses you can have sex with (one male, one female) but having sex with your third spouse is considered just <em>wrong</em>. No-one in any of the O stories is even tempted to do it. "Mountain Ways," one of the O stories, makes it clear that everyone is supposed to be bisexual. It's considered odd and shameful for someone to only like one gender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em>, the entire story takes place on Gethen, an isolated planet. The near-humans there naturally shift from male to intersex to female to back in seemingly-monthly cycles. A small proportion of the population does <em>not</em> shift and are called "perverts". A human from Earth travels there, trying to establish a diplomatic connection with the rest of humanity; his mission is complicated because they all consider him a "pervert". One character, in an attempt to seduce another, used hormones to shift his/her cycle timing and ensure his/her gender is the opposite of the target's. The target's reaction shows they think the attempted seducer is also a pervert, though the word is not used there.

<ul><li> For the record, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for a <em>very</em> small minority of Christians.

When one character is asked to help translate this for a Mud Person smitten with someone from another land, the translator instructs him that he should instead compliment things that aren't covered by clothes.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce">Spaceforce</a></em> series, the culture of the Taysan Empire is very keen on chastity and in particular, has strict rules about who can marry whom and how. Marriage is only legal between people of the same 'degree' (social class, effectively), and only after a lengthy, highly ritualized courtship. Liaisons outside these boundaries are a criminal offence and punishable by causing the offender to be 'outcaste', which usually results in death. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality">asexuality</a> of all things is considered a disgusting perversion.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series, deep dwarf culture has a whole bunch of taboos (their sages, the grags, often find the mere idea of seeing sunlight repulsive) but even modern dwarfs are opposed to dwarf women expressing their femininity. Not just dressing for it, but unnecessarily admitting to having a gender identity differing from the default "probably male" (dwarf courtship consists mainly of very tactfully discerning if the object of your affection is of a compatible gender). Lately the dwarfs have undergone a sexual revolution of sorts, matching their chainmail with leather skirts, putting high heels on their iron boots, braiding their beards, and even making attempts at makeup.
<ul><li> The more traditional Dwarfs also consider writing of all kinds to be sacred (they believe their creator wrote the universe into existence), and the destruction of words to be a crime. When Vimes reveals that he was "blackboard monitor" at school and responsible for erasing the lesson at the end of class, he is met with some shock. Though the Low King of the dwarfs actually winds up using "Blackboard Monitor Vimes" as a respectful title, claiming that the duty must have been a great responsibility.
</li><li> Trolls punch and throw rocks at each other as a friendly greeting (or, if it's a pretty rock, a romantic overture), and don't always remember there are good reasons not to do this to the squishy races. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> a bit of flirting between Troll soldiers serving with different sides during peace negotiations almost reignited the war.

One of the characters travels to a number of different countries in the first book and is treated to a variety of very open opinions on the topic: in one nation, everyone is pretty okay with it; in another nation, people mostly try to pretend it doesn't happen; in another nation, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">severe social stigma</a> and potential legal ramifications attached to it; in another country, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">execute anyone caught</a> in any homosexual behavior. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is all pretty patent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> that this character is himself gay.</span>

Men and women do different jobs, don't normally socialize, and don't form romantic partnerships. The only acceptable heterosexual sex is a short-term formal arrangement intended for reproduction. In respectable society, all long-term romantic partnerships are between individuals of the same gender.

<ul><li> Vorinism (the main religion of a number of cultures on Roshar, including the Alethi) is full of this. Its extremely rigid gender roles mean that men aren't allowed to be literate and women are forbidden from fighting. Jobs and even <em>food</em> are gender-segregated, while its taboo against telling the future forbids even guessing what's going to happen, meaning that gambling is limited to games based on hidden information, and people are deeply suspicious of weather forecasters (who also happen to be predominantly male, which, since women are expected to be the scholarly sex, makes it even worse).
<ul><li> Vorin culture holds that women have a "freehand" (right) and a "safehand" (left), and exposing the safehand is compared to going topless. Women of high birth basically aren't supposed to use it at all and keep it hidden in a sleeve, while common women wear a glove over it. Several non-Vorin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> the absurdity of the taboo.
</li><li> When the staid, genteel Highlord Dalinar is reminded of the time he tasted his sister-in-law's food — and <em>liked it!</em> — he's as embarrassed as if he'd been caught trying on her underwear.
</li><li> Also, like some real-world cultures, they consider in-laws to be blood relatives. When Dalinar's Brother's widow starts expressing interest in him, he acts as though they are actually related.
</li></ul></li><li> Shin culture has a strong taboo against walking on stone, which, as Shinovar is the only region on the planet with soil, is rather awkward for Shin traveling outside their homeland. In addition, simply picking up a weapon in Shinovar is grounds for being put into slavery.

They also somewhat more understandably had an issue with the human habit of baring one's teeth in obvious displays of aggression, a.k.a. smiling...
</li><li> In the country of Adara in Gail Dayton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneRoseTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneRoseTrilogy">One Rose Trilogy</a></em>, people marry into groups called "Ilians", which consist of no fewer than four (and no more than twelve) partners of any combination of sexes. The main character just can't figure out why a member of her Ilian from another country is so insecure and jealous until he explains the concept of monogamy. Earlier in the series, the protagonist herself had considered marrying another character, then rejected the idea because they had no one else to join them, and what kind of half-formed Ilian would <em>that</em> be?
</li><li> In Heinlein's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> there are a bunch of different varieties of marriage, but pretty much all of them involve multiple people due to the skewed gender ratio and general living conditions on the Moon. One of the main characters is arrested for polygamy while visiting Earth, but it's revealed that the polygamy might actually have been overlooked by the judge who issued the warrant if it hadn't been for the racial diversity shown in a picture of his family. However, it's also noted that not all of Earth is so judgmental, and this was actually a deliberate ploy to gain sympathy from the less prejudiced Earthlings.
<ul><li> Luna culture is also almost reversed from that of Earth in terms of sexism, again due to the gender ratio. Property within a marriage is almost always held in the women's name(s), and a man can't get divorced unless all of his wives agree. Outside of marriage, any aggression or abuse towards a woman is grounds for being thrown out of the nearest airlock, even for minor infractions that would be considered hardly worth a mention on Earth today, let alone when the book was written.

She's nearly arrested for talking about sexual dimorphism.
</li><li> This is a large part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandCultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandCultures">Thousand Cultures</a> series, as every conceivable ethnic, religious, ideological and utopian concept culture get their own space colony, and <em>then</em> humanity figures out instantaneous interstellar transport via the springer, forcing all these disparate cultures to have to deal with each other after centuries of isolation. At one point, we see a group scorned as "starvers" because they practice agriculture as part of their traditions, despite food replicators existing, and sometimes due to poverty or a bad harvest, people do go hungry.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em>, monogamy is no longer mainstream, at least in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica">USNA</a>. It's still practiced on the Periphery (the flooded remains of coastal American cities), as two is seen as the optimal number for survival in such an environment. However, in the arcologies, it's standard to join a "sex circle" instead. Expecting your current sexual partner to be exclusive is also frowned upon. When Trevor Grey (who grew up on the Periphery) is forced to enlist in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a>, the others alternative refer to him as Prim (short for "primitive", since he mistrusts nanotech) and Monogie (since he prefers monogamy) in a derogatory manner. He does, eventually, learn that having multiple partners isn't necessarily a bad thing, but, after 20-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, he still hasn't quite gotten used to it and prefers to be a serial monogamist instead.

The Marettans are known for a cultural quirk, where they consider eating to be a repulsive and shameful (but, of course, necessary) act akin to defecation. As such, one never eats in front of others. A son typically serves his father the food and makes sure to stand behind him in order to avoid seeing the repulsive act. Only after the father is done, the son is allowed to clean up and eat any remains. Within the walls of his palace, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a> can pick and choose whichers laws he likes from among the planets in his empire.

<ul><li> In an early episode, Riker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">falls in love</a> with an alien from a species of androgynous hermaphrodites. This turns out to be taboo, not because he's human, but because he's male and she self-identifies as female. The whole thing is a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> allegory for homosexuality; several writers and cast members felt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">it would have been braver</a> to have the "androgynous" alien played by a man rather than a woman, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> won out.
</li><li> Another early episode, "Coming of Age," finds Wesley testing for admittance to Starfleet Academy. He encounters a "pop quiz" where he encounters a Zaldan. But he knows enough to answer the Zaldan's accusations with hostility, which actually calms him down. This is because Zaldans believe in laying one's emotions bare; they view courtesy as a facade and consider it insulting.
<ul><li> The Tellarites are the same way. They are often abrasive and insulting. Courtesy is viewed as dishonest and an attempt to conceal something. But if you start insulting them back, they will immediately like you and even offer you a drink.
</li></ul></li><li> The very first encounter with the Ferengi in <em>TNG</em> reveals that they find females wearing clothes repulsive (or hell, doing anything that would make them anything much more than property). By the time it gets to <em>DS9</em>, while a good number of them do harbor these attitudes, most of the ones that handle matters off-Ferenginar have enough business savvy to keep it to themselves (not many Alpha Quadrant species/powers that we've seen share or tolerate this attitude to such a degree, <em>especially</em> the ones with more villainous tendencies...). It seems some of them secretly don't really mind some aspects of this so much, though, and later in <em>DS9</em> more progressive minds among the Ferengi begin to give it a serious questioning.
<ul><li> Part of their repulsion to clothed women is yet another case of this trope. Until very late in the overall timeline of the series (somewhere between DS9 and Voyager), Ferengi women were considered property, and clothing them made it look like you were hiding something. Women weren't allowed to run a business, own property, or even make purchases on their male relatives' behalf. For the most part, they weren't supposed to leave the house.
</li><li> Gets a hilarious gag in one <em>DS9</em> episode where Quark and Rom return home to deal with their mother, who is quite the feminist. They find her in her house, clothed, and react as one would expect any human coming home to find their elderly mother naked.
</li><li> In Ferengi Culture, Marriage isn't tied to procreation. A child is conceived with a contract and the womb is seen as a rental by the father.
</li><li> Ferengi also can be baffled by the fact that most other societies aren't impressed by financial conquests, which they liken to military conquests. Most of the rest of the Galaxy is a post-scarcity society, but the concept of scarcity is a deeply sacred part of Ferengi Culture. And while most cultures do have some concept of money, most really do not care much about it. (Case in point, Klingons still have currency trade for goods and services, but they view using economics to ruin a rival to be underhanded and dishonorable. The accusation of such resulted in one offender being outcast from Klingon Culture. Using economics to buy military might to ruin a rival is much more preferable.)
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons that the Original Series Klingon/Romulan alliance fell apart was because, while both were warrior based cultures, the Klingons viewed the Romulans as arrogant and chronic violators of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilHasStandards">Evil Has Standards</a>, whereas Romulans felt that Klingons had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> to a fault and were backwards. The Human/Klingon Alliance formed out of the Klingon-Romulan conflict when the Klingons realized that humans may not have the same rules as they did, but they at least <em>had</em> rules, which was better than Romulans.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, Trill marriages are "until death do us part" — only this is in a society where Joined Trill carry memories from the lives of multiple people by way of a symbiont (and it's the host's death, not the symbiont's, that ends the marriage). And it's not just that the previous host's marriage isn't binding on the new host (which <em>would</em> make sense); Joined Trill are <em>expressly prohibited</em> from resuming a past host's relationship <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ssmk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ssmk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ssmk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this seems to apply only when both individuals are Trill, or possibly even when they're Joined Trill; other humanoid species are an apparent exception</span>. Jadzia falls prey to this in one episode, falling head over heels in love with another Joined Trill whose past host was married to her past host. Nobody even notices that they are of the same gender, suggesting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">homosexuality is no longer taboo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture">in the future</a> — the ethical/cultural problem is all about them having been husband and wife in a previous life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explained the reasoning for this: if pairs where both partners were joined Trill could continue relationships across multiple host iterations, it would develop into an entrenched aristocratic class of symbiont families.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> confirms the "no longer taboo" part, as it has a stable homosexual couple as major characters (both played by openly gay actors). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And while one of them is killed halfway through the first season, this isn't shown as any less tragic than if a heterosexual character was killed, and his partner's grief is palpable.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In yet another Star Trek example, this time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>, the B-plot of one episode had delegates of a newly encountered alien race being offended after being given a tour of <em>Enterprise</em>, storming off after ten minutes. It ultimately turns out that what offended them was being shown the mess hall, as the thought of communal eating is repulsive to them. Eating and personal displays of affection should be conducted in private at <em>all</em> times, hence their declaration of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCulturalComparison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCulturalComparison">you eat like you mate!</a>"
<ul><li> Averted in that race's second appearance, however, because anyone with two functioning brain cells to bang together should have figured out that bringing a dog to a stand of sacred trees was not a good idea no matter what culture they come from.
</li><li> An ongoing plot detail is that Dr. Phlox's race, the Denobulans, practice polygamy: he has three wives, each of whom also have two other husbands, and so on. They also have looser standards of "marital fidelity" than humans. When he notices that one of his wives is sexually attracted to Trip, he is openly encouraging about it, much to Trip's discomfort. That being said, Denobulans have fairly mature attitudes about sex, so he's not overtly promiscuous either.
</li><li> In a similar case, an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> has Janeway accidentally pay a grave insult to a member of a race that relies on body language for a good chunk of their communication. How? By putting her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTic">hands on her hips</a>, which is their equivalent of the finger.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, Zhaan's people have no nudity taboo, and she finds it amusing that other cultures do.
<ul><li> The Peacekeepers are big fans of letting soldiers "recreate" to relieve tension and produce more soldiers, but forming emotional attachments to partners is strictly against the rules, as is interacting with your child, even once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the season two episode "Acts of Sacrifice", the race known as the Lumati treat sex as casually as they do handshakes (as noted by Dr. Stephen Franklin).
</li><li> In the episode "Soul Mates", Minbari Ambassador Delenn reacts with some confusion at the concept of human bathing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4n5ox');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4n5ox" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4n5ox');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they do clean themselves, using a chemical that removes the upper layer of the epidermis (and frazzling Delenn's new hair); it's the immersion in water that is alien to them</span> (in her words, Minbari do not perspire as humans do, albeit she couldn't finish the elaboration because it made Susan Ivanova uncomfortable). Similarly, after Ivanova washes and fixes Delenn's hair and puts clips on it, Delenn's aide Lennier reacts with restrained horror at the sight of Delenn in hair clips. He asks her if it's painful, and is told that it is "oddly relaxing".
<ul><li> Well, Minbari don't have head hair. At most, they have facial hair. As such, Lennier wouldn't know what it feels like to even <em>have</em> hair. Delenn has deliberately turned herself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> (it helps that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of her ancestors was one</span>).
</li></ul></li><li> Also in Babylon 5, dolls and action figures are expected to be anatomically correct in Centauri culture. Thus in one episode where the station opens a gift shop (selling such products as miniature dolls of the station's public figures), Ambassador Londo Mollari is outraged that the doll with his likeness doesn't have certain "attributes" i.e. genitalia (which, for Centauri males, are in the form of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">six prehensile tentacles</a></strong> protruding from the abdomen). From his perspective, the doll implied that he was a eunuch.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ivanova:</strong> So you feel as though you're being symbolically cast... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondWordSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondWordSwap">in a bad light?</a>
</div></li><li> In season 3 of the show, Delenn reacts in horror when John Sheridan resorts to "thinking like the enemy" in order to guess the stratagem behind the Shadow rampage.
</li><li> In the show, the seemingly harmless question of "What do you want?" is apparently taboo among the Vorlons (Kosh, at one point, berates Sheridan for asking him this). Similarly, the Shadows avoid answering the question "Who are you?"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5mban');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5mban" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5mban');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The taboos are because you're essentially asking the other side's formative question. Asking, "Who are you?" implies you're aligned with the Vorlons while "What do you want?" means you're on the Shadows' side. It's also an early clue that neither side actually remembers their own answers to either question, being consumed entirely by their conflict.</span>
</li><li> For the Narn, all books must be copied <em>exactly</em> from the original manuscript right down to every blemish on the page. Thus it is considered blasphemy to create an English-language copy of the bible-esque Book of G'Quan — as G'Kar tells Garibaldi when he gives him the book to read, it must be read in the mother tongue or not at all (when Garibaldi protests he can't read Narn, G'Kar responds, "Learn!"). Later, when G'Kar's writings unexpectedly become regarded as a new holy book by the Narns, every copy of the book includes a strange ring mark on one of the pages — which is actually a coffee stain accidentally left by Garibaldi on the original page (naturally, Garibaldi thinks that it adds character to the book).
</li><li> Centauri Regent Milo Virini claims that his only vice is "strict sobriety." This is, however, explained. Centauri lives are defined by Duty. So much so that the Centauri made self-care a Duty, so it wouldn't be drowned out by the other duties that govern Centauri existence. Centauri culture is also quite big on recreational drugs. By exercising sobriety, Milo Virini is neglecting his duty to himself by refusing the pursuit of pleasure, and this is considered just as vile as if he had ignored another duty.
</li><li> In <em>Believers</em> we are presented with the 'Children of Time', who do not believe in surgery since any incision of the skin will release the soul. A child whose life Dr. Franklin saves is treated as an abomination by his parents, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who ritually kill the child to reunite him with his soul</span>. The episode is focused on Sinclair's warnings to Franklin about infringing upon the parents' religious beliefs, followed by the parents petitioning the other alien ambassadors to intervene, highlighting the cultural differences among the various races—the Minbari overspiritualize the issue and never give a firm answer; the Narns hide behind bureaucracy; the Centauri are willing to intervene (but at a steep up-front price); and the Vorlons refuse to get involved for reasons known (at the time) only to them. These themes are revisited repeatedly in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em>, practically every world the main characters land on either considers something normal from 'our' world taboo, or something taboo on 'our' world being normal there. Examples consist of a world where all technology and science is banned, a world where "fair trial" means "fastest draw", a world where the "Hippy" lifestyle never died out and so is freely accepted by practically all age-groups, where fortune-telling is a politically-charged position, and where dinosaur-poaching is outlawed. And that's not even half of what they show before Season 3.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Defiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Defiance">Defiance</a></em>, Castithans consider bathing a social and sensuous occasion for the whole family. Learning that his human daughter-in-law-to-be Christie bathes alone, an appalled Datak exclaims "What kind of person <em>does</em> that?"
<ul><li> Not to mention what they consider acceptable punishment for people who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">break social customs</a>...
</li><li> The Omec in Season 3 unabashedly practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Parental Incest</a> (one father is embarrassed about getting caught cheating on his daughter), along with hunting and eating sentient beings, slavery, and breeding life forms to use their body parts for medical purposes. They're practically this trope incarnate.
</li></ul></li><li> In the season 8 episode "Ritual" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, this trope is invoked when the protagonists attempt to talk an Egyptian woman out of making her daughter undergo a clitoridectomy; it is a religious act akin to male circumcision in her homeland, but regarded as a misogynistic act of surgical mutilation in America. Subverting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">Culture Justifies Anything</a>, when she refuses to adhere to the American viewpoint, she is legally separated from her daughter and prohibited from ever speaking with her again.

Same-race relationships, on the other hand, are considered "racist" and are rather frowned upon.

</li><li> A good way to mortally offend many Clan warriors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is to suggest that they might have been <em>born</em> — the old-fashioned way, that is, rather than via the 'superior' Clan method involving the matching of donated genetic material from specific bloodlines and "iron wombs". On the other hand, the separation of sex and procreation in "trueborn" society means that recreational sex is considered just another activity, but concepts like romance and similar strong personal attachments are somewhat alien and confusing to them (at least in part because their first loyalty is of course supposed to be to their Clan).

Then we get the asari, who consider it a <em>horrible</em> taboo to actually get pregnant with another asari (not have sex, just a baby), and look down upon "purebloods", the children of such unions. During the first game and most of the second game, it seems like this is just a cultural thing, even having it explicitly stated that it's because they feel it "adds nothing to the mix" to not incorporate some alien DNA. Then you meet Morinth, an asari with a genetic defect that results in the death of anyone she has sex with, and it turns out that same-race breeding for them drastically ups the chances of things turning out <em>very</em> badly. In ancient times, the Ardat-Yakshi, asari with the aforementioned genetic defect, ruled Asari nations as god-queens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">sacrifices and all.</a>
<ul><li> The hanar are a minor example. In their entry in the codex, they are described as very polite and always talking in a formal manner, to the point that it is actually pretty easy to offend them in a conversation. In a variation of the trope, it's also stated that most Hanar who leave their planet need to be taught how the other races are more informal and that they need to overlook what normally could be considered offensive.

And they seem to know! Upon reaching the village of Dawn's Blossom in the Jade Forest, a nearby noodle salesman will look at you and say, "That creature looks so thin, it must be starving!" Player Pandaren /silly jokes include similar, hilarious lines, like: "Hey! You look like you lost some weight! ... That's terrible. Have a dumpling!" and "Oh, I'm doing great! I mean, I could stand to gain a few pounds sure, but, who doesn't?" and finally, "Gotta store up some fat for the winter! ... I don't hibernate or nothin', I just like having it around." You can practically see the Pandaren holding his belly as he says that last one.

As for being with the same sexual partner for long periods of time, most people consider that strange. Families also don't exist, as children are sent off to Child Development Centers until they are adults. This leaves adults to make as much money and get as much sex as possible. Oh, and it is women who are expected to hit on men, ask them out, pay for dates, and initiate sex. This is often a problem for men who immigrate from rogue states, who still follow the old traditions.

When Kieri point-blank tells him she realizes this, he's worried people will think he's a freak... because they're of opposing elements. The idea that a same-sex relationship might seem odd or objectionable to anyone doesn't even seem to occur to him.
<ul><li> The world of Medius also seems to no taboo against crossdressing. Kieri the angel seems to have never heard of crossdressing before. Because of how militaristic their society is, angels don't appear to even have different clothing for different genders, they instead are required to show their gender by how they dye their hair, with females dyeing most of their hair and males only dyeing the small part that females don't.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider">Outsider</a></em>, the Loroi have a cultural taboo toward casual physical contact since their telepathic ability is distance-variant, and skin-to-skin contact makes an extremely strong connection (and even works to some degree with non-telepathic species). The scientist Beryl, after seeing Ensign Jardin shaking hands with a Loroi pilot and hearing that it's a human custom, is eager to try it since humans are apparently immune to Loroi telepathy.

As a result, being fat became the norm. While anyone outside the vault would think that Twig is too fat, he was in fact bullied all his life for being the <em>skinniest</em> person in the vault (thus the nickname). In fact, when anyone tries to insult him for being fat, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">takes it as a compliment</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Assuming it isn't just propaganda by mainstream Christians, the Borborite Gnostic sect would have hit this button to the extreme, since their version of the Eucharist included eating semen, menstrual blood, and abortions...
</li><li> In ancient Greece, a "Real Man" would find his pleasure with teenage boys, since apparently, that was the macho thing to do. Women were mainly for procreation, and a man who <em>preferred</em> to sleep with them was considered something of a sissy, or just downright weird.
<ul><li> According to some sources, the man-boy love was supposed to be refined and spiritual. Actual physical intercourse sullied the relationship (women, on the other hand, were inferior creatures who could be used for physical pleasure). Although, to the Greeks, only penetrative sex is considered intercourse, mutual masturbation is fine.
</li><li> Also, being well endowed was considered comical and barbaric - real men didn't have big dicks (a resemblance to young boys' was preferred, hence the lack of endowment in Michelangelo's <em>David</em>, modeled on Greek statues). Furthermore, a publicly-visible penis wasn't all that bad, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagingStiffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagingStiffie">having an erection</a> was considered shameful.
</li><li> They thought it transferred arete from the man to the boy. A similar thing is found in Papua New Guinea, where it's thought that boys will never become men if they don't eat a steady diet of semen. However, vaginas are considered "poisonous," so once a man has slept with a woman, he can't feed the boys anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern military forces frown on sexual relations between soldiers. Thebes, on the other hand, encouraged them, creating the Sacred Band, composed of 150 pairs of lovers, which is often credited with a decisive role in Thebes' defeat of Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra. Supposedly, this made soldiers more willing to die for their comrades/lovers. Of course, the Theban army was composed of men only...
</li><li> In modern Western culture, premarital sex is accepted, and even considered normal. Couples can live together without being married, and even raise a family like that. One can go home from a nightclub with someone he/she has just met and have sex. But go to a conservative country or region with deeply-entrenched traditional values regarding marriage and sex, and such behavior is frowned upon at best, and (in some cases) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">capital offense</a>.
<ul><li> And this is a relatively recent development even in the West. Sex has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in most cultures for most of written history.
</li><li> And even within the West. Nearly everything mentioned above would be maligned in the more conservative areas of the US, while no one would bat an eye in liberal cities like New York or Los Angeles. And even in New York or Los Angeles, there are numerous jokes about the so-called "walk of shame", referring to someone post-one-night stand heading home in the early morning, wearing the party clothes they wore the night before, making it obvious to most people what they've been up to. Whereas in somewhere like Paris, people will all but congratulate you on having gotten some good lovin' the night before.
</li><li> This is inverted in some places in the US, such as college campuses. Seeing someone at the coffee shop in the morning wearing last night's mussed-up clothing barely merits a second glance. The joke being "we don't have the walk of shame, we have the stride of pride." Well, that, and the fact that the person is more likely still up from last night due to cramming or working on a project/paper that is due that day.
</li><li> In Russia and other former Soviet countries, it is still considered strange for a couple to be dating for a long time before getting married (i.e. what is commonly accepted in the West). Any dating period lasting more than a few months starts getting looks. This was slowly changing, due to Western influences (with words like "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" being adopted by the Russians), but many traditional Slavic customs remain, especially in rural areas.
</li><li> Can be mildly inverted in some crowds in the West-say you don't believe in sex before marriage, and they'll say something like "What? Seriously?" Moreso in some circles where promiscuity is the <em>expectation</em>, namely athletes and musicians. Athletes who are forthright about their virginity, such as Tim Tebow or Lolo Jones, have been criticized on that basis.
</li><li> Sex education in The Netherlands begins as early as <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/6Cxb3v_tT00">primary school<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for children as young as 4. This is certainly in stark contrast to conservative regions of the US that insist on abstinence-only teaching. Even the more liberal areas of the US don't start until 5th grade (age 10-11).
</li><li> Similarly, in some places being openly LGBT (of whatever variety) is considered perfectly acceptable, along with any kind of non-heterosexual/non-reproductive sex. In other places (and historically far more) this would only take place in secret, with these acts being illegal, even capital crimes.
</li></ul></li><li> The National Geographic show <em>Taboo</em> discusses things that are taboo in Western society, usually in non-Western cultures but it sometimes discusses various subcultures in Western society.
</li><li> The Sioux don't even have taboo words. You'll find men named Penis or Testicles and women named Vagina with no trouble whatsoever.
</li><li> Dietary law? Try having an interfaith dinner with the Hindu who can't eat beef (and may be a vegetarian), the Jew who has to eat food prepared ritually (and won't eat pork, shellfish, and meat-dairy combos), the Muslim who has to have food prepared ritually according to other rituals (also no pork, but no alcohol too; meat-dairy combos and shellfish are OK), and the Sikh who can't have any meat that <em>has</em> been prepared ritualistically. Oh, and did we mention that if you have more than one Muslim, they might end up arguing about whether the Jewish rituals are "close enough"? Also, Mormons cannot have "hot drinks", erroneously believed to be a complete caffeine taboo. The Muslims, Mormons, and, depending on the domination, some of the other Christians can't drink alcohol. Meat in general can be taken off the menu if it's Friday during Lent and you've got Catholics around. And that's not even <em>considering</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy">food allergies</a> and intolerances! Sure, you <em>could</em> just serve pasta or pizza, except that someone on your guest list has celiac disease. Not to mention, people who are on strict diets (e.g. vegan, keto, etc.) for personal reasons or health reasons or both.
<ul><li> Order the salad! Oh, wait. You'll have a problem with the Jain who can't eat root vegetable (carrots, potatoes, radish, turnips, etc), the Yazidi who can't have lettuce, the Buddhist or Krishna who can't eat onions, the Jew who can't eat any fruits or veggies without first examining every inch of them for bugs, and the Kashmiri Brahmin who won't eat strongly spiced food (so no pepper, garlic, or onion).
</li><li> Note on Catholics: Good news and bad news. Bad news is there is a growing trend among more traditional Catholics to go back to the original rule of no meat on Fridays at all, which is officially the case in the UK. Good news is that the dietary laws don't consider fish to be meat.
<ul><li> If the fish bit is news to you you've never been past a seafood place during Lent. Or, for that matter, have never watched commercial television during Lent: You ever wonder why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> and the other lot all of a sudden start to advertise fish sandwiches and other fish-based products—sometimes even creating them from scratch "for a limited time" (see: Mickey D's "Fish McBites")-for several weeks in the spring? Simple-Catholics.
</li><li> The Filet-O-Fish was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald's franchise owner in Cincinnati. His store was in a predominantly Roman Catholic neighborhood, which led to falling hamburger sales on Fridays.
</li><li> If you're in Venezuela, capybaras (the world's largest rodent) are exempt from the no meat rule.
</li></ul></li><li> If you invite a few unbelieving friends along, this could apply if they're vegetarians and vegans provided their choice of diet is based on moral stances (is meat murder, or not?) And then there's the fruitarians, who turn the whole thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li><li> Eating dogs or cats is considered normal in parts of East Asia and West Africa (as long as they are dogs and cats you <em>own</em> and not <em>stolen</em> from others), but in places who value pets such as the West or even other parts of Asia or Africa, this is <em>terrifying</em> because how could you eat those <em>pets</em>?! And it should be noted that even though only older generations (people who were born pre-1990s] still eat dogs due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> and the fact that younger people find those animals unappetizing nowadays, it is still normal and not frowned upon in said regions.
<ul><li> Same with eating horse meat. Perfectly sensible in most of the world, but taboo in many English-speaking countries.
</li><li> Not all younger people find it unappetizing. While the trend has been that fewer young people eat dog due to Western influence, it is still appetizing to some and basically just a normal meal like eating beef or pork. People's reaction to this and the closing of many dog-meat restaurants due to backdraft is a contentious topic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Kissing. Not taboo <em>per se</em>, but its level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">seriousness</a> varies A LOT from culture to culture, as well as the kind of kiss-a warrant was put out for Richard Gere's arrest after he kissed an Indian actress on the cheek, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a> and a co-star were chased away from the Western Wall after filming a kissing scene - behavior that wouldn't have batted an eye in the US.
<ul><li> This gets worse if it's a same-sex couple, of course: hence why about a decade or two ago (up until around the mid-2000s), gay kisses on TV were often controversial, if less so now in the West. Conversely, the taboo itself is considered a form of anti-LGBT discrimination by LGBT rights supporters, and as a result can even be against the law (a pub in the UK which threw out a gay couple for kissing was successfully prosecuted).
</li><li> Relatedly, hugging. The "European Cheek Kiss" is much like a hug in the US, but hugging a stranger or a mild acquaintance in, say, France, runs into the same problems as kissing someone would have in the US. Its basically like the meanings of the two actions got switched somewhere over the ocean.
</li><li> <em>Any</em> form of touching, for that matter. Even in the United States, there are cultures and societies that forbid even holding hands until marriage.
</li><li> Islam almost forbids any form of (adult) male and female contact outside of the family.
</li><li> Public displays of affection are (traditionally) more frowned upon in Japan than in the West. Being a touch-averse society, for instance, bowing instead of shaking hands, the Japanese traditionally reserve physical affection for close relatives, especially small children, and sex partners. Thus, what Americans would consider relatively innocent public displays of affection would, in Japan, be regarded as boasting that a lot more is going on behind closed doors. The taboo is such that Japanese children are unlikely to see so much as a chaste kiss between their parents. Meanwhile, while the Japanese have to an extent adopted Western attitudes toward nudity, the nudity taboo is not as strong as it is in the West. Thus, mixed bathing is permitted to a greater degree in Japan, and nudity can be found in works marketed toward children, and can even include children (in a non-sexual context).
</li><li> In many Middle Eastern cultures, physical contact between friends, especially male ones, is much more common than in the West. Young men walking around holding hands or even hugging is completely normal and not in any way sexual.
<ul><li> Similarly, most Middle Eastern societies have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a> compared to Western ones, as people will happily converse mere inches from each other's face, while Western culture dictates that people should be at arm's length.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Mosuo culture, a small group in China, have been described as a "world without husbands or fathers." Men and women never get formally married, but go through long courtship rituals competing with other guys, and it's wrong to feel jealous if a girl chooses someone else. The man will continue to visit the woman for the duration of their relationship, sometimes with months between visits. The fathers are not considered related to the children, only to the mother (there's no stigma when a woman doesn't know which man fathered them-although it's considered embarrassing-though most do not change partners frequently, although this may have been a more recent change under pressure from the majority Han Chinese, who disapproved of their promiscuity). Instead the children's uncle will care for them, doing household tasks, while women do the hard work and run the family.
</li><li> An American teacher living in Japan was becoming annoyed that so many of his co-workers and students were commenting on-and complimenting/congratulating him on his recent weight gain. A colleague finally told him that they weren't trying to insult or ridicule him. Quite the opposite in fact—they had assumed that he had met a woman who was a good cook—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughHisStomach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughHisStomach">a catch for a man from ANY country or culture</a>—and were happy for him.
<ul><li> Not only Japan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot">James Herriot</a> tells in his books that he received a number of such compliments from farmers once he married.
<ul><li> This is also the case in Africa and the Caribbean, where overweight women, particularly those with large rear ends, are traditionally considered more attractive than skinny women. Often heard in calypso and dancehall, but is sometimes present in American black culture too (Sir Mix-a-lot's classic "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffyOldSongsAboutTheButtocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffyOldSongsAboutTheButtocks">Baby Got Back</a>" being a prominent example). In Mauritania, girls are even sent to so-called "fat camps" to gain weight and be seen as desirable.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Dress codes. What many people consider normal would be considered slutty in more conservative cultures.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Discordianism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Discordianism">Discordians</a> will happily marry just about anyone to any combination of people or things but may have some reservations about joining a man and woman in holy matrimony (note that, like the image boards example, this is to poke fun at existing taboos).
</li></ul><ul><li> Holding up your index finger and middle finger while spreading them apart. In some countries, this is a symbol for peace, in others, it represents "V for Victory", but in Britain, it's considered an offensive gesture, similar to raising just your middle finger. Though, that depends on which way the palm is facing. Facing outwards, it's a symbol of peace but if the palm is facing inwards it's a less-offensive version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a>.
<ul><li> In Greece the "V" sign is considered offensive with the palm facing outwards, though it is not as obscene as holding up your hand with all fingers spread with the palm towards the other person. The "V" sign is considered a reduced form of the latter.
</li></ul></li><li> Breastfeeding in public. In some places it will be cheered on, in others will get you arrested for disorderly conduct, and in further others simply not paid attention at all for being considered the most normal thing ever.
<ul><li> And commenting on it as well. In some places, you so much as pull a face or look to see what they're doing, you'll be yelled at for being a misogynist with no respect for something so natural, in other places, all you have to do is mention it to the manager and you can have the mother and child thrown out and barred for life.
</li><li> Also, the duration of breastfeeding. In India and the Philippines, mothers breastfeed their infants for two years or longer. In the US, Canada, and Great Britain breastfeeding after 6 months is unusual, and breastfeeding for a year or more is very taboo. Mothers who breastfeed longer than that typically hide the practice from others, known as "closet nursing".
</li></ul></li><li> Jesus is a common given name in Spanish and Arabic (particularly among Arab Christians). In English? Name your kid that and expect to be swarmed by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/jesus/comments">cries<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/forums/viewthread/4030/#29194">blasphemy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The anglicization of Jesus (Yeshua) is actually Joshua, and there are plenty of American people called that. It is a bit like how in the Muslim world, you will rarely find anyone named Muhammad (since only the prophet can be called that), but in other places, you'll find plenty of Mohammeds or Ahmeds (both of which are derived from the same name).
</li><li> Italy has some <em>legal</em> restriction on names that can be given to a child, including "Gesù" (the Italianization of Jesus), names considered ridiculous or linked to misfortune (such as "Venerdì", Friday in English. A couple actually had their child named by the registry officer for insisting on said name and was fined when they sued) or handicaps, most names linked to geography, a parent's name, a name of the opposite gender, and many others. This isn't exactly out of some cultural taboo but to protect the children: Italians mock <em>everything and everyone</em>, and a child with a name such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini">Benito</a> would become a target for all the other kids.
</li></ul></li><li> Cursing:
<ul><li> Countries like Germany and the Netherlands consider religious cussing to be <em>eons</em> less offensive than say, the United States. Even in first grade, one can get away with terms like 'hell', 'damn', 'devil' and 'Satan' without so much as a judging glare.
</li><li> Such words aren't considered even remotely linked to swearing in France and Italy. "Hell" is just the religious place, "Satan" and "Devil" mythical figures. Actually you'll get glance if you act like if they <em>were</em> offensive.
</li><li> You don't even have to get that far from the USA. In Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, phrases like "¡maldición!" ("damn!"), "¿Qué diablos?" (roughly corresponds to "what the hell?"; literally means "what devils?") and even "(vete) al diablo!" and "vete al Infierno" (literally "(go) to the devil" and "go to hell"), can be heard in family-friendly media. The word "Infierno", used to refer to Hell as a place, is never censored or even avoided at all; "jokes" where characters can't say the word "hell" fall completely flat after dubbing. However, words like "estúpido" and "idiota" ("stupid" and "idiot") are much stronger than in English, and then there's "pendejo", (in some countries it refers to pubic hair, but in Mexico, it's more or less the equivalent of "dumb-ass" or "stupid-ass") which is considered much more offensive than "idiota" or "estupido"; "son of a bitch" is also <em>much</em> stronger than in American English; it's translated as "hijo de puta" (literally "son of a whore"). "Puta" is usually bleeped or not said at all on TV; its synonym, "ramera," won't get bleeped, but it's still considered a demeaning word, and hardly ever heard on TV as well. The literal translation of "son of a bitch", "hijo de perra", is also very strong; "Coger", in most Spanish-speaking countries means "to grab" or "to pick up," but in Mexico, coger means "to fuck."
</li><li> On the other hand, Quebecois French swear words are <em>all</em> based on religion, to the point where they are referred to collectively as <em>sacres</em>.
</li><li> Even words such as 'shit' aren't censored in any media anywhere (the German equivalent of 'shitty' is even less offensive; for instance, it made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>'s 'It Hits The Fan' episode less poignant than it could have been), except maybe (obviously) in shows targeted at kids below the age of ten. It depends on where you look, however, and is not always consistent—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> will sometimes bleep the word, and sometimes they won't.
</li><li> The American versions of most cuss words are considered even <em>less</em> offensive than that, to the point that they are featured in some kids' shows (like the Scotsman constantly saying 'sheet!' in the German dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>). This can lead to quite some unintentional humour when Germans witness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">people in American media</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">reprimanding or being cross with others for being very very mildly bawdy</a>.
</li><li> Mature sexual slang, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">on the other hand...</a>
<ul><li> With the exception of England in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">one particular word</a>. Still rude, but nowhere <em>near</em> as shocking as in the US.
</li></ul></li><li> Australia is also okay with swearing, for the most part; some radio stations are even fine with songs featuring the F word being played mid-afternoon. Only racist epithets get outrage.
</li><li> In the Netherlands, most common swearwords come in one of two flavours: either sexual, as is common in other languages as well<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6o1gu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6o1gu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6o1gu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">there's equivalent words for things like "dick" and "cunt" and so on, usually with similar weight</span>, and <em>diseases</em>. "Rot" serves as a very mild adjective/adverb, a bastardised version of "cholera" is a common interjection sort of on the level of "shit", angry Dutch people tell each other, basically, to contract pleuritis (there's even two different words for this, with different weight!), and <em>god forbid</em> you call someone a "cancer-"anything<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7nbzb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7nbzb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7nbzb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"cancerwhore" is a common variant aimed at women; a slightly bastardised "cancer-sufferer" will do for anyone</span>, you've probably just made an enemy for life (though the word tends to be used more freely by young people). "Shit" and "fuck" have also gained a lot of traction however, and are fairly commonly used, though mostly as interjections or exclamations.
<ul><li> Notable exception to the "similar weight" of sexual swearwords: the Dutch word for "cunt" ("kut") is usually used as an adjective or an exclamation, and is nowhere near as offensive as in English - it's used more like "shit(ty)", to describe weather, behavior, situations, misbehaving appliances... More offensive if used on people.
</li><li> The same word in the United States is quite obscene. In England and Australia, it gets thrown around a lot more casually.
</li></ul></li><li> Even within the US it varies wildly. In the conservative South "hell" and "damn" are quite serious swearing, and even "heck" and "darn" are pushing it; in the West Coast and Northeast, they're so mild people forget they're curses at all. "Fuck" and its infinite variants have the same issue, being either an extremely taboo term or a meaningless emotional intensifier depending on who's speaking.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nudism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nudism">Nudist</a> culture. Played reversed if you should ever attempt to wear a swimsuit while inside a nudist retreat. It's all or nothing. (The thought is that if everyone is naked, it's normal; make exceptions and it will become sexualized.)
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/naked-germany/index.html">In Germany, it's quite common for people to be naked on beaches and in parks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This can be shocking to tourists from other parts of the world, who are baffled by all the naked people lying in the sun
</li></ul></li><li> Applying this trope to animals is pretty much a given, as they do not have a set rule for how they should live like humans do. The simplest example would probably be the nature of poisonous animals being brightly colored; from a human standpoint, a creature like a poison dart frog is beautiful because of its bright, vibrant colors, and even people who know that the little critter could kill you with a single touch find them utterly adorable. Any predatory animal in the wild, however, would be <em>terrified</em> of all those colors, as they're a warning sign that this animal is <em>not</em> to be ingested.
</li><li> There are many countries, most notably most of the ones in eastern Asia, where speaking ill of any political leader is blasphemous. Either you speak praise about him or her, or you just stay silent, as you are expected to have absolute loyalty to your country and prioritize their beliefs over your own. In more extreme cases, you pretend you like them. This can come across to westerners, who mock and insult their political leaders all the time, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a> (and, depending on how you look at it, might actually be that). At the same time, people from these countries who travel to the west are often horrified at how everyone seems to treat their leaders as trash.
</li><li> Calling someone a monkey in the USA has a history of racism; that goes without saying for Americans. However, in Spanish-speaking countries like Argentina, its akin to being called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">a bear of a man.</a> This caused an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossCulturalKerfuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossCulturalKerfuffle">uproar</a> when a Swedish clothing retailer produced a sweater reading "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle", and had a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/19/hm-faced-backlash-over-its-monkey-sweatshirt-ad-it-isnt-the-companys-only-controversy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6f970ed2ef6c">young black man modeling it in their catalog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Many Americans were outraged at the racial insensitivity, while the company maintained that no racial implications were intended.
</li><li> In Australia and New Zealand, calling people monkeys is mostly a playful expression of affection, used to describe children or used between adult friends. It can be racist, but only when it's referring to Indian people; racists using the term against other races is very uncommon. When New Zealander-born NBA player Steven Adams referred to his mostly African-American opponents as "quick little monkeys" in one interview, it sparked widespread outrage in America with some calling for him to be fired, and utter confusion in his native country.
</li><li> In May 1997, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5117897/amp/Mom-jailed-leaving-baby-OUTSIDE-restaurant-speaks-out.html">Danish actress Anete Sørenson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> left her infant daughter outside of a Manhattan restaurant while she had a drink. She was arrested for child endangerment, spent 36 hours in jail, and her daughter was placed in foster care for four days until the situation was resolved. There was outrage at her actions from Americans who found her behavior highly stupid, irresponsible, and dangerous... and outrage at her arrest from Danes, who repeatedly stated that such a practice is very common in Denmark.
<ul><li> This is such a common problem that Americans traveling to foreign countries (and vice versa) are actually given handbooks to warn them about how commonplace behavior in one place can be considered anywhere from rude to outright illegal elsewhere.
</li><li> This <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/reader-center/free-range-parenting-outside-united-states.html">New York Times article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> demonstrates it even further — most European and Asian parents think their American counterparts are far too clingy/uptight/overprotective. Indeed, many American expats have reported getting funny looks at their child-rearing habits. Most of the parenting practices described in the article wouldn't bat an eye in their respective countries, but a good chunk of them would get the police or CPS called on them in the US.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/faith-and-character/faith-and-character/what-sports-illustrate.html">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article discusses how an American college professor in Italy stopped by the <em>piazza</em> of a local church where he saw some kids playing, and taught them to play baseball. He commented that the scene would be unthinkable here in the US, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">his actions would have earned him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">a visit from the police.</a>
</li><li> To most Indians, the idea that American parents, no matter <em>how</em> wealthy, generally expect their children at some point to get jobs <em>and</em> move out of the house when they reach young adulthood seems counterintuitive at best and cruel at worst. And it boggles their imagination that parents visiting their grown children in the U.S. sometimes stay at hotels nearby rather than avail themselves of their children's hospitality. But to Americans, those are simply expected demonstrations of self-reliance, and not imposing yourself on the support of others.
</li><li> Likewise, it shocks some foreigners that Americans sometimes pay their own children for doing housework and that even within immediate families goods change hands for money (albeit at less than market price). To Americans, nothing in life should be seen as free.
</li><li> Online communities with dedicated members like fans of a specific work or subculture develop their own system of what is and isn't okay, and these often clash <em>wildly</em> with each other or with "NORPs" (Normal Ordinary Responsible Person, pretty much the most flattering of slang words for passive internet users who aren't familiar with internet subculture). This can lead to anything from mockery to outright battles when someone unfamiliar with it comes in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">takes offense to the term "Newfag"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">innocently drops a slur or trigger word</a>, or when a NORP enters either of those sites and finds the denizens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">passively talking about Waifus, shipping, weird fetishes, etc</a>. These are only a few of countless examples: they could easily fill the entire page.
</li><li> Throughout the late 1980s to the mid-2000s, it was common for English dubbing companies to make changes to anime to try and make it more appealing to western viewers. These included changing character's names, changing their personalities, changing plot points, changing the soundtrack, editing foreign words and signs to English, and editing or cutting out scenes that could be considered offensive. This is rarely done today by these companies as fans at the time decried it as them forcefully "westernizing" Japanese shows and sullying the efforts of the original creators. However, Japanese dubbing companies frequently use similar tactics when bringing western shows to their country, often to great success and much less criticism from their fans for the changes they make.
</li><li> A lot of cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">Misplaced Nationalism</a> between countries usually boil down to violations of deep-seated cultural taboos on the part of another country.
</li><li> The custom of tipping gets Americans and Europeans discombobulated when they travel abroad to each other's countries. In the former, it's expected, as wages for waitstaff are very low and they depend on tips to survive. In Europe and other places, service charges are tacked onto restaurant bills. In some places like Japan or South Korea, tipping is even an insult (order more food if you want to show your appreciation at a restaurant there).
</li><li> The Japanese adult industry (particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">hentai</a> side of it) produces some of the most depraved, extreme, often sickening, sometimes even horrifying pornographic content in the history of mankind, much of which (particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">Lolicon and Shotacon</a>) is <em>illegal</em> in many other countries... but the genitals always have to be censored. <em>Always.</em> It doesn't matter if the material is like something out of a particularly extreme rendition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAristocrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAristocrats">The Aristocrats</a>, the penis and vagina have to have at least <em>some</em> token censorship over them to comply with the law, whether it be black bars or pixelization. It's a constant source of irritation for western hentai fans, and the first question usually asked whenever any hentai work is given a western release is "Is it uncensored?" This sometimes even extends to spoken words as well, leading to hilarious scenes where a woman is begging to have all sorts of excessively lewd and depraved things done to her, but the word "manko" ("pussy") will still be inexplicably bleeped out. Sometimes they even bleep out "chinpo" ("penis"), although that's less common.
