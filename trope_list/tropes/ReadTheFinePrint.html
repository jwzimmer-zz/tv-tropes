The sneaky party will use this to coerce the signer into doing their bidding or taking their stuff, while simultaneously avoiding all consequences.
</p><p>Most stories with this plot usually center on the signer trying to find a loophole to escape the contract, or otherwise live up to the much steeper conditions in order to finally complete it and render it fulfilled. On the positive side, if the series enforces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, then you can expect the contract to get destroyed and/or overruled due to even more obscure legalese by a friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Tropers should rest (mostly) assured that civil code contract law has clauses against "obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a>" terms written into a contract. That said, there's plenty of non-egregious ways a contract can harm you — not to mention what counts as legally "egregious" is only extremely outrageous things or something specifically mentioned in law. Judges don't like to overturn a contract unless it is clearly illegal. And the law very often does not prevent "unfair" contracts. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">unnecessary technicalities</a> are bad for business, right?
</p><p>Also rest assured that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw">common law</a> jurisdictions (basically in any English-speaking country outside the heavily French-influenced Quebec and Louisiana), courts will exclude anything in the fine print that the signor shouldn't expect and are generally more favorable to signors than drafters when it comes to standard form contracts ("contracts of adhesion" in lawspeak — or sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract">Leonine Contract</a>) under the doctrine of unconscionability. In fact, U.S. law prevents disclaimers from having any actual force in law. However, if it's not a standard form contract—i.e. you negotiated the contract out, personally or through a representative, with the other guy—expect this trope to be the case, since both parties should have been paying attention when it was written. Although this can also get complicated: "I didn't know that the contract required me to ship 10,000 suspenders" is not an excuse, but "I didn't realise that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">my American business partner meant 'trousers' when the contract said 'pants'</a>"/"And I didn't realize that my British partner meant 'garters' when the contract said 'suspenders'" might be.

Historically, Anglo-American contract law was resistant to any attempt to get out of a contract; "hard law" was the rule of the day. However, over the course of the 20th century judges and legal scholars grew increasingly uncomfortable with the consequences of "hard law", and adopted all kinds of rules like unconscionability,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jc22');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jc22" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jc22');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The contract overwhelmingly favors the more powerful party</span> mistake,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17cyp');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17cyp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17cyp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Misunderstanding/not knowing a fact about the world material to the contract. Can be bilateral (the parties both misunderstood each other or both misunderstood the world; a Briton sending his "pants" in exchange for an American's "suspenders" would be an example, as would the buyer and seller of a house in another city that, unbeknownst to them, was at that moment being destroyed by a hurricane) or unilateral (one party misunderstands, and the other should have known about the misunderstanding and cleared things up).</span> frustration of purpose,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bp0n');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bp0n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bp0n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Whatever it was you wanted the contract for was taken away by outside forces. This doctrine came up when someone rented a room to watch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Edward VII's</a> coronation procession, only to find that the coronation was delayed because the King was ill; he could still sit in the room but without a procession to watch, what's the point?</span> impossibility,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note357d2');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note357d2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note357d2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, more or less. The classic case is this: Seller ships Buyer 5,000 pairs of pants (either sense) from Bangladesh to Britain. While passing through the Red Sea, the ship gets attacked by Somali pirates and the container containing the pants falls to the bottom of the sea. Seller doesn't have to deliver the pants, or send another 5,000 pairs, because the shipment was destroyed and his performance was impossible. (It is a little more complicated with shipping, as that's where those shipping terms like "FOB" and "CIS" come from, but let's not get into that.)</span> and impracticability<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4d4bp');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4d4bp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4d4bp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A California innovation, essentially meaning "we <em>could</em> do it, but something unforeseeable happened that makes it prohibitively expensive"</span> to soften its impact, to the point where this trope no longer really applies except where many if not most folks would say "Yeah, you should probably have read the fine print." Courts in non-common law jurisdictions are even more hostile to fine print, and will likely rule <em>any</em> fine print clauses in standard form contracts to be unenforceable. In countries based on Roman law, the civil code heavily restricts the types of clauses that can be put into these sorts of contracts. Recent changes to contract law in many places also enforce a defiance to this trope, at least in the exaggerated way it's been shown most often in comedic works, with a standardized font size for all text within the contract — simply said, if it's so small that you need something more powerful than a magnifying glass to read it (and <em>that</em> can only be justified if your vision is poor), then it's unenforceable by default. Issues because the contract was written in a language the signer did not know are still struggled over (depending on such things like whether or not there is a record/witnesses of the exchange), but it is normally expected that if the signer at any point says before signing that he doesn't understands what the contract says the other party will either give a contract that can be understood or back off until the signer can find someone that can help him translate.
</p><p>In any case, one can contractually rescind any of one's legal rights except for bodily freedom and life. Joining the military, working for the government (FBI, CIA), or just agreeing to arbitration (giving up your right to sue in court) in a contract, are ways you can give up your rights.
</p><p>In fiction, the law is pretty clear though — if you signed it, then you agreed with it. Otherwise you wouldn't have signed, right? No one held a gun to your head (if they did, then it is void, if you can prove that). Long story short; read the damn contract. And if it's a particuarly important contract, it's a darn good idea to retain a lawyer to go over it with you.

This gives black mages access to a wide variety of extremely powerful effects, but always at a price — a good black mage takes advantage of the power they're granted, but the drawbacks can lead you to ruin. The most common of these are "pay X life: do Y" cards, which generally represent a <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15193">Faustian bargain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Three of the options are highly beneficial, while the fourth is "You lose the game." The list of official rulings for the card includes a snarky reference to this trope:
<div class="indent"><strong>6/22/2015:</strong> Yes, if the fourth mode is the only one remaining, you must choose it. You read the whole contract, right?

</li><li> Scrooge has found himself on the wrong end of these, as well. In "The Horseradish Story", an ancestor of his signed a contract 200 years ago without reading the fine print. (The ancestor, a Seafoam McDuck, had misplaced his spectacles — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> would later imply the other party, a Swindle McSue, was responsible for the misplacing.) According to that fine print, Seafoam had to deliver a case of horseradish to Jamaica or forfeit his assets to Swindle, who sabotaged the trip for that very purpose. Because Seafoam never gave him a set of golden teeth, a Chisel McSue, last heir of the McSue Clan, got a court order allowing him to claim Scrooge's estates, minus an old set of clothes. Fortunately, even that court order had a fine print, which Scrooge read. It stated Chisel couldn't take possession for 30 days, and even then only if Scrooge failed to fulfill the terms of the original contract. Before becoming wealthy, Scrooge sold the aforementioned teeth to buy a prospector's outfit, making it so he couldn't fulfill the contract by any means other than recovering the case of horseradish and delivering it to Jamaica. His nephews use this trope against him in the same story, making Scrooge sign a contract stating he will pay them their 30 cent wages, since Scrooge has tried to cheat them in the past. At the end of the story, Scrooge refuses to pay what he considers an outrageous sum — 226 dollars. The nephews reveal the fine print of the contract he signed: either pay the full amount, or eat the crateful of horseradish.
</li><li> Taking a leaf after Swindle McSue, the Beagle Boys once tricked Scrooge into having to deliver a crateful of eggs to the Island of Ripan Taro to avoid having to give them his fortune. When it seemed the delivery would be done, he tripped and the eggs cracked, revealing the eggs weren't of the indicated species. Scrooge invoked this fact to claim "the contract is no good" because the Beagle Boys "misrepresented their cargo".
</li><li> Subverted in the chapter "King of the Klondike"; when Scrooge needs money bad, he's forced to go to Soapy Slick for a loan. After Scrooge signs the contract, Soapy reveals that his contracts don't need fine print...just enough space to make changes wherever he wants, such as turning the 10 % interest rate to <em>100%</em>. While Scrooge could have easily contested this obvious fraud, Soapy flees to Canada with the contract. It isn't until after Soapy is deported back that the contract is restored to its original terms, which Scrooge pays off in full in "The Billionaire of Dismal Downs".
</li><li> In general the comics employed extreme amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License  Law</a> when dealing with contracts and most of the problems this trope created in-universe would not exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> because that is just not how contracts work.

</li><li> Dogbert isn't actually reading the contract, he just likes to look at documents and say "yadda yadda yadda..." However he does recommend retyping the contract to benefit Dilbert and then sending it in. They can't proofread all of them can they? (Someone later did this in real life)

Mandy claims bossing Billy around is <em>her</em> privilege but the scoutmaster shows her the fine print: all rights revert to him. So Mandy adds Grim's name to the contract.

When the producer gives up on the idea to start another movie, he reveals that, according to the fine print, Spidey doesn't "get any money until the picture is completed". Spidey will never be paid for his work in the film because it'll never be completed.

She, however, was more careful about reading the extremely tiny fine print and crossed out two clauses (including the same "after-death" clause that had been in her parents' contract), telling the lawyer to bring back a copy with those two removed.

The contract alarms most of the parents, but they sign anyway, given that they have no real choice. Wonka cites this contract in the end. However, the contracts they signed carry absolutely no legal weight. Note that the kids sign, not their parents. The kids are all <em>minors</em> and therefore can't enter into any kind of a legal contract. The parents can do so on behalf of the children (although there are hundreds of laws covering that and Wonka would have needed an army of lawyers standing behind him), <em>but the parents don't sign.</em> Hey, Wonka? Good luck in front of an English Barrister with a contract containing microscopic fine print that is also signed by people who aren't allowed to sign a contract... However, unlike most examples of this trope, Wonka wasn't trying anything outrageous. Charlie forfeited the prize by stealing from the factory. Wonka probably wouldn't need a contract to enforce that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bedazzled2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bedazzled2000">Bedazzled (2000)</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser">Brendan Fraser</a>'s character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">sells his soul to the Devil</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethHurley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethHurley">Elizabeth Hurley</a>) by signing a ridiculously huge contract without reading. Throughout the film, the Devil "reminds" him of various clauses from the contract, which is all news to him. Interestingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the way out of the deal depends on him <em>not</em> having read the contract (i.e. he has to make a selfless wish)</span>. According to the Devil, no one ever reads the damned thing (pun intended).
</li><li> A variation on this appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause">The Santa Clause</a></em>, where the border on Santa's business card is revealed to consist of a contract written in microscopic print, the general gist of which is that protagonist Scott Calvin is now Santa Claus, whether he likes it or not. And then in the sequel, an even <em>more</em> microscopic clause reveals that he has to get married or he'll lose his powers.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>. Initially, Fred plans on reading over all the forms before signing, citing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">once getting screwed over by a plumber because he didn't read the forms first</a>, only for his secretary, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Cliff Vandercave</a> to convince him not to.

While it doesn't legally commit him to anything, the fact that he signed it looks like he was planning to flee the US.
</li><li> An example shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld">Wayne's World</a></em>, but it pans out quite differently from most examples. The other party is a sleazeball but never attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">move the goalposts</a> and most of the terms he gets Wayne in trouble over are relatively reasonable by entertainment industry standards. In fact, if Wayne had bothered to get a lawyer and read and negotiate a bit, most of the plot could have been avoided.
</li><li> In the 1957 musical of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiedPiperOfHamelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiedPiperOfHamelin">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</a></em>, the Mayor produces the 'receipt' for the piper's services, carefully unrolling only the bit where his signature goes. Suspicious, the piper insists on reading it...and the unrolled scroll stretches halfway across the room. "I see as we go up the line the print gets rather fine." After various deductions for unrelated expenses, and a clause that his fee can be held in escrow for a hundred years, the contract ends by stating that the Piper must pay 50,000 guilders (the entire sum he's owed) should the rats come back. We all know what happens next.
</li><li> Inverted for the same effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrokerAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrokerAce">Stroker Ace</a></em>. Clyde Torkle's contract is so long that its bound form is larger than most phone books. That and some quick smooth talk ensures that Stroker signs it anyway, even after insisting that he read the whole thing. Torkle then spends the movie forcing Stroker through some truly embarrassing advertising gags. In addition, Torkle worded his contract so that Stroker can't race for three years if he quits. Stroker spends the rest of the movie trying to get Torkle to fire him so the clause doesn't come into effect.
</li><li> A minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFounder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFounder">The Founder</a></em>. When the McDonald brothers finally agree to accept Ray Kroc's buyout, an important condition is that they keep the original restaurant. It's implied that they don't realize, until later, that the settlement gave Kroc the trademark on the name "McDonald's", meaning that they can no longer call their restaurant by their own name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMadMagician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMadMagician">The Mad Magician</a></em>, Gallico discovers that the contract he signed with Ormond means that all illusions he designs—even those he creates on his own time—are the property of Ormond. Losing the rights to 'The Lady and the Buzzsaw'—the signature illusion he developed to launch his own career as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMagician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMagician">Stage Magician</a>—is what drives him to snap and murder Ormond.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em>, the Cat never even gives Sally or Conrad the <em>chance</em> to read the contract (which is the size of a phone book), merely stating it guarantees them "all the fun you want and nothing bad's ever gonna happen". At the end of the film, with their house wrecked and their mother on their way home, the Cat reads them some of the contract's clauses and reveals that they've fulfilled its terms: he thus holds up his end of the bargain by rebuilding their house and making it look like nothing happened, ensuring they won't get in trouble.

He clarifies with her that he will not be punished for refusing a task, which she agrees is accurate. She then gives him his first task (investigate the death of the Summer Knight), and he refuses. At which point she causes him <em>excruciating pain</em> because she <em>feels like it</em>, not because he refused. She didn't break the letter of the agreement, after all.

Heinlein</a>'s <em>The Man Who Sold the Moon</em>, Delos D. Harriman, "the last of the Robber Barons", mentions that the roadways he owns that are used by most of the population to commute and move goods have small print on the ticket that says that the company will only "attempt" to get them or their goods to their destination and if the company fails it is only liable to refund the price of the ticket. Using the roadway means agreeing with this. Harriman says he got idea when he worked as a clerk for the Western Union telegram service. By signing the front of a telegram form most people didn't realize they were agreeing to all the small print listed on the back of the form. Harriman read the back in his free time on the job and admired it. This sort of caveat is actually fairly common in contracts, in the form of a "force majure" clause that releases someone from a contractual obligation if uncontrollable circumstances make it impossible to comply.

Checking out a book (an action which they define as moving any object with text on it from its original location) is considered acceptance of their terms. It is possible to get them to explain this beforehand, but the librarians will only explain the rules of the library in their common tongue, which has been a dead language outside of the library for millennia. There are books on how to translate that language in the library, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma">but attempting to read one of them would constitute checking out a book</a>.

Good deal, right? Not really-the small print says that it's not one hour per hour, it's one hour per hour, <em>per hour.</em> Essentially, the longer you take to pay it back, the more the compound interest racks up, so that you end up paying back hundreds of hours from your lifespan even if you only used five or so. This leads to people aging swiftly or even dying. And if you try to mess with the device, you invalidate the warranty and pay back all of the time right there and then. Eventually, the Doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">crashes the value of every single debt, buys them out from the Time Market, then cancels them</span>.

</li><li> Subverted in <em>Lost in Music</em>, a memoir by the music journalist Giles Smith: reading the fine print didn't help. Smith was in a band which was offered a contract. They wanted a lawyer to check the contract, but the only lawyer they could afford was Smith's father's friend, who was a solicitor specialising in house conveyancing. He told them that it was a terrible contract, but no one was offering them a better one, so the band signed it anyway.

The other three copies, which she didn't read after signing the first one, had it the other way around.

<ul><li> If you live in a Commonwealth country, thank Lord Denning above all for repeatedly emphasizing that contracts need Full Knowledge and Approval. In a nutshell, if something unexpected is hidden in the fine print, it's unlikely to be enforced against the sap who signed the contract.
</li><li> Something of a subversion of this is common in online auction sites, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">eBay</a>. Sometimes, a seller will post an item for sale, and clearly label the sale as "just the box," such as "iPhone X Smartphone (Box Only)." Despite a clear and repeated disclaimer that "this is just for the box it came in, item not included," several people will bid the price up and purchase the empty box, then are disappointed when only the box arrives. People bidding on such items have their blinders on, which is what the seller of the box is counting on. But if you think about it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">why would somebody go on eBay and post a listing for an empty box, if not to give the impression that there was something in it?</a>
<ul><li> In many collecting communities, people deliberately <em>will</em> buy an empty box. For example, someone may own a near-mint Generation 1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Optimus Prime</a> action figure, but not the box it came in. So he buys the box online to display in a fancy case behind the figure.
</li><li> A more straight example was once seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy">Judge Judy</a></em> involving a lawsuit in which a person listed what was supposedly two Nextel cell phones in an auction, but in the fine print said that what was being sold was only <em>pictures</em> of the cell phones. Judge Judy was not amused, and quickly ruled in favor of the plaintiff.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1988, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> struck a deal with Ken Kutaragi of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> to design the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> sound chip. When he did, Kutaragi snuck in a trojan horse: Sony would be given any and all CD-ROM software royalties. Nintendo, who were big on third-party royalties, missed this detail until a few years later when they had decided to work with Sony on a CD-ROM add on for the SNES. When it looked like Sony was not going to ease on the terms, Yamauchi reacted with one of his trademark outbursts, pulled out of the deal, signed a more favorable one with Philips, on the night before the CES that would have marked the official debut of the Nintendo/Sony partnership. Even though Sony and Nintendo rejoined for one last attempt at a joint CD-ROM console a year later, Sony would depart for good to design their own system, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>. The whole affair, borne of a project started in secret by Kutaragi, triggered one of the most seismic shifts in the history of the video game industry.
</li><li> Certain offers, usually found on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>, promise free music downloads in return for signing up for a service that sends trivia or jokes to your phone. All you have to do is give them your phone number and fill in on their website the number they text to you. The catch is they bill your phone bill directly either weekly or monthly if you don't request them to stop after you get your "free" one. They also sell your number and can telemarket you for up to six months without violating the Do Not Call registry. If you think this is frustrating, take pity on the cell phone customer service people who have to explain to you what you signed up for.
</li><li> Usually more in point: EULAs (End-User License Agreement. Who reads all of those?!)
<ul><li> Played with nicely by the author of Spybot S&amp;D: "This is dedicated to the nicest girl I've known" rather than all of the legal jargons most EULAs use.
</li><li> In some jurisdictions it would prove quite diffcult for a company to enforce their EULAs in court, because the buyer usually only gets to see the EULA when he/she installs the software, i.e. after buying it. Therefore, one cannot assume informed consent on the buyer's side.
</li><li> Some of them include a clause that if you do not agree to it, you should bring the product back to the store. Whether said store will actually return your money, in the age of CD and DVD burners, is another matter entirely.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ypc4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ypc4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ypc4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at least in the U.S. In other countries, the store are forced to accept the disk anyways, especially if the disk is defective, unless the store's policy states otherwise.</span>
</li><li> When EA's <em>Origin</em> DRM-Software was introduced with <em>Battlefield 3</em>, there was quite an uproar about the extent of the rights given to EA in the EULA to install very invasive spyware on customers' computers. An EULA falls under <em>general terms and conditions</em> in German law and any paragraph that would be considered "unexpected" in such contracts is automatically null and void. And since giving a company free rein to install spyware when all you wanted was to buy a game is definitely unexpected, this falls very much under "unexpected terms", so the installation would be illegal and a criminal offense. As a result, several large electronic store chains offered to take the game back even when opened. It remains yet to be seen what will happen with Origin.
</li><li> Google Chrome originally had the same EULA as everything else they had. It's fairly strict normally, but in context it basically said that they owned the Internet.
</li><li> EULAs aren't really fine print, though; everything is written in the same font size. The reason for this is in most modern countries, putting anything important in fine print is a bad idea. Attempts to hide important clauses show bad faith, usually nullifying the contract if it harms the signer (but still valid if it harms the person who wrote it). Needless to say, savvy contract writers find other ways to hide the nasty.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">erotic visual novel</a> Cross Days actually used it for good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">(and giggles)</a>. Pirated copies of the game have a trojan that added personal information of the user to a public website, and to take it down the users had to admit to illegally downloading the game.
</li><li> Averted with free and open-source software licenses, which don't require people merely using the software to agree to anything just to use the software (use is unlimited anyway). For example, Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the Linux kernel, semi-jokingly gave owners of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">sharks with frickin' laser beams</a>" as acceptable users; contrast the iTunes EULA. Reading the license is only required for those modifying or distributing software, whose terms vary somewhat between licenses, with simpler licenses such as that of BSD and the X Window System mostly just requiring credit to be given while more complex licenses require the source code to be distributed (but only if the program is distributed at all) and/or require patent holders to license any patents that cover code they contribute.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42j1c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note42j1c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42j1c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Apache License 2.0 requires the latter but not the former, while version 3 the GNU General Public License and all versions of the Mozilla Public License require both (previous GPL versions only required the former), though the MPL is less strict about requiring new code to be distributed in source form (only modifications to existing files with the MPL, and all files period with the GPL.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In German contract law, there is a special section for "general terms and conditions" of purchase contracts, which are predefined by the seller and not negotiable, like store policies or the EULA of software. As it is not expected that customers understand or even read such contracts, or are even aware that they exist when they buy something in a store, the most important part of the law makes any terms or conditions that are "unexpected" in such a contract null and void. To discourage businesses from trying to sneak unexpected terms into a contract and hope most customers won't notice, the invalid paragraph is not replaced by the next best thing they are legally allowed to put into a contract, but by the absolute legal minimum which is usually highly beneficial to the customer.
</li><li> Funny or strange cases involving odd uses of fine print show up all the time in contract law classes. One case involved a company who included the words (paraphrased) 'Congratulations! If you read this you are eligible for a bonus! Just send your email to us!' in the middle of one of their online agreement contracts; a couple of people did so, and it turned out the company was serious, as they <em>actually did receive free money out of it</em>.
<ul><li> Another UK case involves GameStation, where, for an April Fool's joke, they included a clause in the contract for buying one of those games claiming that by agreeing to this EULA, you agree to surrender your soul to GameStation, all written in completely straight-faced legalese. There was an option to proceed without relinquishing your soul, and the few that chose this option (and therefore had read the terms thoroughly) received a £5 GBP voucher.
</li><li> The iTunes EULA contains a line which reads: <em>You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, <strong>the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons</strong>.</em> It was once technically meaningful (albeit very <em>pro forma</em>, and now obsolete). iTunes contains encryption technology, which under US law formerly made it classified as a <em>weapon</em> and subject to export and usage restrictions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/van-halens-legendary-mms-rider">standard tour rider contract with venues<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> famously included a line buried deep in the text, specifying that a bowl of M&amp;M's be placed in the band's green room with all the brown ones removed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">In this case, the band wanted the line to be found</a>. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwHO2HnwfnA">explains,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Van Halen's show was so big that there were extensive contract requirements for the venue. The rider included many pages of safety requirements that the venue had to fulfill, due to the pyrotechnics, electronics and a flying harness that the band used. These effects could cause serious injury or death to someone if the requirements were not followed to the letter. The M&amp;M's clause was their way of testing whether or not the promoter had actually read the contract and followed every instruction. A bowl that contained brown M&amp;M's (or no bowl of M&amp;M's at all) was an indicator that the promoter hadn't entirely read the contract. This meant that the Van Halen's crew had to either line-check the contract or cancel the show outright due to safety concerns.
<ul><li> This lead to a case where an entire stage collapsed from the sheer weight of Van Halen's equipment as the venue manager didn't even read about the weight restrictions in the contract. Which lead to a rumor that David Lee Roth caused $12,000 in damage to a venue for having Brown M&amp;Ms.
</li></ul></li><li> Zeca Pagodinho once signed a contract to become spokesman to a beer brand named "Nova Schin". But later started making commercials to another brand even saying on them he was wrong on choosing the other one. He later claimed the clause he broke wasn't verbally agreed on and that he signed the contract without reading because he trusted them. A good deal of people in Brazil (the country where it happened) believes him to be either stupid or a liar.
</li><li> Many countries have laws that put a minimum font size on the fine print, in order to guarantee that the average person is at least <em>capable</em> of reading the fine print. An example of this popped up on a cruise liner that advertised a very cheap fare, only to put in small font (as in, so small you would literally need a microscope to read it) "for the first night only." Several passengers sued, and the cruise company was found guilty of fraud.
</li><li> In the US, several judges have ruled that you cannot just put anything into the fine print and be considered legal. So you can't put, say, "must pay it all within a week or lose all your assets". There is a common sense and decency clause to all contracts. If a party violates them (as decided by a judge), not only is the contract null and void, the signee usually comes out ahead.
</li><li> Many jurisdictions attempt to clamp down on excessive legalese and jargon with guidelines stating that in any case involving a dispute between two signing parties of a contract, weight will be given <em>against</em> the party that <em>drafted</em> the contract. True, there have to be clauses to cover any number of contingencies, but in this way, there is an incentive to avoid confusing wordplay and indecipherable terminology in order to draft contracts in clear, unambiguous language that all parties can understand.
</li><li> In the US, many coupons have disclaimers that read "Cash Value 1/100th Of 1 Cent", or some other infinitesimal value. This goes back to the era of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_stamp">trading stamps,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when customers would accumulate them when they purchased something and later trade them in for ostensibly free items (think Skee-Ball tickets). Starting with New York in 1904, states passed laws that force trading stamp companies to provide a cash value for the stamps; naturally, the companies set the value as low as possible. Eventually trading stamps were superseded by coupons as customer loyalty promoters, but the laws didn't distinguish between the two and the cash value requirement remained.
</li><li> In Swedish contract law, the importance of the fine print depends (among other things, like the informed consent problem for end-user licence agreements) on <em>who</em> is entering into the deal: contracts between two individuals or two organizations are covered by the Contract Law, while contracts between an individual and an organization are covered by the Consumer Contract Law<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5m6x3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5m6x3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5m6x3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">'consumer' since the overwhelming majority of individual/organization contracts, implicit or not, are from persons buying or renting something</span>. The laws are very similar, but with one general difference running through them: the Consumer Contract Law makes <em>far</em> more rights and protections for the consumer when entering into a contract un-waiveable no matter what the contract says.
</li><li> "Low cost" airlines are probably the most well-known example, particularly European ones. Say an airlines advertises "Frankfurt London from 19" - basically everything in such an advertisement should (or does) come with an asterisk. "Frankfurt" can mean <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93Hahn_Airport">Hahn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> some 100 km away. "London" will certainly not mean Heathrow or City, but may well mean <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Airport">Oxford<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Southend_Airport">some other place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> nowhere near London. European courts have ruled more than once that such naming (frequently of the style "big city"-small hamlet airport with the big city a hundred or more kilometers away) is either illegal or should come with a disclaimer regarding the actual distance involved. Now to the price: Of course this is the cheapest one way fare they technically offer. Excluding any luggage, beverages, food and sometimes even seat reservations. Some airlines even charge extra for carry-on bags. EU courts have once again stepped in and drawn the line at unavoidable taxes and charges, which have to be included in the advertised price, but charging for printing out a boarding pass or using the wrong credit card is fair game, as long as it is clearly stated somewhere.
</li><li> This trope explains how Joe Torre resigned from being the Manager of the New York Yankees in 2007 after twelve seasons with the team.
<ul><li> After several first-round losses the the American League Division series, GM Hal Steinbrenner told Torre he'd give Torre a non-negotiable one-year, performance-model-based, contract with a 5 million USD base pay. However, making each of three benchmarks would a million USD bonus to his pay:
<ul><li> Help the Yankees win the American League Division Series.
</li><li> Help the Yankees win the American League Championship Series and get to the World Series, which also enabled a new contract the following year.
</li><li> Help the Yankees win the World Series.
</li></ul></li><li> As his base pay would have been cut from a guaranteed 6.4 million USD each year (although this contract had the potential to make him at the time the highest-paid manager in baseball), Joe Torre turned down the contract and left the Yankees, becoming the Manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers for the next two years.
