</p><p>This trope is usually confined to good fictional royalty. Evil royalty tend to go overboard with their costumes and impressive crowns.

He is the son of Prince Abdael, who was passed over for kingship in favor of his brother Zak. Abdael turned traitor, becoming leader of the anti government forces. Saki either dresses in regular military fatigues, a flightsuit, or a simple shirt and tie. Additionally, despite being royalty, in the Asran military, Saki is only a Lt. Colonel and not even a full Colonel, let alone a Brigadier General. He's not a crown prince so Saki has no real reason to wear more princely garb, and especially since Asran is supposed to be a poor country, he probably hasn't got the means to.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> An early 1900s Afrikaans (South African) short story invokes this. It details a dream in which the protagonist, a farmhand, visits the King (of the British Empire). The King lives in a two-story farmhouse, and the protagonist throws pebbles at the upper bedroom window behind the house to attract the King's attention. He then drinks tea with the King under the large eucalyptus tree in the back yard (the Queen brings the tea tray) and they discuss current affairs. Except for addressing him as "o Koning" ("o King") at every possible opportunity, the King gets no special treatment from the farmhand, and by the former's reactions in the dream, this is apparently accepted protocol.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Author:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> A very common trope with David Eddings, whose nobility tend to wear their regalia only when real monarchs would: at formal occasions for dramatic effect. This is probably based on the simple fact that wearing excessively ornate clothing is heavy, uncomfortable, and hot.
<ul><li> Notably, near the beginning of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad">Belgariad</a></em>, where Anheg, King of Cherek starts talking to Belgarath in a flowery, poetic language. Belgarath then responds with a sort of "what's up with the language, dude?" and the response is "well, we wanted it to look nice in the history books". From there on, though most characters are either royalty or nobility, only very corrupt nobles make a point of wearing their finery.
</li><li> Belgarath himself isn't technically royalty, but <em>is</em> an ancient immortal, the first disciple of the god Aldur, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">the most powerful sorcerer in the world</a>. He also has fashion sense and personal hygiene comparable to a hobo. Said hobo outfit was actually <em>made</em> to look scruffy so he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">pass as a wandering storyteller</a>. It was custom tailored and is both incredibly comfortable and so well-made it has lasted <em>five centuries</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalloreon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalloreon">The Malloreon</a></em> has Emperor Zakath who, in complete contrast to the opulence of the palace he lives in (he inherited it that way rather than creating it to be such), dresses in such a simple white robe that it's easy for him to travel through his empire as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a> (even the streets of his own capital city). And once he grows a beard, even people who had met him in person have trouble recognising him, such is his lack of pomp.
</li><li> Taken to such an extreme with Zakath that his subjects don't recognize or salute him when he passes by: "The Emperor is a man in crimson robes who rides in a golden carriage, wears a terribly heavy jeweled crown, and is accompanied by at least a regiment of imperial guards all blowing trumpets. I'm just a man in white linen riding through town with a few friends." Note that this is <em>not</em> a deliberate case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a> until he joins Garion's travels (and his one amendment to deliberately evoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a> is... to grow a beard).
</li><li> Partially employed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em>; while courtiers are often described wearing ornate and rather ridiculous court fashions, serious or competent nobles tend to downplay their finery to tasteful elegance instead of ermine and other ornate details. In fact, most respectable monarchs are described as disliking court functions precisely because they're so overblown. Ehlana, the Queen of Elenia whom Sparhawk serves as Champion, is an exception; while she dresses sensibly enough, she likes court functions and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect">Ermine Cape Effect</a>. The narrative explains that this is because of her neglectful and abusive childhood, during which formal court events were the only times anyone treated her with any sort of attention or respect. After they marry, Sparhawk actually has to <em>force</em> his wife to not issue him stylish clothing or a rapier.
<ul><li> Thoroughly averted in the same series, in Sparhawk's interactions with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Bhelliom</span> - he <em>has</em> to use formal, archaic patterns of speech and thought or it won't deal with him, because it believes formality helps shape history.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a> loves this one. It's not guaranteed that the fancier a noble's dress the further to the bad s/he is, but it's usually a safe bet:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em>: These characters, in contrast to Emperor Charliss, who wears silk-velvet robes that are so heavy that it takes two servants to lift them, and Prince Karathanelan dresses ornately even for combat practice. Charliss is something of an exception, though, as his rich robes are of a very austere cut and color, for the "making himself look badass" principle.
<ul><li> Queen Selenay, Prince-Consort Daren, and Grand Duke/King Tremaine wear high-quality but simple clothing, avoiding heavy robes and large crowns.
</li><li> High Priest Solaris has to wear ornate robes for rituals, but her everyday clothing is the robes of a simple Sun-Priest (though of a finer quality of fabric).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms">Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> From <em>One Good Knight</em>: Queen Cassiopeia wears rich gowns all the time, but her daughter, before she was coerced into dressing for her rank, Princess Andromeda could have been mistaken for a palace servant.
</li><li> While she's not royalty, Godmother Elena only wears her elaborate gowns in situations when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField">Background Magic Field</a> of "the Tradition", demands it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonJousters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonJousters">Dragon Jousters</a></em>: Ari and Nofret only wear royal garb when they have to. They hate how uncomfortable the stuff feels.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a> tends to give the more sympathetic royal characters in her books this trait. In the first book in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheImmortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheImmortals">The Immortals</a></em> of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall</a> series, when Daine first meets Queen Thayet, she's surprised to learn that Thayet is, well, the Queen, because she's dressed very plainly. In fact, one could go far as to say if a character likes dressing up really fancy all the time, they're probably evil. Examples include Roger from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness">Song of the Lioness</a></em>, Ozorne in <em>The Immortals</em>, Joren and to a lesser extent Blayce in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall">Protector of the Small</a></em>, Imajane and Rubinyan in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickstersDuet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickstersDuet">Trickster's Duet</a></em>, and any noble antagonist in any of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse">Circleverse</a></em> books. Good characters like dressing up sometimes, but only in very simple and understated fancy outfits. The more jewelry and makeup a character wears on a regular basis, the more evil they are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the exception of Dove in <em>Trickster's Queen</em> because she's embracing her "native" side by wearing multiple rings</span>. And if a character does dress to the nines at every occasion and isn't evil, they are at least dismissed as very flippant or silly or petty and mean.
<ul><li> Ironically, TP is so into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn">long, loving descriptions</a> of what <em>all</em> of her characters are wearing that the effect of any contrast is sort of lost on the reader. She can spend just as much time telling you someone's not dressed up as that they are.
</li><li> One notorious subversion was a story told to Daine, in which Thayet had been dressed up in a <em>very</em> expensive dress for a court function, but was called to fight bandits in her capacity as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Commander of the Queen's Riders</a>. The bandits were defeated, but the dress most emphatically did not survive.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen">Fred Saberhagen</a> uses this trope a lot. In his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireOfTheEast">Empire of the East</a></em> trilogy, Emperor John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Ominor</a> wears simple white robes with black trim and is otherwise a fairly ordinary-looking man. He's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, which just goes to show you that this even villains can be modest. Later, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfSwords">Book of Swords</a></em> trilogy, set thousands of years later but in the same fictional universe, Yambu, the Silver Queen, is depicted as preferring to dress casually and is generally pretty informal, despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a>. Interestingly, she is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the first couple of books, until another shows up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">at the end</a>. Later, when Mark becomes the Prince Consort of Tasavalta, he continues to dress like a soldier. The Emperor (the one from the Swords series, not Ominor) is a subversion: he dresses like a shabby clown, but, despite his title, he is not really the ruler of anything (well, except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Universe</span>).
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Work:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The Conatic from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance">Jack Vance</a>'s <em>Alastor</em>-series combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a>: his appearance is so unremarkable that he frequently walks among his many subjects unrecognized.

<ul><li> Eon has that as one of his chief traits. When first we meet him he is <em>Arm-Wrestling</em> with Roman soldiers.
</li><li> Shakuntala once has to dress like a prostitute as part of her disguise-and right there decides it would probably be more comfortable then normal clothes for a princess. It also served some practicality for her: a princess would be expected to wear a fairly tight-fitting dress that restricted leg movement while the prostitutes wore loose silk pants... and the assassin-trained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu">Waif-Fu</a> expert knows what she'd rather fight in.
</li><li> Theodora, by contrast is almost always as Imperial as she can get. She grew up a street girl, has had enough of it, and once she gets to be an empress, by golly she's gonna act like one.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, Jerin mistakes Princess <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odelia</span> for a common soldier when he first meets her. The rest of the royal family seems to dress like this, too, as no explicit mention is made of extravagant dresses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>: The crowns of the Kings and Queens of Narnia are described as being simple circlets, rather than the traditional real-world style baroque monstrosities. The rest of their clothing is not mentioned in any detail, except for Lewis emphasizing that in Narnia one's 'best' is also one's most comfortable clothes.
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Aslan</a> summons Helen, a commoner from our world, to become the first Queen of Narnia she arrives in a simple dress and hands still soapy from doing the dishes. The narration notes that if she had known what was about to happen she would have put on her fanciest outfit, which was tacky and foolish-looking.
</li></ul></li><li> The assorted (good) royalty in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfPrydain">Chronicles of Prydain</a></em> are pretty much <em>all</em> this trope, except at court. Special mention goes to Prince Gwydion, who dresses so plainly that on their first meeting, Taran thinks he's lying about his identity. Princess Eilonwy is Modest Royalty not only in her attire but also in her manners - so much so that she never even thinks to mention that she's a princess throughout the entire first book. Both Taran and the reader only learn about it on literally the last page.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em>, after the reveal of Tavi's true identity as Princeps Gaius Octavian, he eschews finery, preferring instead the uniform of a Legion Captain (which he is), because there's a war going on. The one time he's seen in all his finery, he's getting married.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror">Conqueror</a></em>: Jelaudin in <em>Bones of the Hills</em> is an interesting case. When introduced, he's spent most of his life in fancy clothes, as befits the prince of Khwarezm. However, after Samarkand falls to the Mongols and the shah dies, he is reduced to wearing rags. He goes on to raise an army, largely by making a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">rousing speeches</a>, and the fact that he doesn't wear fancy clothes is one of the things his men respect about him. Indeed, when offered the chance to wear something more fitting than rags, he refuses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CradleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CradleSeries">Cradle Series</a></em>: Akura Mercy is the daughter of the Monarch Akura Malice, who owns a significant portion of the world.

His coming has been prophesied, but he's not there just to be feted, so he rejects the ornate garments they offer him for military uniform.
</li><li> Several examples from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series:
<ul><li> King Verence II, due to him growing up a jester. He spends most of his time in his work clothes and actively tries to lessen his own power and prestige, much to the confusion of the traditionalist people of Lancre. (Queen Magrat would like to do the same, but is told the rules are different. Kings can go around with "the arse hanging out of their trousers"; Queens have to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">Pimped-Out Dress</a>.)
</li><li> Vimes, too, fits this mold. After being promoted to Duke of Ankh, he goes out of his way to remove most of the frillier things in his "traditional" dress outfits—partly because he's always hated the upper class, and partly because (from the descriptions), they'd look ridiculous. He even gets into this as Commander of the Watch: for example, when his wife buys him new, expensive boots, he always trades them for the cheap, barely-a-sole-to-them boots like he used to wear, because he can tell exactly where he is in the city based on how the stones feel on his feet.
<ul><li> When the soles of Vimes' boots are too worn to be considered boots anymore, he replaces them with <em>cardboard</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sybil, Vimes' wife, may be one of the wealthiest women in Ankh-Morpork, but she spends most of her time in work clothes tending to swamp dragons. They're well-made work clothes that will last for years, but still work clothes.
</li><li> And another ruler who shuns the fancy stuff: Havelock Vetinari. He doesn't even dress as a high-class Assassin despite having attended and graduated from the school; instead of Assassins' traditional stylish black, he just wears plain, plain black. Back when he was still an active assassin, he preferred brown, gray, and green - essentially a variation of modern-day camouflage, as he realized that the regulation black is almost always visible except in deepest darkness where you can't see anything, anyway. He did wear black whenever attending the guild functions though, since anything else would have gotten him kicked out.
</li><li> Not to mention Carrot Ironfoundersson, who'd rather remain in the Watch than be acknowledged as the rightful king of Ankh-Morpork.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">main characters</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieRawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieRawn">Melanie Rawn</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonPrince">Dragon Prince</a></em> trilogy behave according to this trope. They get dressed up only to impress people and on formal occasions.
</li><li> Frank Herbert's original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> did exactly this. The narrator takes great pains to point out that Emperor Shaddam IV rarely bothers to wear imperial regalia; he prefers an only slightly more ostentatious version of the uniform worn by the Sardaukar, the Imperial House Corrino's military force, although it's less "modesty" and more "naked show of force".
</li><li> King Mendanbar from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em>. Not only does he dress very casually, he hates formal occasions and cancels as many as he can get away with, much to his steward's dismay. At one point, another character chides him for it, saying he should at least wear the crown or else no one would know who he was.
<ul><li> Cimorene is even worse; more especially when she was Kazul's princess you are more apt to see her in sensible clothing with an apron. Even after marrying Mendanbar she sticks to it. And their son Daystar sticks to the trend, though in the beginning he didn't <em>know</em> he was a prince.
</li></ul></li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> gets ennobled on Grayson she starts wearing dresses, but due to her utilitarian nature from her military career tends towards very simple styles. Queen Elizabeth takes a liking to Honor's fashions, and - well, nobody argues with the Queen of Manticore.
<ul><li> Given the description of the traditional unisex formal Manticoran court clothing (basically the result of a clown car colliding with a tuxedo), the simple dress is a huge improvement.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Julian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Julian">Julian</a></em> takes up celibacy and asceticism. Unfortunately, his flaws more than make up for these virtues.
</li><li> In one version of the <em>King Midas</em> story his princess daughter went to school with the other children, dressing and acting like a fairly ordinary (if wealthy) schoolgirl, despite all the extravagant luxury she had back home.
</li><li> King Birtram of Binn in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a>' book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingsStilts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingsStilts">The Kings Stilts</a></em> is a workaholic most of the day whose one pleasure is cavorting on his stilts on late afternoons. The book notes that the citizenry notes while this is an unusual thing to have, the King is perfectly entitled to his dirt cheap hobby.
</li><li> Having grown up a rural farmgirl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryPrincess">Honorary Princess</a> Dorothy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books prefers to keep her clothing simple.
</li><li> Chell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MasksOfAygrima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MasksOfAygrima">Masks of Aygrima</a></em> never wears anything befitting his status as a prince, this is justified as he only has access to regular clothes for a while. This is completely subverted once he gets back to his ships though, as he dons very elaborate but still practical clothes.
</li><li> Prince Josua from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> - admittedly only the King's brother, but quickly becomes the replacement of choice once Elias does his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>.

</li><li> The opening of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a>'s <em>Michael Strogoff</em> features the Tsar of All the Russias wearing "the simple uniform of a cavalry officer." Of course, cavalry in those days often had some pretty flashy "simple" uniforms.
</li><li> Played darkly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">the Lord Ruler</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy">Mistborn: The Original Trilogy</a></em>. Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of the known world, he only wears a subdued black-and-white ensemble that's not hugely different from the day-to-day outfits preferred by the nobility (and is a lot less ostentatious than what many of them wear), and doesn't wear a crown or any visible signifier of his station at all. He <em>does</em> wear a lot of rings, bracelets, and other jewelry, but that's for magical purposes and mostly hidden under his clothing rather than on public display. It's explicitly noted that the reason he does this is actually an understated statement of authority; he's an absolute monarch, revered as a living god, and has his image plastered on statues and stained-glass windows across the empire - everyone knows beyond doubt that he's in charge, so why should he <em>bother</em> with the superficial trappings of rank? When Elend becomes king, he initially doesn't wear a crown (and in general acts more like a high-level clerk than a king), but an advisor suggests he wear a simple circlet for the look of it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Elend:</strong> The Lord Ruler never wore a crown. <br/><strong>Tindwyl:</strong> The Lord Ruler never needed to remind people he was in charge.

The fanciest it gets is when Princess Klia has to do some negotiations with another nation. And it is fancy only because she wears tons of jewelry, and this is for tactical reasons (since the 'faie have an intricate gift culture: Klia has received most of said jewelry as welcome gifts and is more or less obliged to wear them. Aside of that such gifts are usually done by simply giving the necklace you wore yourself. Klia wears an arsenal of tactical maneuvers.)

She/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he</span> grew up far away from court and is used to simple, comfortable clothes, and for a good while just feels silly in a dress.

Feist's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em> uses this a lot. Most of the protagonists (especially in earlier novels) are gruff, tough, no-nonsense types from the rugged western frontier, so they tend to dress sensibly and conservatively and act in a very straightforward manner. Meanwhile nobles from the Kingdom's eastern realm are courtiers and intriguers, and they keep up with the latest trends and dress ostentatiously, and are portrayed as being isolated from the rigours of life in the real world.

When Cao Rui of Wei spends too much money on palaces, Yang Fu cites a number of precedents in history. On one hand were the kings and emperors who had modest palaces and were considered wise and left strong legacies. On the other were those who built extravagantly and lost their empire, or had their successors lose the empire. Rui ignores, and the Wei dynasty is eventually supplanted.

<ul><li> In the Dunk and Egg short story "The Sworn Sword," Lady Webber is something of a tomboy and tends to dress in plain, outdoorsy clothes. When Dunk first enters her courtyard, he assumes that an older, better-dressed woman is the lady, overlooking the young woman in leather practicing archery.
</li><li> The Starks (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Sansa</a>) tend to prefer simple clothing, as do most nobles in the North. Even their crown is simple, made from iron and bronze rather than gold or silver. The idea is that gold and silver, while pretty, are weak. The Stark crown is made of tougher stuff, because to be King in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">North</a>, you need to be tough.
</li><li> The even grimmer, even upper north elective tribal monarchy of the Wildlings does not feature any distinction in appearance at all. Mance Rayder, the King Beyond The Wall, looks just like any other Wildling. No crown, of course. Some of the tribal chiefs, however, try their own ideas of bling, like the "Lord o'Bones" who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">wears an egregious amount of bones</a> on his fur armor.
</li><li> The Braavosi nobles wear simple black clothes, while poorer classes are peacocks.
</li><li> Stannis Baratheon, Lord of the Narrow Sea, Master of Ships, and claimed King of the Seven Kingdoms, dresses and acts like a soldier, wearing plain grey plate in battle and drab clothes outside of it, with the only sign of his power being his rather spartan crown. His meals and quarters are also fairly plain.
</li><li> The Prince of Dragonstone in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>. Granted, Duncan the Tall isn't the world's smartest Knight, but he manages to not be aware that he's talking to the Heir Apparent to the Targaryen king.
</li><li> The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch already exists in pretty modest state, but when Jon Snow becomes Commander he rejects some of its few signifiers, rarely keeping guards with him and choosing not to dwell in the Commander's normal tower quarters. Melisandre considers this its own form of pride and that the trappings of authority are important to retaining it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and given Jon is later murdered by his subordinates may have a point.</span>

He wears the same black armour with spikes as his followers, and while other scro paint the spikes brightly, or use jewels if they can afford it, Grimnosh's are just a dull, grey metal. A <em>very expensive</em> dull, grey metal.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em> the Kholin family follow the old codes of war, which mandate that they wear a military uniform at all times when in camp. The father Dalinar, uncle to the king, is the one who insists on this and doesn't even paint his Shardplate, leaving it grey. His eldest son Adolin would be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFashionista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFashionista">fashionista</a>, and is alternately jealous and appalled by how some other officers dress; jealous that they have the freedom to dress however they want, and appalled that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyTackyClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyTackyClothing">that</a></em> is how they use their freedom.
</li><li> A non royal example is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline-191</a></em> series, Jake Featherston. During his rule as President of the CSA he prefers to dress in a Sergeant's uniform instead of anything gaudy or elaborate. Considering that he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of Hitler this is understandable.

Vollys later says that she knew Addie was royal or at least noble when she noticed this, because her noble prisoners always pick plain clothes and the peasants pick the elaborate jeweled gowns.
</li><li> In <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>, Emperor Gregor deliberately avoids the Barrayaran mania for military regalia and wears conservative civilian suits for most occasions. Though as commander-in-chief he is entitled to wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">pimped-out uniform</a>, he wears it only when ceremonial duties require it. This is partly tacit acknowledgment that he has never meaningfully served in the military, and partly to support the image of his "progressive" reign. Miles mentions that lesser nobles are somewhat grateful for this, as it means they themselves are spared from having to wear their own (uncomfortable and complex) pimped-out uniforms.

Subversion of the usual rule since he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">an undilutedly evil bastard</a>: he may ponce around in a gleaming white frock coat/tuxedo with gold trim, a golden pendant the size of a dinnerplate (which is the Centauri counterpart to a crown of state), and <em>white spats</em>, but it's still <em>much more</em> subdued than usual Centauri dress. Hell, even Vir is flashier! Most importantly, he wears his hair short even though the size of a Centauri's hair fan traditionally indicates his status.
</li><li> Played straight with Emperor Turhan, Cartagia's predecessor, who refused to wear a wig in his last days because he wished to appear as he was rather than as tradition said he ought to be.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> features a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a>, and therefore dress sensibly.
<ul><li> Stannis Baratheon, in particular, especially when he compared his his brothers, as he dresses much like his men, with very few royal affections in his dress in general, and forgoes wearing a crown - even more modest than his book counterpart, who wears a crown shaped like flames. (Stannis's younger brother Renly Baratheon, on the other hand, wanders about in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">silly crown made of stag antlers</a> and loves dressing extravagantly.)
</li><li> House Stark, compared to other great houses:
<ul><li> Ned Stark is definitely one of the most humble noblemen in all of Westeros. Case in point: when the servant who receives Ned in King's Landing asks if he'd like to change into something more appropriate for the King's Council meeting, Ned just takes his riding gloves off and goes as he is.
</li><li> Like Stannis, Robb Stark dresses much like his men. Furthermore, he doesn't wear a crown - though neither do Stannis or Balon Greyjoy. (Among the Five Kings, only Renly and Joffrey wear one.) Even his book counterpart wears a crown in the same style of those worn by the old Kings of Winter. Additionally, when the Stark troops cheer after their first victory against the Lannisters, the first thing he does is to somberly remind his men that the war has only begun, and that their final victory is far from assured.
</li><li> Like Robb, Jon Snow wears no crown after he is declared King in the North, and continues to dress the same way he did before.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li> It says something about their house that for the most part, Sansa was the only one who wears Southern-inspired flashy outfits (in Season 1 due to being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, Season 2 onwards due to being a hostage in King's Landing), and even she chooses to mute her style further come Season 6, wearing a Brunswick green layered dresswith the Stark insignia embossed in gold. Quite flashy for Northern wear, but definitely muted compared to the South.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Ironborns aren't flashy about their status compared to other nobles. Even when they become king, the crown is simply a piece of driftwood. That's because <em>pirate</em> is the emphasis in the term "pirate king."

He is another Final Fantasy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">royal who actually does things</a>.

Her most common costume is a purple shirt, a blue vest, white trousers and black thigh-high boots. She only really gets one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">Pimped-Out Dress</a> in all thirteen episodes.

<ul><li> Ruling princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance wear crowns, collars, and metal hoof covers akin to slippers, but nothing else, not even for most special occasions. Only once (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight's coronation</span>) have they ever sported a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">Pimped-Out Dress</a>  in Cadance's case, twice, the other was her own wedding.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight Sparkle</span> is the same way, once she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes an alicorn princess as well</span>. She won't even wear her crown unless it's a special occasion, and even then it's a very small and simple model; she completely forgoes any other regalia. In fact, her crowns get progressively simpler; her original crown as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bearer of the Element of Harmony</span> was more ornate than the one she wore at her coronation, despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both containing her Element</span>. When she wears a dress, rest assured that it has nothing to do with her social standing. She didn't even have a castle at first, preferring to continue living <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the library</span> and only leaving because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it got blown up.</span>
</li><li> This trope must run in the family, as Twilight's older brother Shining Armor, a prince by marriage to the aforementioned Cadance, has never once been shown with a crown, only wearing a royal red tunic on very rare formal occasions. He once introduced himself to a tourist, whom they thought was an important Equestria Games instructor, merely by name rather than title.
</li></ul></li><li> Bloom from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> is far more comfortable being a regular girl than a princess. Justified in that she was raised as a regular girl and didn't know she was a princess until some time later.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>, Princess Amalia has relatively fancy clothes, but prefers walking around barefoot in minimal clothing when traveling. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yugo's outfit is also pretty casual for the king of the Eliatropes (though he's unaware of that for most of the series).</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> is this entirely by necessity; like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> example above, he is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">Warrior Prince</a> of Japan, and by default, the Emperor since his father is dead.

Aside from being the head of the family there's really no indication that she's royalty—she wears the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyHolidaysDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyHolidaysDress">red-and-white outfit</a> as the others, lives in their cottage, and presumably used to work with them as a toymaker for the (human) king.

<ul><li> Many Islamic Caliphs embody this trope. One that comes to mind is Hazrat Umar Ibn Khattab, who despite commanding one of the most terrifyingly powerful armies in the world at that time and ruling one of the most powerful empires ever to be wrought on Earth, would go out among the empire at night in common clothing with a sack of corn and would give it in charity among the poor. One telling instance was after the Muslims conquered Jerusalem, Umar was holding the reins of his camel while his servant rode upon it. Upon seeing this, the Patriarch of Jerusalem was said to declare: <em>verily, Islam has excelled over all other religions.</em> Umar is also said to have shouted at the men who took the city for wearing garish clothing and gold, accusing them of abandoning the simplicity of the Holy Prophet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> basically had one rule: if you would drink and feast with him, you were all right. His court was basically one constant party, and it didn't end there. He would insist friends join him while he bathed, so that they could keep reveling. He was basically the most outgoing, boisterous monarch in Europe. His easygoing attitude extended to his family: although he was seemingly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a> respecting his daughters (only one was allowed to marry, and he refused to feast unless all of them <em>and</em> their brothers who weren't out on kingdom business were present), he had absolutely no problem with them having numerous affairs and even children by various courtiers. Or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse">Larry Gonick</a> put it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Charlemagne:</strong> (<em>mouth full, pointing</em>) Cute lil' bastard! Pass the roast!
</div></li><li> While coronations are usually lavish affairs, King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia had a very understated one, not wanting to put his financially-devastated nation under further strain with a fancy ceremony. He doesn't even have a crown: the ancient crown of Cambodia disappeared during the reign of the Khmer Rouge, and he decided against having a new one made despite the unlikelihood of the original crown even existing any more.
</li><li> King Sejong of Korea drove most of the yangban <em>nuts</em> with this (among other things—he just didn't share their classism). When he was required for an official meeting or the like, yes he'd put on the regalia. But if not, why bother with the attendant expense of repair and cleaning for the extra-expensive garb? Just wear what was comfortable. The traditionalists among the yangban, meanwhile, were irritated that Sejong wasn't keeping himself steeped in the gravity proper to a king.
</li><li> Władysław Jagiełło, Grand Duke of Lithuania and eventually King of Poland dressed in black and grey. Sometimes he even wore sheepskin coat. At the same time he never drank alcohol, he shaved and bathed every day. In the beginning of fifteenth century! <br/><br/>According to the legend, when Princess of Poland, Saint Hedwig, was about to marry him, she was afraid that he is more like a hairy beast, as said Teutonic Knights' propaganda. She sent a her courtier to check out the truth. The future king predicted these concerns and invited him to the steambath where he could see that the Lithuanian monarch is no monster at all.
</li><li> While other monarchs of his day wore fancy clothing (silk, lace, brocade, what have you), Frederick William I of Prussia put on a simple officer's uniform all the time (at that time there were no badges of rank, so an ensign and a general of the same regiment wore the same kind of uniform). His son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> followed his example, going even further by usually wearing the even simpler off-duty version most of the time. This set a trend for other European monarchs of the late 18th and 19th century. During and after the Napoleonic Wars, some of the most powerful monarchs in Europe, such as Frederick William III of Prussia and Francis I of Austria, tended to dress simply and favoured a lifestyle that was "bourgeois" with some military elements (Frederick William for instance would always sleep in a field bed).
</li><li> William I of Prussia (since 1871 German Emperor), who had served in the Napoleonic Wars as a teenager, also favoured a somewhat Spartan military lifestyle, considering even underpants an effete luxury. When Victoria, the Princess Royal (eldest child and daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">the British monarch</a>), married Crown Prince Frederick William (later Emperor Frederick III), she was shocked by how "primitive" the facilities in the Prussian palaces were.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Emperor</a> of the French, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> almost always wore a simple field uniform with a couple medals, and on the field would add gray greatcoat and an undecorated bicorn hat. Ironically, that served to make him stand out near the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> of his marshals. It is said that one of his biggest errors of judgment during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days">Hundred Days<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was when he deviated from this during the ceremony on the Champ de Mars on 1 June 1815 for the signature of the act to amend the Imperial constitution and put on majestic monarchical finery, which did not help his image at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> enjoyed the finer things - but she enjoyed them because she <em>enjoyed</em> them, and took a childlike delight in merrymaking (she could dance for hours in a night); whether or not things looked splendid was less important to her then whether or not they were fun. She usually talked with the accent of a Vienna housewife, and kept an easy-going and unpretentious court - for a Habsburg, anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic">Her descendant, Franz Joseph</a>, echoing the Napoleonic era, lived a regimented, almost Spartan routine carried over from days in the military - to the point that even his quarters in the Hofburg in Vienna had little more than the bare essentials of the time.
</li><li> Contrary to popular imagery, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> preferred simpler muslin shifts over powdered wigs, pastel satin and big frilly skirts. This caused a major scandal before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>.
</li><li> Despite his incredible wealth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun">Attila the Hun</a> was known for living simply. According to Priscus, a Byzantine historian who visited him as a member of a diplomatic mission, he wore simple clothes, ate from wooden dishes and did not adorn his sword with gold or gems.
</li><li> A notable example was Louis IX (later canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church for his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">Crusades</a>" in North Africa), whose rather humble personality is recorded in the memoirs of his friend Jean de Joinville. St Louis preferred to hold the royal court under a tree in the royal garden as opposed to an official room. He also often invited his lords to sit next to him on the steps by the royal throne to converse on state matters. This is also a slight deconstruction, as although Louis appears to have been a great guy, his modesty made his officials somewhat uncomfortable, as they preferred stricter hierarchy.
</li><li> The Dutch &amp; Danish Royal Families are known for this.
<ul><li> Queen Juliana used to ride her bicycle from her residence to her office.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rnw.org/archive/faq-dutch-royalty">Dutch Royal Family's FAQs page (in English)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> describes, for example that "The Dutch don't coronate or 'crown' their monarch, but inhuldigen (install) them. It's an event similar to the inauguration of a President. The current monarch, Queen Beatrix, was inaugurated in 1980". Additionally, the monarch and members of the royal family pay income tax as well as taxes on assets that are not exempted by the Royal House Finances Act. But what truly stands out is the following quote:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Question:</strong> Where can I see the crown jewels?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Answer:</strong> Since there is none, you can't. The royal family, as an institution, doesn't own any crown jewels.
</div><ul><li> The current Dutch monarch, King Willem-Alexander, does sometimes wear a uniform. He's fully qualified to fly the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, and about twice a month walks through Schiphol Airport to report for duty in his KLM jacket and cap, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">is rarely recognized</a>.
</li><li> It's a particularly old tradition for the Danish royals: Christian IX was a minor noble who only became heir to the Danish throne by agreement between the Great Powers after both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a> <em>and</em> the backup Heir Club for Women started scraping the bottom of the barrel. As a result, his only income was his /year<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15pwd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15pwd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15pwd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">About $160,000 in 2013 US dollars</span> officer's salary from the Danish Army (enough to live comfortably, but hardly the amount usual for a royal), and he lived with his wife and two daughters in a relatively small house in Copenhagen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2m8st');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2m8st" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2m8st');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though called a "palace", it was actually just a large townhouse some burgher had built and the Royal Family bought up and called a palace</span>—in other words, he lived more like an upper-middle-class professional than as the heir to the throne. The daughters shared a room and made their own clothes growing up, which proved a stunning contrast to their later lives: the elder, Alexandra, married a fellow named Albert Edward who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">happened to be the Prince of Wales</a>, while the younger, Dagmar, married the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Russian Tsar</a> (her son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanovsAndRevolutions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RomanovsAndRevolutions">met an</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">unfortunate end</a>).
</li><li> The Dutch monarchs' tradition of simplicity is also rooted, for good reason: until 1815, they weren't even monarchs, but nobles who "happened" to always be elected <em>stadtholder</em> (commander-in-chief of the armed forces/chief magistrate) of most (but seldom all) of the Provinces of the Dutch Republic. As a result, they never quite got into the whole "I'm a king!" thing. (This, incidentally, is one of the main reasons why the English let <em>stadtholder</em> Prince William of Orange become King of England in 1688: having been head of state in a constitutional republic, he would know his place as head of state in a constitutional monarchy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note378py');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note378py" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note378py');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The other major reasons were (1) royal genetics/family ties (he was married to James II's daughter Mary and was himself a grandson of Charles I in the female line), (2) religion (he and Mary were Protestant), and (3) Dutch business expertise (the Dutch had invented central banking and made improvements to paper money, shipping insurance, and financial instruments; the English hoped closer ties to the Dutch would establish or improve those things in England.)</span>)
</li></ul></li><li> The modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily">British royal family</a> doesn't get much more dressed up than business formal, except for truly pomp-inducing ceremonies like a royal wedding or coronation (although there hasn't been one of those since 1953). Even Prince Charles' investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969 (when he was 21) was an understated affair, with his mother in a white hat and dress/overcoat thing and the Prince himself in military uniform.
<ul><li> Queen Elizabeth, being the monarch, wears the Imperial State Crown and her full regalia for her annual speech before the Parliament.
</li><li> This extends to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRoyalGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRoyalGuards">British Royal Guards</a>; their iconic uniforms might be rather elaborate or impractical by the standards of contemporary combat uniforms, but compared to something like <a class="urllink" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rom,_Vatikan,_Soldat_der_Schweizer_Garde_3.jpg">the Pontifical Swiss Guard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> Parade Dress uniform<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note48fnq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note48fnq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note48fnq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the one they wear for ceremonial duties; the Swiss Guard have an alternate, still-anachronistic but much less elaborate working uniform for everyday wear</span>, a red tunic, black trousers and boots and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">bearskin</a> are positively austere.
</li></ul></li><li> Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III was noted to wear a basic uniform of the Royal Italian Army (that under him had been made very plain for practical reasons) every time he could get away with it.
<ul><li> His son Umberto II, the last King of Italy, took after him, wearing the uniform during his rule and a simple business suit after abdicating.
</li></ul></li><li> In China, this was actually a requirement for a good Confucian ruler. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucius</a> is quoted in <em>The Analects</em> as saying that the higher up the (meritocratic) social ladder one goes, the fewer times one should eat during the day: commoners should eat several times a day, while the emperor should eat only once. Chinese historians view very favourably emperors who lived modestly and were open to criticism.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope Francis</a> showed up in the Italian newspapers pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">Pope Incognito</a> in the simple black trousers, black dress shirt and clerical collar of a rank-and-file priest while working a night-shift in a soup kitchen. This seems to be the mark of Francis's papacy in general; a humble man that calls out his subordinate clergy for spending lavishly (he fired one bishop for spending a million dollars to tile a floor). He's even written <em>a children's book</em>.
</li><li> It has been common for communist military dictators to wear the uniform of the lowest-ranking private, without insignia or decorations - Mao, Stalin (though the latter dropped this habit after World War 2 and started to wear a white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform">Custom Uniform</a> made for him specially). For fascist rulers, Hitler's toothbrush moustache stood in contrast to the extravagant facial hair of the old German upper classes. A royal monarch, being the "font of honour", carried no honours themselves aside from being king or queen.
</li><li> Prince Svyatoslav I of Kiev. Despite being the ruler of Kievan Rus (though he left most of political affairs to his mother Olga) and one of the most accomplished military commanders of his time, he wore a simple white clothes and slept and ate along with his warriors. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor did he have a tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise. He wore simple white clothes and the only signs of him being royalty were his hairstyle, his clothes being cleaner, and a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Emperor</a> Basil II "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent">the Bulgar Slayer</a>" lived like a soldier to the point of eating the same daily rations as his troops.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">Marcus Aurelius</a> made a point of keeping his living area relatively simple, seeing material wealth as a distraction from his duties as Emperor.
</li><li> During the 2020 covid pandemic, princess Sofia of Sweden works as a volunteer hospital orderly, whereas her husband prince Carl Philip has reported for regular military duty at the Defence Staff HQ. He is a major of the naval infantry reserve by field service, not by birth. No particular fuss about the matter.
