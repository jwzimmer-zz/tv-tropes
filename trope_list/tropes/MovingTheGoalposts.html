However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract">Alice has much more power than Bob, because Bob is really desperate for whatever Alice is offering</a>, and will do whatever it takes to get it. Alice ends up abusing this power badly, reneging on the initial agreement and making a seemingly endless series of demands on Bob without ever keeping her end of the bargain. Each time Bob fulfills her requirements, she simply adds another one. If he protests, she threatens to withdraw her offer entirely. This is Moving The Goalposts.
</p><p>For example, Bob wants a promotion. Alice, his boss, says that he'll be promoted if he succeeds in closing a particularly important deal. Bob lands the deal... but Alice tells him that, though it was impressive, the deal didn't bring in as much money as she forecasted, so Bob needs to bring in a couple of big clients. Bob does... and then Alice tells him that he hasn't attended an important course, and he needs to complete the course before he's eligible for promotion. And on it goes.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This set up can end in a number of ways. Sometimes, just to add insult to injury, Alice will manipulate Bob until she gets bored or has everything she needs, then tells Bob sorry, but it'll never happen (e.g. someone else has been given the promotion that Bob's been chasing). Sometimes this will result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> and some well-deserved retribution. Alternatively, Alice will develop a conscience (or a third party will hammer one into her) and finally live up to her promise. A third option is that Bob will decide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">Celebrity Is Overrated</a> and no reward is worth endless, humiliating, and unappreciated labor, which, ironically, may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes">lead to Alice finally letting him have the now-worthless bargaining chip</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tales</a>, the king setting Impossible Tasks may eventually decide it's not worth it, but, usually, one of the tasks backfires on him. Badly.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">Blackmail</a> version of this trope, where the powerful party keeps his word — more or less — but makes it clear that he could change his mind at any time. Murder mysteries that involve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole">death of a blackmailer</a> usually cite this as a motive: the blackmailer made an initial demand that was met, but soon realized that they had their victim trapped, and kept making additional demands until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">victim decided</a> the only way to get free was to kill their tormentor. Military/political agreements where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">one force is stronger than the other</a> often have this connotation to them: a one-off favor might be used to bully the weaker country or politician into supporting the stronger, whether they like it or not. Indeed, it can be a problem with any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract">Leonine Contract</a>.
</p><p>The effect on the viewer depends on whose side they're on. If they like the weaker partner of the deal, it can be hugely frustrating to see them strung along like this (expect to be yelling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a> fairly loudly). If their sympathies lie with the more powerful half, though, it can be used as slapstick humor. If the roles are usually reversed (Bob is Alice's boss, for example), it can be used to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">bossy or overbearing character</a> their comeuppance.
</p><p>On the odd occasion, Alice might have genuinely good intentions. Maybe Bob wants Alice to introduce him to Alice's pretty coworker, who Alice knows is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bitch</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>, so she tries to deter Bob from the girl without saying outright that she's bad news because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">she knows Bob wouldn't believe her</a>.
</p><p>There also exists a situation that looks like this, but isn't: the proposed item fulfills the stated requirements, but not the unstated ones. For example, offering a reward for the head of a Gunslinger, but forgetting to add "unattached to his body". Or asking for a polite courtier, and getting one who delights in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">stealth insults</a> and backhanded compliments.
</p><p>"Moving the goal posts" can also be used to describe a debate 'tactic' (read: fallacy). In this scenario, essentially Alice will make a point and/or demand evidence to counter his argument. Bob provides evidence or a counter argument to Alice's original argument. Alice then dismisses the evidence and/or demands further evidence on grounds which were not introduced or required in the original point and which may only be tangentially linked to Alice's original point, if indeed they are linked at all. For example, Alice claims that there's no product that easily kills fleas on cats. Bob directs her to a product which does so, only for Alice to then dismiss Bob's point by claiming that the product in question doesn't kill fleas on cats <em>and</em> on dogs. (Although it should be added that non-fallacious "goalpost moving" exists, when the original standard is realized to be incomplete in some way; to expand on the above example, Alice would be a lot more justified in her objection if she dismissed Bob's claim because the product in question killed both fleas <em>and cats</em>.)

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, a village hosts a race: whoever arrives first wins an all-expenses-paid trip to a spring resort of their choosing (including the Cursed Springs that gave the main character his curse and also has the cure). However, the village doesn't actually <em>have</em> the money to pay for the trip, so they place increasingly dangerous obstacles on the course to dissuade everyone from finishing, finally resorting, when everything else fails, to two villagers literally lifting the goal and carry it away from the approaching racers.
</li><li> The villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em> like doing this.

The most infamous case is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mystery writer Daisuke Torakura</span>.

Up to this point, she's been winning every one-on-one fight she's been in; then her creditor, who also owns the arena she fights in to make money, straight-up changes the rules and has her fight two guys at once, to ensure she'll never be rid of him. She beats them handily (with a little help from Coud and the gang), and then apparently beats the creditor to death backstage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful">The World is Still Beautiful</a></em>, Nike's grandmother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">offers Livius a deal: find a key she tossed into a swamp to release Nike from her prison and she will let them be together. However, the swamp can be truly dangerous if the weather is really bad with lots of rain. Livius takes all but five seconds to look at the woman who trained Nike to control the weather and use a profane word against her. So, it's not the goal that is moved, but the terrain to the goalposts</span>.
</li><li> Professor Chronos/Crowler did this a lot in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> in his attempts to humiliate, discredit, and expel Judai/Jaden whom he took an instant dislike to. Each time, it came back to bite him:
<ul><li> As early as the first episode, Chronos compromised the rules by handling Judai's entrance exam himself with his personal deck (rather than the test decks the other instructors used). Judai won, humiliating him publicly, and it only led to Chronos becoming obsessed in his goal.
</li><li> The second major time was during an exam where he first cut in line and bought every one of the new shipment of cards. (Or so he thought.) He then gave those cards to Manjyome/Chazz, told him to build a stronger deck, and then manipulated the exam placement so Manjyome would duel Judai. It didn't work (Judai had gained an upgraded version of Winged Kuriboh after stopping to help Tome-san) and <em>this</em> time, not only was <em>he</em> humiliated, so was Manjyome. It is hinted Samejima got wise to Chronos in this episode, and offered Judai a promotion. (Which he turned down.) Naturally, he would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blame this entirely on Manjyome later.</a>
</li><li> Chronos would later foil Judai's attempt to file a request to Kaiser (stating in the dub that such requests had to be done in triplicate with a number 2 pencil; even Judai was suspicious of <em>that</em> excuse). Ironically, Judai managed to duel Kaiser by asking personally, and while the duel likely had the result Chronos would desire (Kaiser won), Judai won Kaiser's respect, potentially robbing Chronos of the support of the most influential student.

The captain in charge of the final stage of the project retaliated by sending memos to the admiral's superiors mentioning her concerns about the test parameters, which would presumably lead to the higher-ups looking at the results of <em>all</em> the tests, rather than just the one where the LACs failed, and realizing that they lost because the admiral stacked the deck.

Ideally, the women work off the cost of the transportation by doing anything requested (surprisingly, non-sexual but involving manual labor) until the obligation is worked off, and the woman is free to marry an Imperial citizen (she herself cannot become a citizen, but her children can). Unfortunately, over the centuries, this has caused all women (both free and those under obligations) to be treated as second-class citizens and gave enormous power to the Honourable New Britain Company that holds these obligations. The titular destroyermen quickly pointed out the obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> — a holder of an obligation may simply move his obligated women from one island to another, constantly increasing their obligations by the cost of the journey (see similar examples in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section below).

The show was based on asking each contestant a 'skill testing question' which had to be answered correctly both to win a prize and to avoid facing the 'consequence' of appearing in some mildly embarrassing stunt for the audience. The questions tended to be trivial, but obscure. In the rare event that a contestant answered correctly, the MC Bob Barker would reach into his pocket and reveal that it was really a two part question. In at least one case a third part had to be revealed. It would have been a nice touch for the producers to have turned the tables on Bob by planting a contestant that could answer very many questions, perplexing him until the contestant pointed out the cameras and gave him a birthday present.

The limit was introduced in "The Deadly Assassin" as a major plot point, but it effectively backed future writers into a corner because it meant the Doctor was subject to this regeneration cap, and thanks to a slew of actors who didn't hold tenures as the Doctor for very long on TV due to either personal reasons that urged them to pass the torch or having their runs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a>, and a couple of major plot twists that accelerated the time table two whole regenerations, it fast-forwarded the Doctor to the end of his limit.

<ul><li> This is how Jacob ended up with two wives. Laban had two daughters, and Jacob fell in love with the younger one, Rachel. The father agreed to let Jacob marry her if he worked on Laban's land for seven years. Jacob obliged. At the end of his agreement, Laban snuck the elder daughter, Leah, into bed with Jacob in the dark of night, and in the morning claimed that he couldn't possibly let the younger daughter marry before the elder. He gave Rachel to Jacob shortly after in exchange for another seven years' labor (bet the daughters were really grateful to dear old dad for this set-up), so Jacob continued working. He ended up walking off with almost half of Laban's possessions at the end of twenty years.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4350z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4350z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4350z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's worth noting that Laban was Jacob's uncle.

As for the twenty years bit, after Jacob had worked for 14 years for his wives, he stayed with Laban as a contractor for six years, wherein Jacob would not be paid any cash, but they would divide the flock between them according to certain features on the sheep (whatever sheep had a certain feature would go to Jacob). Again, Laban tried to swindle Jacob by interfering with his ability to breed sheep that would bear the features that would go to him as his payment. This ends up backfiring.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> In some tellings, the reason Hercules had Twelve Labors is because the king invalidated two labors (cleaning the Augean Stables and slaying the hydra) for technicalities. In the case of the hydra, he had Iolaus help him by burning the neck-stumps, so Hercules hadn't performed the labor alone. In the case of the stables, it was disqualified either because he was paid for the job, or because he did it by redirecting a river and therefore "the river did the work".

<ul><li> The occasional match with special rules tied to a heel wrestler that change on the fly whenever they appear to lose. This way, it's virtually impossible for the face to win, given how far the heel takes the gimmick.
<ul><li> The best known example is probably William Regal's win over Chris Jericho at WWF Backlash 2001 under "Duchess of Queensbury Rules", which suddenly had a round system, no submissions, and a no disqualification rule announced as soon as Regal "lost" by pinfall, submission, and disqualification respectively. Regal eventually won after hitting Y2J with a chair and pinning him.
</li><li> At WCW New Blood Rising in 2000, Lance Storm defended his Canadian (née United States) Heavyweight Championship belt against Mike Awesome under "Canadian Rules", with guest Canadian referee Jacques Rougeau conveniently relaying new rules to the announcer whenever Awesome seemed to win. These included a 5 count for pinfalls, no submissions, a boxing-style 10 count to get up after a pinfall, and a "last man standing" 10 count if both wrestlers are out. Rougeau himself knocked out Awesome in the latter instance to ensure that only Storm answered the count, much to the approval of the crowd in Vancouver, British Columbia, <em>Canada</em>.

They promptly get taken right back to Bowser's Castle again. Even when you finally rescue the princesses, Bowser and his paper counterpart are still at large, and moves his castle to a new location, forcing the bros. on another scramble to reach it to put a stop to their plans for good.

First, she tells you to get to the top of an inclined plane without taking any damage. You will fail this part repeatedly because the game doesn't adequately explain how to strafe, the specific control scheme is ONLY used in that area, and you can't attack. When you reach the top, she sends 30-ish enemies at you and expects you to defeat them without any attacks landing successfully on you (you can block attacks and deflect arrows as usual). Fail here, and you have to do the first part again. Only thing saving it from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> is that once you deal with the enemies, Tachibane concedes that you're actually strong and doesn't make you fight her.

The quota is low first, but it's likely that as soon your industry begins to run, he makes an excuse to demand more. He mercifully stops after a while, allowing you to complete the mission. If you know this is coming (one of the level hints points out that the Snake isn't trustworthy, but that's it), you can stockpile a large amount of hops before you start brewing ale. If you subsequently make enough brewers, you can complete his task before he moves the goalposts, but it's tough.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em>, you need to free a captain so that you can sail to the next town. The guards want you to pay his fine: 100 Monetari. If you try to pay the fine, they up the fine to some amount slightly larger than the amount of Monetari you have on hand, and will continue to do this if you come back with more. The only way to free the man is to track down a cache of gold bars. This can make the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnWinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnWinnable">Unwinnable</a> or cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> depending on what you do with the gold bars. If you convert the bullion into Monetari, the guards will just up the fine again. If you offer to pay in bullion, the guards will take all of your bullion and free the captain. If you drop all but one of the bars, you can free the captain, reclaim the rest of the bullion, and have more than enough money for the rest of the game. This was mercilessly lampshaded in Nakar's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of the game.

So when the mods started changing the amounts Liam and Ruby owed, fans furiously tried to meet the new goals, which changed again and again to mounting outrage, until the event ended... and Liam and Ruby <em>opened new shops</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">like the admin had been planning the whole time</a>.
<ul><li> The 2009 Christmas event had the depowered demigods attempting to build an airship so they could run Christmas while Santa was missing-in-action.

A variation on the same also appeared, with an alleged young couple threatening to have an abortion unless they received enough donations. In both cases, either the amount asked for, or the time in which to donate the money was increased.

The catch is that Porky must get a black eye in a ridiculously specific accident, occurring as a result of a stampede of wild elephants in his own living room on the Fourth of July — of any year — between the hours of 3:55 and 4 P.M. during a hail storm. Sure enough, as soon as Porky agrees to the policy, he gets into an accident that meets these requirements and gets a black eye from it. As Porky tells Daffy to pay up, Daffy quickly adds that the policy actually specifies a stampede of wild elephants <em>and</em> one baby zebra, making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideComment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideComment">Aside Comment</a>, "I just added that one." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Then a baby zebra runs in.</a>

<ul><li> Corporations in the 19th century would set up "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">Company Towns</a>" with "Company Stores" where the employees could get ridiculously easy credit. This had hideous interest, plus the rent and inflated prices all put the employees in a state of perpetual debt. Since the debt was to their employer, in effect they were just handing in their wage packets and couldn't save anything. This inevitably led to riots, conspiracies, mass murders, and the formation of labor unions. Adding insult to injury, many companies paid their employees' wages not with real money, but with "credit scrips" which couldn't be used anywhere <em>except</em> in the company stores.
<ul><li> Referenced in the song "Sixteen Tons," about the trials and tribulations of a coal miner: "You load sixteen tons, and what do you get? / Another day older and deeper in debt / St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go / I owe my soul to the Company Store."
</li></ul></li><li> Tacit support from the Secret Police was the chief reasons why socialist parties like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">the Russian Communist Party</a> easily got support of factory workers in the larger cities of the Russian Empire. They had a habit of funding the enemies they liked most, including the Bolshevik faction of the Communist party, on the grounds that only a tiny minority of people (said urban workers were less than 3% of the total population) wanted to implement their policies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Though very few people truly agreed with their values, the Bolsheviks also well-organised and militant</a>.
</li><li> Until 2009, credit card companies in America were free to raise the interest rate on <em>existing balances</em> at any time, for any reason. You could get a credit card with a 4.9% interest rate, buy a $1,000 item with it, make two months' worth of minimum payments to reduce your balance to $980 — and then credit card company could raise the interest rate to 19.9% on the entire remaining $980 balance. Not even variable interest rate mortgages have that kind of abusive power (their interest rates have to be tied to government-controlled indices).
</li><li> In the US Army, this can happen for enlisted promotions. The promotion lists are based on cut-off scores - if you have more points than the cut-off score, you're eligible for promotion. This is a constantly-moving line; when the Army doesn't need any more of a particular rank in a particular field, they set the score to be higher than the number of points obtainable in that rank/field. For example, if you've gotten every point possible, say 800 points, the Army may set the cut-off to 801 points, knowing good and well that this means no one will be promoted.
<ul><li> In one case in the early 1990s, a senior enlisted promotion board met and needed to eliminate some of the otherwise-qualified candidates for promotions. After going through the records of every candidate, the board determined that all of them were more or less equal. The promotion board then decided to eliminate any candidate who had a mustache in his official photo. Surely, no one in the Army was aware that a promotion may hinge on the presence or absence of facial hair.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens in the trucking industry, including garbage collection. The company decides that in order to justify paying you a certain amount of money, you have to collect a certain amount of garbage per week). If you start approaching that limit, they then determine that you're capable of collecting more, and raise the amount of trash they expect you to collect. Which means you go from collecting, say, 98% of your total amount to closer to 90% (while still collecting the same weight) - and, since you're now only collecting 90% of what they say you can collect, they're immediately cutting your pay since obviously you must be slacking off.
</li><li> An actual incident in the government siege of Mount Carmel (recording appearing in the documentary <em>Waco: The Rules of Engagement</em>): David Koresh, on the phone to an FBI spokesman, complains of a helicopter firing at them. The spokesman first asserts "there were no guns on that helicopter", then "there were no guns <em>mounted</em> on that helicopter", finally that there may have been a gun or two mounted, but nobody fired it.
</li><li> Jack Thompson wrote a "Modest Video Game Proposal", wherein he promised to donate $10,000 to a charity of the choosing of Paul Eibeler (then-chairman of Take-Two Interactive, publisher of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> and target of Thompson's ire) for the creation of a video game involving the player going on a killing spree against people in the gaming industry. Such a game was made, in the form of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImOK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImOK">I'm O.K</a></em>. Thompson reneged on his end of the deal, though, saying the game had to be published and sold commercially. Thankfully, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> jumped to the rescue, donating the 10K in Jack's name to the Entertainment Software Association Foundation Charity "<em>for Jack Thompson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">because Jack Thompson won't</a></em>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">And then Jack Thompson tried to sue them for it.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorists</a> are absurdly fond of this. When pressed, they will claim that they don't have to prove their theories correct, they only have to poke holes in the official story (see the point above).
<ul><li> For example, they will insist that the NIST simulation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">9/11 World Trade center collapse</a> is incorrect because it doesn't show <em>exactly</em> what happened. Never mind that the rest of their reasoning holds up, or that precisely simulating the billions of pieces of furniture and fittings and individual components of the building would be impossible on any computer known to man, even if they somehow knew their exact locations.

Some now claim that it was some combination of some variant of thermite <em>and</em> explosives, despite the fact that this has all the flaws of both theories (lacking both the loud bangs of explosives <em>and</em> the bright flashes of thermite).
</li></ul></li><li> Famous anecdote from philosophy: When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Plato</a> gave Socrates' definition of man as "featherless bipeds" and was much praised for this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">Diogenes</a> plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." After this incident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">"with broad flat nails" was added to Plato's definition</a>.
</li><li> Attempting to fudge the results of a wargame, exercise, or test of a new piece of equipment when it doesn't come out the way someone wants has a long and inglorious tradition in many militaries.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002">Millennium Challenge 2002 wargame<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was when Lt. Gen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Paul van Riper</a> publicly accused the organizers of scripting the event to ensure a US victory and that the entire point of the challenge had shifted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">reinforce existing notions that the US military was infallible</a> after his unconventional tactics, playing the technologically inferior enemy force, sank the US fleet in two days (which were arbitrarily refloated to restart the exercise and had the rules changed so they were untouchable) and prevented communication interception by using couriers instead of radio or telephone (which had the rules changed so he wasn't allowed to do it), accusing the organizers of forcing him into using tactics which made the opposition mincemeat for American weapons and tactics (in particular being ordered to turn on anti-aircraft radars solely so they could be targeted and destroyed, and at one point even demanding the arbitrary revelation of where his forces were). On the other hand, van Riper himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">abusing holes in the simulation's rules</a> to do clearly impossible things, like creating magical teleporting bike couriers that delivered their messages as fast as radio but could not be intercepted by normal means because they were not radio communications, mounting 5-ton anti-ship missile launchers onto small speedboats that couldn't carry them, and deploying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">a frankly obscene number of them</a>. All this on top of the fact that the Millennium Challenge was about <em>practicing a naval invasion</em>, so for logistical purposes (as well as to not overly block naval trade) the fleet was <em>several times</em> closer to shore than normal and not using its radar systems. The articles reporting on the wargame (including a chapter of <em>Blink</em>) show just how much the event was $250 million wasted.
</li><li> British military manoeuvres in the late 1920's were designed, by advocates such as Liddell-Hart and Fuller, to test the proposition that the massive losses of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW1">WW 1</a> could be greatly diminished in future wars by using an integrated all-arms force, including a preponderance of tanks supprted by aircraft, to smash through the enemy line using concentrated strength focused on its weakest point. The military theoreticians assembled and trained an experimental, 100% mechanised, Experimental Mobile Force to prove this point. Generals who saw <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW1">WW1</a> as an abberation and who wanted to return to pre-1914 tactics as if the war had never happened, were appalled when the EMF did everything asked of it and more. Subsequent manouevres had the parameters changed to demonstrate, for instance, that horsed cavalry was the true war-winning weapon, and the EMF was disbanded with its revolutionary self-propelled artillery scrapped altogether. General Fuller and Colonel Liddell-Hart resigned from the army in disgust and despair, and the only people who absorbed the lesson and took notes were the invited military observers from Germany.
</li><li> When the V-22 Osprey aircraft failed to be able to autorotate<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note79eer');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note79eer" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note79eer');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this allows a helicopter to crash land as the air flows through the rotor blades and causes them to spin, slowing its descent</span> as the wings would get in the way, this requirement was dropped. The above requirement is worse for the V-22 than a conventional helicopter because if one completely unarmored engine loses power and the cross link fails, the aircraft will immediately roll over and crash. Other important features were dropped or decided to no longer be important as weight requirements grew and the designers realized that rotors and propellers are different for a reason and designing a hybrid doesn't work as effectively. These important features include armor and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection, for an aircraft that is expected to be an assault transport. Relating to the above it is also incapable of carrying weapons as those exceed the already tight weight requirements.
</li><li> The OICW project was subject to this sort of thing too. When it became clear that the XM29 prototype failed to meet <em>any</em> of the requirements (weight, cost, or effectiveness versus the existing M16 with M203), the prototype was shelved and the project continued into "Increments" that would have developed both parts of the weapon separately and <em>then</em> combined them to create the full OICW. They were only willing to move the goalposts so far in this case, however - when the XM8, the result of "Increment One", not only again failed to meet weight requirements but also had a host of other issues<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8y8v9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8y8v9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8y8v9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the plastic casing of the initial models would often melt under sustained fire, fouling up the action and preventing the gun from continuing to fire; the built-in optics of said initial models had a short battery life; and most revisions of the weapon were incompatible with existing accessories, due to using a proprietary "PCAP" system instead of Picatinny rails the Army'd been using for ten years at that point</span>, the project was shelved indefinitely. Meanwhile "Increment Two", the XM25, continued standalone testing for its airbursting properties.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9k1kx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9k1kx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9k1kx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It interestingly ended up falling to the opposite sort of problem, where after a <em>single</em> one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">misfired</a> and injured the user, the <em>entire project</em> had its funding cut <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">as if this were an inherent problem every single example was subject to</a>.</span>
</li><li> The F-35 Lightning II has been infamous for this sort of thing, being pushed further forward into full-scale production (including onto several US allies) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy">solely to make up for the exorbitant costs of its existing development and production</a>. Most notable is the July 2015 demonstration, where the USMC declared the F-35B to meet initial operational capability, despite the actual results of the demonstration very clearly showing that it was <em>nowhere</em> near ready, including shortcomings in night operations and with its communications, flight software, and weapons-carriage abilities.
</li><li> The Stryker infantry vehicle was supposed to be air transportable in a C-130 and be able to fight within minutes of rolling out of the plane. This was achieved, but only after the fuel, ammunition, and the infantry themselves were put in a second plane. The weight tolerances also meant the plane's flight range was so short as to be worthless. The Army Secretary's admission of defeat was "well we wanted the engineers to think along these lines even if they didn't achieve the goal."
</li></ul></li><li> When the Wright Brothers snubbed the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, founded in France in 1905 to verify aviation records, by refusing to travel to France and demonstrate their flying machine for them, they added rules that an aircraft should be able to take off under its own power in order to qualify for a record. Thus they were able to discount the Wright Brothers' aircraft, which had been flying for more than a year at that point, because it reportedly used a system employing a falling weight to launch it along rails until it reached takeoff speed, and allowed them to claim that Alberto Santos-Dumont, a Brazilian-born Frenchman, was "really" the first man to fly. No one outside of France and Brazil cared, and they themselves have since stamped the Wright Brothers as the first to fly a heavier-than-air craft successfully.
<ul><li> This all came to a head during a 1908 competition in France, when an FAI judge disqualified a new time to altitude record set by the Wright Brothers because they had used a catapult. The Wrights responded by repeating their feat without it, and getting an even faster time in the process. The Wrights then revealed that the catapult was just a safety measure, and they hadn't used it during their first flights anyway. The FAI's response? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur">To rule that the Wright Brother's craft wasn't an "airplane" because it didn't have wheels.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> There is no official YouTube app for Windows Phone. Google says they don't have the resources to devote to making one. Microsoft has said they will build it themselves as long as Google would let them. At first they just didn't let them, then later just repeatedly changed their standards for approval (standards they ignore for their own Android and iOS apps) resulting it in getting pulled every time it's submitted to the store and have to be rewritten from scratch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">It's almost as if they were doing everything in their power to prevent a small competitor from challenging their monopoly.</a>
</li><li> Steve Wozniak attempted this after people challenged his assertion that the Apple was the first personal computer. Wozniak changed the definition of a personal computer to an extremely specific one (built-in keyboard input, video output, capable of being programmed, capable of playing games), which was made to match the capabilities of the Apple. This didn't actually work, since Processor Technology's SOL-20 matched all of his criteria and hit the market first.
</li><li> The video games industry in Spain made it big on 8-bit platforms in the 1980s - an era dubbed the "Golden Age of Spanish Software" - only to slump into decline after it struggled to migrate to 16-bit machines in the early 1990s. This was largely attributed to the policies of Erbe Software, the monopoly distributor in Spain at the time, which dictated that games had to be sold at a cheap fixed price to deter piracy.
</li><li> Before the Civil Rights Act was passed in the 1960s, voter literacy tests in parts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">deliberately designed to be impossible to pass</a>, in order to disenfranchise a large number of voters. And to ensure that <em>only</em> black voters were disenfranchised, these tests were coupled with the trope-naming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a> - if your grandfather was eligible to vote, so are you, regardless of whether you can pass the literacy test.
</li><li> <em>ReactOS</em>, an attempt to implement an open-source OS capable of running Windows programs, has been hit by this from the get-go. It started out as <em>FreeWin95</em> back in 1996 with the goal to implement Windows 95 support. Then it went silent and was revamped into its current form in 1998, with the goal changed to implement Windows NT 4 support. Then it just kept moving forward from there. The team has currently agreed to keep their target locked at implementing Windows XP support to prevent this trope from affecting them further... Only to be forced to move it again to <em>Windows 7</em> support due to pressure from their supporters and sponsors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Affirmative Action standards in Ivy league Universities</a>, in order to encourage African American and Hispanic students to apply, some universities set higher standards for Asians, who tend to score the highest on SAT tests. In October of 2018, William Fitsimmons Dean of admissions at Harvard University, testified that Harvard University has its own standards for SAT scores that account for race and sex. According to Ann Lee, a college preparatory business, African Americans are given a bonus of 230 points on the SAT, Hispanics 185. Asians, meanwhile, are penalized by 50 points. As a school can only have so many students at any one time, Harvard makes it harder for Asian students to get in via the penalty, in order to make room for historically marginalized demographics and achieve the perception of Equality of Outcome.
</li><li> The comments section of Scott Alexanders <a class="urllink" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">Anti-Reactionary FAQ<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was host to a truly bizarre and blatant example of this behavior. A poster named James A. Donald argued that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken">Flawless Token</a> trope was evidence of a vast left-wing conspiracy to promote the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection">blacks are superior to whites, and women are superior to men</a>. When another commenter pointed out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKratman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKratman">Tom Kratman</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a> still sell well, Donald said that Rands works were left alone only to provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a> to the conspiracy, that Kratman was being forced to include female and gay soldiers in his books , and that Ringo was not right-wing by the standard of his time (all of which are false). Donald argued that no female comedian could ever be funny because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">women are always portrayed as wiser than men</a>, and straight-up denied that any of the counterexamples counted, because, for instance, Meredith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em> is popular with her coworkers despite being a slut and not being conventionally attractive (despite the original argument being that she is the butt of jokes).
<ul><li> Donald eventually changed the subject, saying that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> trope proves the media has a misandrist bias, and that black characters on television are never depicted as stereotypical. Donald challenged another poster to name even one competent fictional father, and when someone mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a>s dad, Donald dismissed him for being a minor character (even though he never specified they must be major characters). Then all the Disney fathers were brought up, but he dismissed them for not being on television. When it was pointed out that most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> are black criminals, and thus there is no attempt to hide this fact on television, he said they werent violent enough to count. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> was also dismissed as not having a cast of flawless tokens because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">the shows creator is black</a>. He went on to dismiss <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> for having competent fathers because the show isnt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom">Dom Com</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> because the dad has an affair, and then made the argument that the anti-war stance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> argued that masculinity and fatherhood were evil, citing the circumstances of Irohs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> in the backstory. At this point the other commenters realized he was beyond reason.
</li></ul></li><li> Rather obnoxiously, it's common for far-right people to accuse left leaning people of relying on appeals to emotion instead of using logic and reason. When the people they are arguing with try to cite actual academic and scientific studies as evidence, they then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it away by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">saying it doesn't count since the left is in charge of all the universities and scientific organizations.</a>
</li><li> This is a known tactic of many parents to get their children motivated without actually having to cough up a reward when the goal is achieved. Tends to stop working after a few times, as the kids start assuming that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie">The Cake Is a Lie</a>. Because of this, moving the goal posts is one of the more insidious forms of invisible or unrecognized child abuse: studies have shown that children with parents (especially overly-perfectionist ones) and peers who keep doing this often suffer from serious trust issues and paranoia for the rest of their lives. [Citation needed]
</li><li> If you ever played with other kids as a child, you've probably won some sort of game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">only for the loser to insist "No, let's make it 2 out of 3!"</a> (or "3 out of 5", or "<em>x</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestOutOfInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestOutOfInfinity">out of</a> 2<em>x</em> - 1" where <em>x</em> &gt; 0), with the feeling that if the other person won, they wouldn't be calling an extra round.
