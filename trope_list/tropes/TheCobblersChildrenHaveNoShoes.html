This is seen most often with therapists.
</p><p>It may be justified in the case of therapists because to analyze more effectively, a therapist has to be <em>outside</em> the problem. Think of it like a maze. Is it easier to see the path to the exit in the middle of the maze, or looking down from above? In fact, professional counseling and psychology organizations classify counseling those the therapist has an emotional attachment to as a "dual relationship." They are ethically questionable and always to be avoided in professional work.
</p><p>The same justification can be used for doctors (their emotional attachment can blind them to what's wrong with themselves or those they love, or make them unable to use a risky treatment), so many hospitals have policies that forbid doctors to practice on family members (the exception is when they're the only specialist available, e.g. a venom specialist whose family member just got bitten by a snake). For lawyers, it's not verboten, as it is a legal option, but custom and best practices advise against both self-representation (as in the expression, "A man who represents himself in court has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">A Fool for a Client</a>") and representing family (by the same principle), except in emergency situations.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mcug');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mcug" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mcug');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Typically, this is the situation where you call up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyCousinVinny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyCousinVinny">your cousin</a> and say, "Hi, Vince, I know you're a personal injury plaintiffs' lawyer, but I've been arrested in Jersey and need to convince the judge I'm not a flight risk.

</p><p>If you happen to be wondering why emotional attachment would stop the cobbler repairing his children's shoes, that's not the reason; he's just too busy with the paid work needed to feed everyone. Whats more, especially prior to the industrial revolution, it was often the case that materials were expensive while labor was cheap. As much as hed like to make himself and his family some clothes, furniture, etc. as luxurious as what hed sell to his customers, the artisan wouldnt be making enough of a profit margin on his sales to buy quality materials for a personal project without a customer to foot the bill. Whatever he did make for his household would be much less fancy. Finally, the advent of industrial technology means that hardly any goods can be economically produced without a lot of expensive factories and equipment, and that means that the workers who produce stuff are generally employees rather than owners of the business. Just because somebody works in a factory that makes X doesnt necessarily mean they make high enough wages to afford X.

And really, it's his own damn fault: Garp's status as a high-ranking marine made it so that he was rarely home, and when he was he subjected them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to make them strong marines. When they still reaffirmed their dreams to be pirates, he left them with a friend to turn that around.

Her other children also suffered from the lack of affection/birthday celebrations/Christmas celebrations, etc. and whenever one of their accomplishments, personal or professional, is brought up, she doesn't express any pride or joy because they aren't her accomplishments. Then there is her husband, who borrowed the aforementioned hugging machine. She mentioned that the only times in the marriage that they had sex was to consummate it and for reproduction. His having an affair would indicate that this arrangement was largely her choice, and then the likely lack of affection that plagued the rest of the family. It is all played for laughs, but all evidence indicates that she was/is EXTREMELY emotionally abusive and/or neglectful to her entire family despite being a world-renowned psychologist and parenting expert.

In season 6, he manages to cure Carla of her fear of flying, at the cost of giving himself severe agoraphobia in the process.

The team does have a tendency to profile each other, but while they're great at deconstructing other people's behavior, they miss the emotional signs of those around them. Hotch was unaware of his wife's growing displeasure with his absence from her and their son's life, though it was quite obvious.

Ellie is, amazingly, not dead despite Brass being the one to confront her after she shot her mother; he is currently trying to amend his past by reaching out to a young prostitute who reunited with her father who unfortunately was the victim of the week</span>.

She's barely any better with her patients. Given that she spent over 20 years working as a nurse without any problem, it's <em>heavily</em> implied the only reason Dr. Dibbs is such a nervous wreck is that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoattailRidingRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoattailRidingRelative">husband</a> pushed her to become a doctor and she cracked under the pressure.

</li><li> Eventually, Frasier actually does seek therapy from his Harvard professor/mentor, after the man demonstrated that Frasier couldn't help himself by having him roleplay calling in to his own show <em>as</em> himself. Played for laughs at the end of the episode, when Frasier and said mentor switch places so that Frasier may do the counseling.
</li><li> For bonus points, Frasier's brother is also a psychiatrist, who spends the first few seasons trapped in an abusive and loveless marriage, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove">pining for</a> his father's physical therapist.

She is driven to kill simply to attract their attention.

He has a dentist and an OB/GYN to help him, who could do the surgery for him, but he fervently believes that he should be awake and do it himself. He ends up in so much pain that they knock him out and do it for him.

Troy also calls his parents by their first names, and it turns out that Lieutenant Disher has arrested Troy once before (Troy responds "no" when Randy asks him if he's stayed out of trouble).

Also, he had five children (with a woman he did not marry), all of whom were immediately after birth placed in an orphanage and never heard from again... which somewhat puts his knowledge on child-rearing into doubt, or most likely he saw himself as a bad father and poor civilizing influence on the kids, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">which he more or less admits in his</a> <em>Confessions</em>.
</li><li> Charles Schulz, who went on to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em>, was said to have very bad haircuts as a kid, in spite of the fact that his father was a barber. The reason for this is said to be that he could only get a cut when the barbershop was empty, and when a customer came in he had to get out of the chair and wait before his dad could finish working on him.
</li><li> The wife of 2010 FIFA World Cup Final referee (and police officer by profession) Howard Webb has said (albeit light-heartedly) that in the family home, he's useless at upholding discipline: "He can't take charge of his own children. I don't know how he manages it on a football pitch."
</li><li> In the Australian code of ethics, mental health professionals are obliged to seek treatment for any psychological issues they have themselves, whether the issue is an actual disorder, a drug addiction, or just a very high-stress level. In the healthcare profession as a whole, self-diagnosis is considered bad form (because it's all but impossible to be completely objective about one's own body). There's also the popular perception that dealing with crazy people and their problems on a regular basis can drive someone nuts themselves.
</li><li> Psychologists themselves. There is subversion (and justifications) of a sort in the Indonesian which says, "There are two reasons someone becomes a psychologist. People who have compassion to treat the madmen, and people who are madmen and want to be treated." So basically, people who have psychological issues can become psychologists in the hope of being analyzed and treated. The success, or not, is dependent on each individual.
</li><li> If you live with a handyman of any sort, you know to expect anything that's not working right to stay that way for a long time. The main reason being that they are often busy fixing things for other people that pay them for their services and the house projects keep getting pushed farther back on their "to do" list.

For those too lazy to click a link, it's because you'll be treated the same as you are at work (i.e. horribly) but you won't get paid for it.
</li><li> There are idioms and sayings about this phenomenon in many languages. In Spanish-speaking countries, that would be "En Casa de Herrero, Cuchillo de Palo" (In the blacksmith's house, there are wooden knives), and the Portuguese version "Em casa de ferreiro, espeto é de pau" (Means the same thing). Another would be "Farol de la calle, oscuridad en la casa". (Streetlight outside, darkness inside)
</li><li> There is a logic puzzle (featured in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton">Professor Layton</a> game, among other places) that depends on this: in a town with two barbers, half the townsfolk (including one of the barbers) have impeccable hairstyles, the other half (including the other barber) look like their hair was the lovechild of Chewbacca and Medusa. In some versions (which generally don't mention the haircuts of the general populace), the barber with the good hairstyle keeps a clean shop, while the scruffy barber's shop is very messy. The barber who gives good haircuts is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the unkempt one. Since he can't cut his own hair, obviously he went to his colleague for a haircut, and vice-versa. In versions where the shops differ in cleanliness, it's because the unkempt barber, being better and more popular, doesn't have time to clean up between appointments, while the other barber is less popular and has plenty of time to clean up between haircuts.</span>
</li><li> Statistically, doctors are more likely to drink habitually, be depressed and suicidal than the general populace. All of these eventually lead to medical intervention of one stripe or another (unless the suicidal succeed). And, of course, to <em>become</em> doctors they need to get through medical school and residency, which typically entail chronic sleep deprivation, intermittent hasty meals, and high-stress overwork for years on end.

More broadly, Jordan's home state of North Carolina is infamous for this trope: one of its claims to fame is producing more notable basketball players than almost any other part of the United States, to the point that basketball is considered its unofficial pastime; Jordan himself (raised in Wilmington, originally played for UNC Chapel Hill) is the most famous example, while Stephen Curry (raised in Charlotte, originally played for Davidson College) and Zion Williamson (raised in Salisbury, originally played for Duke University) have come into prominence more recently.

However, as of this writing, no Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup since the 1992-93 season when the Montréal Canadiens won.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7logx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7logx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7logx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not helping is the numerical disadvantage: the NHL has 7 Canadian teams - 6 between 1996 and 2011, where Winnipeg was without a team - and over 20 in the United States</span> That hasn't stopped Canada from dominating in <em>Olympic</em> ice hockey, however. The Canadian National Men's Hockey Team held the record for gold medals for over 50 years before being dethroned by the Soviet Union, and they still regularly make the top three at the Winter Olympics.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s political career is a famous example. As President of the United States, Wilson was almost singlehandedly responsible for the founding of the League of Nations—an international peacekeeping alliance of unprecedented scope and ambition, which rewrote the rules of international diplomacy forever and paved the way for the eventual creation of the United Nations. As a political scientist (the first to lead a Great Power), he had formulated the whole theory of liberal internationalism underwriting the League, and as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> of a diplomat, he banged heads together until his vision was realized. At the time, the creation of the League of Nations was one of the greatest feats of diplomacy in human history, and it required convincing more than 50 different countries to trust each other enough to sit at the negotiating table together after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> had split the world in two. <br/><br/>The one country that Wilson <em>couldn't</em> convince to join the League? His own. Isolationist sentiment in the United States was far-reaching after World War I, and many influential lawmakers in the country were cagey enough about foreign entanglements to stop the United States from becoming a member nation. If there ever was a chance for the United States to join the League, Wilson unintentionally threw it away by not bringing any major players from the Republican Party to the Peace Conference. In particular, Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senate Majority Leader, had expected a seat on the delegation and had few policy quarrels with the Versailles settlement. His disputes with Wilson were largely personal (Given Wilson's holier-than-thou attitude, his failure to bring Lodge is entirely characteristic of him). Thus, Wilson never got to join the organization that he helped build.
<ul><li> One political cartoon is of Wilson himself dragging a small boy in a sailor suit to a fancy gala and scolding him on his poor behavior while the boy tries his damnedest to refuse to comment on America's stance on the League of Nations.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons for the Dissolution of the Soviet Union was that Moscow invested heavily in its military and its subsidies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsawPact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsawPact">Warsaw Pact</a> nations, but this meant that they did not invest nearly enough in internal development in the comparative time frame. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/VictorsPart3_Chom.html">As noted by Noam Chomsky:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>"The Soviet dominion was in fact that unique historical perversity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">an empire in which the center bled itself for the sake of its colonies,</a> or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">for the sake of tranquility in those colonies.</a> Muscovites always lived poorer lives than Varsovians...Throughout the region, journalists and others report, shops are better stocked than in the Soviet Union and material conditions are often better. It is widely agreed that Eastern Europe has a higher standard of living than the USSR."</em>
<ul><li> This is actually far from unique in history. For example in Habsburg Spain, the Castilians were powerless to stop the king from bleeding them dry with taxes compared to the Basques, Catalans, or Portuguese, because the Castilian parliament was depowered in the aftermath of the 1517 Comuneros revolt (unrelatedly, the American colonies also cost Spain more money to maintain than they gave back until the Bourbons reformed the system in the 18th century). In the Ottoman Empire, the Anatolian Turks were stereotyped as country rubes by urban elites that were often Greek, Armenian, or Albanian in origin. And in the modern day United Kingdom, England is the only of four constituent countries without a devolved parliament.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of Silicon Valley residents including tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs enroll their children into Waldorf Schools, despite the main feature being that they're relatively low tech and encourage families to limit their technology use in the home as much as possible. With Jobs being quoted saying that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/fashion/steve-jobs-apple-was-a-low-tech-parent.html">his children haven't used the iPad because of this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Top-tier chefs rarely get to cook for their own families the kinds of fancy meals they make for television shows or restaurants. They either don't have the time or they're just tired of cooking.
</li><li> The European colonial empires were ideally supposed to work by having the home country buy raw materials such as metals, timber, cotton, crude oil, and rubber from the colonies for relatively low prices. They would use their factories to turn this stuff into manufactured goods, then turn around and sell the finished product to the colonials at a considerably marked-up price. This could result in a lower rate of ownership of the very good which their colony was the origin of. The imperial power often perpetuated this situation by stifling the growth of manufacturing in the colonies themselves.
</li><li> The country of Iran is a huge producer of petroleum products, but citizens still pay high prices for gasoline. This has to do with the fact that consumption of gasoline has increased faster than refinery capacity, to the point where they actually have to import some of their gasoline. The effect of economic sanctions on the economy and their limited number of trading partners are also to blame.
</li><li> Venezuela sits on the largest oil reserves in the world, but decades of corruption and lack of maintenance has been ruinous for the infrastructure needed to actually extract and refine the stuff. The Maduro government has presided over a total collapse of the oil industry, which has resulted in people waiting in line for <em>days</em> outside of gas stations, paying exorbitant prices on the black market, or simply being forced to walk.
