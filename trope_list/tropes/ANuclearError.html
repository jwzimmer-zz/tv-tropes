</p><p>During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> (and even since), fiction has made some inaccurate assumptions about nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons policy. It made for more exciting drama when writers could pretend that it was easy for some American or Soviet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> type to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">get control of his country's nukes</a>. However, as the comments below indicate, actual policies changed quite a bit during the Cold War depending on which side one is talking about, so there can be a lot of factual leeway in such situations, especially since many of the facts below have come out only since the 1990s.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p><strong>Types:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Counter-city policies (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe">Fail Safe</a></em>): Only used by the larger powers in the early days of nuclear weapons ('50s-'60s), when there was no hope of guiding them to targets more specific than the general vicinity of the largest cities. Lesser nuclear powers like Britain, France, and the PRC continued these policies to make up for their smaller (less than 300 e.a.) number of weapons. The USSR and USA went on to target specific military and industrial targets ('Counter-Value' policy), but in practice there was little difference between nuking these and nuking cities - especially in places like the West Midlands of England, lower Yangzi, and Japan. While it is sometimes said that the US was less focused on hitting civilian targets than the USSR, this was actually because the Soviets built their military and industrial facilities as far from their civilian population centers as possible to minimize civilian casualties from 'Counter-Value' nuclear strikes <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fn3t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fn3t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fn3t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Of course, this resulted in an awful lot of industries being concentrated in less-than-ideal-for-profitability-purposes areas </span>. While the USA could have reciprocated, they considered the cost and morale-damaging effects prohibitive.
</li><li> A Soviet first strike (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Threads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Threads">Threads</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfter">The Day After</a></em>): the Soviet Union had a "No First Use" policy (= only use nuclear weapons if first attacked with nuclear weapons) in the 1980s. Before then, there were plans for first use, but only in response to an imminent Western attack. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames">WarGames</a></em> is correct in its usage, as there never was an actual first launch (it was all the military's computer playing a game of <em>Global Thermonuclear War,</em> with the first strike being made by a teenage hacker, unaware he's actually making the US think they're under attack).
<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> During the Cold War and post-Cold War analysis of East German, Czech and Polish documents, many people confused the term "pre-emption" with "first strike". Pre-emption is like this: it is considered self-defense to draw and shoot if the other guy starts to draw his gun first.
</li><li> Even the films referenced above don't play it exceptionally straight: while Threads makes mention of the fact that during the time the big nukes were flying, Western response times were slower than others, blame wasn't specifically placed on the USSR for shooting first. In The Day After, it's never made explicit who shot first strategically. (Though in both films, the events that lead to war are precipitated by Soviet armed forces expanding into regions like the Middle East, so...) This is partly excusable because there is/was a general public fear that any side could strike first contrary to stated policy (lookup Able Archer '83 for one nearly catastrophic example), and that one nuke's launch is enough to get the powder keg going.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> While the Soviets had such a policy, there was certainly a fair amount of fear among NATO that the no-first-use policy was just PR, and that it could have been undone at the stroke of a pen by the Premier, so movies hypothesizing about a Soviet first strike aren't wholly irrational. In an actual fact the policy was genuine, and the Soviet leader <em>could not</em> change it on a whim (it was a Politburo-level collegial decision<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1utwh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1utwh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1utwh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, it was true even for a much less serious affairs, e.g. in both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan">Afghanistan invasion</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">the respective</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonidBrezhnev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonidBrezhnev">Soviet leaders</a> were basically bluffed into greenlighting them by the hawkish security chiefs and overconfident allies.</span>), but there were a lot of strange ideas about how Soviet Union ticked in the West at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> The rogue launch:
<ul><li> In general, Soviet Cold War weapons had coded locks (Permissive Action Link), requiring authorisation from the top commanders to be armed. During the Cuban missile crisis however, there were missile carriers capable of independent launch of armed missiles.
</li><li> On the US side, until the 1990s, it would have required at least three people to launch an armed attack from a submarine (and a missile launch from a submarine would be damned near impossible without the full support of the crew). Other launch methods had the coded locks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wukf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wukf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wukf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though until 1977, one could still make an unarmed launch with the code <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish">00000000</a> and it was listed on all launch checklists</span>. This system, however, only really existed after 1962.
</li><li> In the UK, on the other hand, until 1998 the RAF's nuclear missiles were secured with nothing more than a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/11_november/15/newsnight.shtml">cylindrical bicycle lock key<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3cwi5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3cwi5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3cwi5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Military humour being what it is, it was a running gag that this made the UK the safest place in the world to store nukes because the key would have been lost almost immediately and you'd need fifteen forms and three Warrant Officers' permission, plus a three week wait to requisition a pair of bolt-cutters. This is not <em>entirely</em> untrue as anyone with experience of the UK forces can attest</span>. Royal Navy Trident submarines are still able to launch without a code since a mere ten minute warning meant that if a nuclear war had broken out, it is unlikely that there would be time to issue relevant orders to their submarine captains. Plus, no officer of the Royal Navy would ever consider acting without orders or the proper cirumstances. It just wouldn't be cricket. And all sailors work for the Queen, who would be utterly Not Amused.
<ul><li> The sub commanders <em>do</em> have their orders: the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_of_last_resort">letters of last resort<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> written by the Prime Minister, containing orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the British government.
</li></ul></li><li> France faced the same issues, yet they figured they weren't worth the potential risks of starting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>. They installed the same kind of locks the US and USSR used. They are also less fond of cricket.
</li><li> Recently declassified data has revealed that the US protections vs. "rogue launch" pretty much only existed from 1961 onwards. In the 50s, there were no physical safety interlocks on US nuclear warheads, at least a half-dozen senior officers had the authority to launch a nuclear strike on their own initiative (said authority intended to be used only if a war situation occurred and the President was out of communication, but as with the Trident submarine example above the only real enforcement was the honor system), and in some cases, bomber units were under orders to attack Russia immediately if they ever <em>stopped</em> receiving periodic "don't attack" messages from HQ — i.e., the same situation as the fictional 'Fail-Safe' example.
</li><li> The US also had nuclear weapons stationed on foreign soil in countries like Italy and Turkey which had experienced military coups. Even with a two key lock system, there was nothing to stop the keys from being seized by force.
</li></ul></li><li> The nuclear button (<em>Eagle Strike</em>): Neither side in the Cold War had nor has a nuclear launch button, even in their "nuclear footballs". The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_briefcase">nuclear footballs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> contain information about nuclear strategy, and equipment for the leader to communicate with, and authenticate himself to, the military personnel in individual silos (etc) who would actually carry out a launch.
<ul><li> The Soviet/Russian nuclear briefcase, codenamed "Cheget", after a mountain the the Caucasus, is actually a communication terminal that's <em>always</em> online, and has been ever since the system was activated in 1983. If it ever loses connection with the "Kazbek"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note454jr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note454jr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note454jr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Another mountain</span> control system of the Strategic Nuclear Forces, it's regarded as a "Launch" command, because it's taken as a sign that its bearer is incapacitated. There are three such briefcases, one for the President <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ofv4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5ofv4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ofv4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">CPSU General Secretary in Soviet times, actual Soviet President was a technical position that didn't carry much political power until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonidBrezhnev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonidBrezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a></span>, one for the Defence Minister and one for the Chief of General Staff. An actual nuclear strike requires receiving the command from at least two out of three devices.
</li><li> A related error is the idea of "nuclear launch codes" that the President, or a similar official, has <em>memorised</em>. This is often used to establish a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> scenario where the President must be rescued before some villain can extract the codes from him, or simply be why the President must not be allowed to be captured in the first place. In real life, the launch codes are written down (since you don't really want your country blown up without retaliation because someone can't remember a code) and usually kept in the nuclear briefcase, issue orders rather than allowing the direct remote launching of weapons, and would be changed if the President was compromised in some way anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Presidential power: The US President cannot launch a nuclear first strike without the cooperation of the Secretary of Defense or any other administrative official that's been appointed/approved by Congress (e.g., CIA director, most of the Presidential Cabinet...). Ordering a retaliatory strike was something a number of people had authority to do. The plane known as "Looking Glass" had authority to do so in the event that the National Command Authority was killed or out of contact. Were DEFCON to reach level 2, both pilot and co-pilot would be required to wear eye-patches in case a nuclear explosion render their exposed eye either momentarily or permanently blind. Nowadays they use goggles that instantaneously turn opaque when exposed to the bright flash of a nuclear detonation and then return to clear to allow the pilots to see clearly. While current policies are classified, it can be assumed that after a major strike on the USA, remaining weapons would be released, with or without higher command. For the Soviets, supposedly, the semi-automatic <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetr">Perimetr<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> system had three human operators who were able to give the order to launch all remaining warheads in case when on-site seismic detectors detected multiple nuclear explosions on Soviet soil and high command is inaccessible.
<ul><li> The <em>Perimetr</em> is only a part of the larger all-encompassing <em>Kazbek</em> control system that also includes aforementioned nuclear briefcases, and it serves as its "fail-deadly" fallback that ensures that the retaliatory strike will be launched even if <em>everyone</em> in the chain of command is incapacitated. It is, however, in a standby mode normally, and is supposed to be activated only when there is imminent threat of an attack.
</li></ul></li><li> Using a missile warhead as a stand-still bomb: Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, virtually all nuclear warheads are designed so that they will only go off after being exposed to certain environmental conditions- as in the large numbers of Gs associated with a missile launch.
<ul><li> This can be overstated, however; accelerometers and other arcane safeguards are intended to protect vs. accidents. If you deliberately intend to misuse a warhead in such a manner you would presumably have the knowledge and opportunity to simply remove the detonator mechanism and install a new one, or tamper with the existing one.
</li><li> The US nuclear weapons laboratories apparently think that their nukes could not be made to detonate without the codes, even if the labs themselves tried. To date, this has not been tested.
</li></ul></li><li> Most films behave as if only the USA and USSR had nukes. In reality the UK and France were also nuclear powers before the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Later Communist China, India, Pakistan, and South Africa (probably joint-developed with Israel) produced weapons before the end of the Cold War. The Republic of China/Taiwan also made a bid for acquiring nukes in the 1970s-80s, but was blackmailed out of it by the USA. In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a>, Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons since the 60s or 70s<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69dy1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note69dy1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69dy1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Something they <em>still</em> deny to this day, despite overwhelming evidence of the Israeli nuclear weapons program. Generally, everyone says they don't have them, while everyone knows they do. Israel's enemies publicly decry the fact that Israel is the only nuclear-equipped Middle East state, while the rest of the world brushes off such accusations. It's...complicated</span>. Several European countries had American bombs stationed there too. South Africa disarmed in 1990, while it is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> that Pakistan is still making them. Iran and Syria are suspected by some of having nuclear weapons programmes also. Many European countries still have American nuclear gravity bombs stationed there - the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey among others. Their pilots train to use them; in the event of war, the US bombs would be turned over to local NATO forces.
<ul><li> Although the Vela Incident was likely a simple equipment error on what was then an aging satellite, one the popular theories circulating about it is that it detected a real detonation - perhaps even a joint Israeli/South African nuclear test, as S. Africa was being subjected to multiple embargoes and sanctions due to Apartheid, and Israel was looking for a nation to help them gain nuclear capability because they were being embargoed by some countries in NATO.
</li><li> Note that while North Korea's interest in developing nuclear weapons goes back to the 1950s, the country did not test its first nuclear weapon until 2006. As such, North Korea did not have nukes during the Cold War period.
<ul><li> And even so, it's by-and-large suspected that every North Korean nuclear weapon tested to date has been a fizzle (nuclear weapons parlance for a <strong>dud</strong>)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note753ho');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note753ho" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note753ho');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It should be noted that a fizzle just means that the nuke didn't reach the expected yield, <em>not</em> that it didn't detonate at all. A fizzle can still yield a blast measured in kilotons, with the largest fizzle, a failure of a fusion secondary during a 1 megaton nuke test, reaching an estimated 250 kilotons. Considering that it still means partial fusion was reached, the test was considered a partial success.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Disarming a ICBM Post-Launch: Deployed strategic ballistic missiles do not have any mechanisms for the attacker to remotely disarm or destroy the weapons after launch, and use inertial guidance based their maneuvers from a known initial launching position and so cannot be steered off-course either. For all intents and purposes once the missile has been fired it can only be stopped either by mechanical malfunction or interception. Missiles which are used for testing are modified with a self-destruct mechanism in case something goes wrong, but live warheads are not used for testing the missiles.
<ul><li> The MX (Peackeeper) missile was supposed to have post-launch re-targeting ability: its warhead bus (post-boost stage, responsible for individual targeting of warheads) was supposed to be reprogrammable in flight. On practice it means, that it could receive coded command to change one target list for another, as long as warheads were still attached to it. In theory, it was supposed to gave US officials additional time to think; they could launch missiles on warning (thus avoiding the danger of them being caught on ground), observe the enemy attack hits, and then issue the orders to already-launched missiles - exactly which enemy targets to attack. However, it seems that this system was never actually deployed.
</li><li> Gravity bombs on the other hand did have this sort of thing, each was equipped with a scuttle charge in case the bomber had to drop its bombs to make it home. On some models the timer on the scuttle charge was designed to activate even in an aggressive drop, though considerably after the bomb would have detonated if it wasn't a dud (and the chances of a nuke remaining intact after trying to detonate are slim anyway).

When the Americans realize that he is being taken back to Russia by submarine, they figure that it would be better to kill their greatest inventor than to let his creations fall into enemy hands. They send out a sea-based nuclear warhead to destroy the boat, thinking that it will be a small enough accident that it can be blamed on an accident aboard.

Because they are literally following their instructions, which tell them to ignore stand-down orders, the U.S. has to give the Soviets whatever information they can to tell them <em>how to shoot down their own planes</em> but one bomber escapes the defences and heads for Moscow. When the inevitable becomes clear, the President offers a solution to his Soviet counterpart to avoid a nuclear holocaust.

The by-now equally keyed-up Soviet submariners respond with an atomic torpedo before they're destroyed. Downplayed in that tactical nuclear weapons, like atomic torpedoes, tend to lack the technological protections and locks that are used on strategic nuclear weapons, like nuclear missiles.

The United States would <strong>never</strong> test launch missiles with nuclear warheads (armed or not), for exactly the reason shown in the film: any accident could cause vast destruction. Dummy warheads are always used<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8d2si');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8d2si" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8d2si');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were two exceptions to this. The first was the <em>Frigate Bird</em> test, which was a live-fire test of a Polaris missile with a 1.5 MT warhead. The test was performed mainly for political reasons, as one of the last open sky tests before the Partial Test Ban took effect; also, it was launched from a submerged submarine well out to sea, and the missile was not only provided with just enough fuel to reach its target, the warhead was modified so that it wouldn't detonate <strong>below</strong> a minimum height of 30km. The other exceptions were the various high-altitude/near-Earth space effects tests such as the infamous <em>Starfish Prime</em>, which were performed with modified sounding rockets rather than weapon-type missiles - they couldn't reach anywhere except 400km straight up.</span>. Even worse, a newspaper headline before the test mentions that live warheads would be used. So the U.S. military said publicly that they were going to pull this harebrained stunt and <em>no one objected</em>. This of course creates an opportunity by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> to murder millions in a way that takes the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> to stop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastWar">The Last War</a></em> averts several tropes by making the sides the Federation and Alliance, and not pointing fingers at any countries in the nuclear attack at the end.
</li><li> The villain's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleGhostProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleGhostProtocol">Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol</a></em> made and set in 2011, involves seizing control of a single nuclear missile and making it look like a Russian first strike on the U.S. (specifically San Francisco) in order to start a nuclear world war. This <em>might</em> have worked some 30 years earlier in 1981. But in 2011, a single nuclear detonation (on a civilian population center rather than a military target) would likely be assumed an act of terrorism. Even if it appeared to be a genuine Russian attack, a <em>single</em> missile (tracked as it came in) would not provoke immediate all out retaliation because it would be obvious there were no other inbound missiles. The inaccuracy and gross misunderstanding of nuclear politics is made even worse considering the villain is supposed to be an expert on the subject in-universe, albeit one who is insane.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiesLikeUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiesLikeUs">Spies Like Us</a></em>.

However, one of them remembers that the missile has "source-programmable guidance", so they transmit a signal to it that causes it to fly out into space and explode. Not only do nuclear missiles not have such an option, it would be impossible for the missile to change course that way.

A Politburo discussion about options for preventing the defection of Ramius, specifically pointed out that without the appropriate signal from an accelerometer, the weapon couldn't detonate.

Also, the missile the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> is attempting to blow in place had been specifically rigged beforehand with a non-standard detonator package, precisely to enable this contingency plan.

</li><li> At the end, Imran Zakhaev takes over a Loyalist nuclear launch facility and launches nukes at the United States in retaliation for the continued US and British presence in Russia, but again the game doesn't really explain how they were able to crack the coded locks, as the US forces had to badger the Russian Loyalists just to get the auto-destruct codes.

Fortunately he set the missiles to blow up <em>above</em> Washington DC as an EMP to cripple Russian air superiority, as they were bringing all their materiel and troops in by plane.
</li><li> Modern Warfare 3 revolves around rogue Ultranationalist terrorist Vladimir Makarov kidnapping the Russian president and forcing him to give up the Russian nuclear codes so he can destroy Europe, even though the actual Russian Army who he's secretly in league with (maybe—it's not explained much and contradicts what <em>was</em> established in the last game) are trying to conquer it.

<ul><li> So far as anyone knows, there has never been an accidental nuclear detonation. But there have been serious errors, usually resulting from midair collisions, where nuclear weapons have been lost temporarily. Others have occurred where the non-nuclear components of the bomb detonated due to accidents, but as they must detonate in a precise sequence with extremely tight time tolerances, the only result was spreading radioactive material around.
<ul><li> The closest Spain ever got was probably when a US bomber was destroyed in a refueling accident, releasing all four bombs in its payload (with the non-nuclear explosives aboard two detonating, spreading contamination to a significant area. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Palomares_B-52_crash">More details here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> In 1961, the US almost nuked North Carolina (a state on the USA's eastern coast) with a 3-4 megaton bomb when a mid-air refueling accident damaged a B-52 nuclear bomber aeroplane and forced its crew to bail out, leaving the bombs onboard. The aircraft broke up in mid-air, causing one of the two bombs it had carried to deploy its parachute and arm itself as per a usual bomb-drop (unlike normal bombs, nuclear bombs were fitted with parachutes to give the bomber time to escape the blast). Thankfully, the bomb couldn't have detonated without a crew activated safety switch, so there was no danger of full detonation. The design of the bomber aircraft and bombs, and the routine nature of such flights and refuelings (a fleet of these bombers was in the air at all times, ready to nuke the USSR at a moment's notice if necessary), meant that a repeat of the incident was almost inevitable until the parachute system was replaced. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash">More details here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> There was also a case of the USA losing a nuclear bomb, never to be found again. What happened was that an F-86 fighter plane collided with a B-47 bomber carrying the device. To prevent an explosion and loss of the crew, the bomb was dropped. Several unsuccessful searches later, the bomb was presumed lost somewhere in Wassaw Sound off the shores of Tybee Island. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Tybee_Island_mid-air_collision">Read the story here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Britain's contribution to nearly starting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW3">WW 3</a> involved a front-line Vulcan nuclear bomber on patrol in West Germany (awaiting orders to turn right and head for Leningrad) - and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements">chocolate biscuit</a>. What happened is that the particular sort of chocolate biscuit issued to RAF aircrew (as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">Spot of Tea</a> even nuclear bomber crews get) was prone to exploding in a semi-pressurised cabin at high altitude. Bored crews used to lay one out in a prominent position, on top of the Flight Engineer's console, and lay bets on how long it took to detonate. On this occassion, a Tunnock's Teacake dunked in tea exploded in such a way that fragments of tea-soaked biscuit found their way inside the flight engineer's console. In which 1960's computer circuitry was used to arm and activate the nuke prior to a stand-off launch. A short-circuit was caused and the console lit up indicating the weapon was armed and ready for launch. The crew managed to land in time and the bomb was deactivated. But after that the RAF issued a different sort of biscuit to flight crews. (Come on, you cannot cancel the tea-break for British service personnel...)
</li><li> And worse? The world may have been closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> than even during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CubanMissileCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CubanMissileCrisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>.
<ul><li> In 1983, war tensions were high between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. For a few years, the USSR under Brezhnev and Andropov were terrified that a United States first strike was imminent, and had instituted the RYaN (from the Russian meaning something like "Nuclear Rocket Attack") program to find any hints of warlike intentions. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11xuy8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11xuy8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11xuy8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(To make things even worse on this score, the agents tasked with finding this information were berated if they didn't gather positive signs of preparation for a US first strike — anything that suggested the US was NOT about to nuke Moscow was derided as "misinformation" —, and so liberally interpreted every scrap of info in the worst possible sense. In short, the Soviets were talking themselves, quite by accident, into the very nuclear war they feared was coming from the other side.)</span> In the summer of '83, the Able Archer '83 exercises (a NATO communications exercise meant to simulate the first week of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarThree">World War III</a>, culminating on the last day with a rehearsal of an expected nuclear exchange) were held, this coinciding with the controversial arrival of Pershing nuclear missiles <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12awn4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12awn4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12awn4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which were capable of hitting Russia within five to six minutes, well under any sort of Soviet early-warning capability</span>. The Soviets were monitoring in real time and were becoming increasingly alarmed at the exercise. The coinciding of the two events sent Soviet suspicions through the roof. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">And, the Soviet early-warning satellite system was fundamentally flawed.</a> The system registered five ICBMs from three separate launches headed towards Russia.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13curc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13curc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13curc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In reality, what had happened was that sunlight reflecting off the Earth hit in just the right manner to appear to the satellite's IR sensors to be missile launches.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Colonel Stanislav Petrov</a>, the officer in charge of the station, realized quickly that the United States would not launch a first strike with just five missiles — had they actually intended to initiate war they'd have launched <em>everything</em>, in an attempt to cut the head off their enemy before it could retaliate significantly. Suspecting an equipment error, especially since he could not corroborate the apparent launches with radar data (which said there were no missiles at all), he shut down the first two alarms, and explained to his superiors that he was ignoring the third, citing the fact that only five missiles had been launched. It is somewhat exaggerated how much of a threat this was given the non-correlation of the radar and satellite data, and this example is often treated as if Petrov had authority to launch missiles <em>himself</em>, but it is <em>possible</em> that if he had treated the alarm as genuine the Soviet Union would have responded with a "counter" launch, leading to a real counterlaunch from the US and MAD. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">And, to top it all off, Petrov wasn't supposed to be the man on duty that day. He had taken the shift for another operator who was sick.</a> The Soviet Union being what it was, Petrov was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">promptly relieved of duty</a> pending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee">an official inquiry</a>, primarily because admitting the satellite system was flawed would be a huge embarrassment for the Soviet Union. (For what it's worth, they decided he'd acted properly and he was reinstated.)
</li><li> Even after the Petrov incident, there were still tensions. Two weeks before the Able Archer exercise began, a Marine base in Beirut was hit by a suicide bomber, killing over 200 US Marines. All US bases around the world were put on alert after that, stoking Soviet paranoia. This was followed by considerable encrypted communications traffic between the White House and Downing Street concerning British objections to the U.S. invasion of Grenada (a Commonwealth Realm). Unable to decrypt that traffic, the Soviets assumed it concerned plans for a NATO attack. Then, Able Archer '83 entered its crescendo phase — the simulation of Soviet chemical attacks on Western Europe, and NATO commanders making the decision to launch retaliatory strikes on Eastern Europe. These messages were picked up by Soviet wiretaps, and sent Andropov and the Kremlin into a frothing panic. Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops were sent to their wartime mobilization positions, and nuclear bombers were put in the air as a precaution. It was only tamped down once a East German agent named TOPAZ<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14e33v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14e33v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14e33v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Real name <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Rupp">Rainer Rupp<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a West German of strong leftist political convictions who became a spy for East German intelligence</span>, who had access to Cosmic Top Secret documents at NATO sent off an urgent message to the East German HVA, who passed it to the KGB, stating baldly that NATO had no concrete intentions of attacking, and that the exercise was as it appeared — just an exercise.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007">Korean Air Lines Flight 007<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a civilian 747, strayed off course and flew into Soviet airspace, where it was mistaken for a spy plane. It was then shot down with all onboard lost. Reagan coined the phrase "evil empire" referring to the Soviet Union after this incident, and banned Aeroflot (the Soviet national airline) from landing in the States. Long story short, 1983 was a bad year in international relations.
<ul><li> A good deal of that "bad year" thing is because (according to his memoirs) Reagan <em>didn't know</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">the Soviets genuinely feared an American first strike</a>. It was not until the reports of the Soviet reaction to Able Archer 83 made their way back to him six months later that he began to properly understand how they regarded the US and how close it had been.
</li></ul></li><li> Even the end of the Cold War didn't stop these close calls - a rocket carrying scientific equipment for studying the aurora borealis was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_rocket_incident">launched from Norway in January 1995<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but its trajectory took it over Moscow and its flight path was the same as a Minuteman ICBM launched from North Dakota. The scientists had notified Russia (and about thirty others) about the launch, but no one told the personnel at the radar installation that detected it. End result: full alert was issued all the way up to President Boris Yeltsin, and the nuclear briefcase used to authorize nuclear attack was activated (the only time in history thus far this has happened).
</li></ul></li><li> Sometime around the crisis with the Israeli attack on the <em>USS Liberty</em>, the US 6th Fleet <strong>accidentally</strong> issued a valid nuclear release code to some of its ships as part of a readiness exercise. This was not an order for a strike, it simply gave authority to use nuclear weapons to the ship captains. Because it was a scheduled exercise and the message format indicated it was an exercise message, all of the captains or ships involved elected to ignore the validity of the code itself.
</li><li> The paranoia came back with a vengeance on January 13th, 2018, when a U.S. nuclear alarm system test was accidentally replaced with a full alert. A few minutes after eight in the morning, the entire state of Hawaii received a smartphone notification (along with interrupted TV and radio) that told them to seek shelter for a nuclear attack, which thanks to the suddenness of the alert, the belligerence of the president at the time, and the stirrings of relatively nearby North Korea led to a panic. Though the alarm system wasn't tied to actual nuclear alarm procedures, meaning any government official or those who'd noticed the lack of sirens or other alerts didn't buy it, the event still resulted in at least one death, a heart attack, and a host of anecdotes about someone here or there doing things they only would've done thinking they were about to die for at least 15 minutes.</li></ul></div>
