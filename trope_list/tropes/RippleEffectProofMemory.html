</p><p>The trope becomes trickier when characters who <em>don't</em> have the above justification get Ripple Effect Proof Memory anyway. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed">Psychic Nosebleed</a> might ensue when someone whose memory isn't <em>completely</em> "proof" gets an "update" on a new lifetime and the mental stress from trying to contain memories from a large number of timelines actually harms the physical body. This might happen even if memories are the only thing that carry over from shift to shift and <em>the time traveler is no longer in his or her original body</em>. The technical term for this is "the time travel clone memory feedback problem." We're working hard to find a cure.

<ul><li> Played more plausible than most examples since he usually gains no more than a weeks worth of memory at a time and it still disorients him immensely to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> (from the point of view of other characters who don't have this ability).
</li><li> Also, not only is Okabe the only person with this effect, but he has no idea how he got it or <em>why</em>, though it's implied it was due to a childhood illness. Many of his problems from the first half of the series are caused by not being able/willing to see the world changed, which coupled with the social skills of a turnip results in him scaring or temporarily vilifying most of the main cast. Then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Knight of Cerebus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">shows up ...</a>
<ul><li> The series later explains that the ability for people to retain memories of alternate timelines is not something exclusive to Okabe.

<ul><li> In the Zagreus arc we meet the Neverpeople. These are Gallifreyan criminals sentenced to removal from history. They retain their memories of the timeline that had been theirs, while the rest of the universe  including the people responsible for their removal  have no recollection of them. One strange side effect is that the Time Lords believe that this particular method of execution has not been used in eons, since, in the resulting timeline, its victims never existed in the first place. The problem is that there <em>are</em> records resistant to the changes imposed by the chamber, and when the person who has routinely authorized its use hundreds if not thousands of times has a good look at them, she's so overcome by horror and guilt she enters the chamber willingly.

The old Doctor stops in the middle of the fight to point out that he can freely travel through time, threatening them with "imagine fighting someone who could shoot you as you emerged from your mother's womb or hold a pillow over your face in a retirement home." He then adds "worse still, imagine the local doctor, back when you were in high school, giving you a funny feeling you'd carry around for the rest of your natural life". He doesn't go as far as raping The Engineer (or if he does it's off-page, or has been changed in the reprinting) but the comic does take a panel to show him kissing her on the back of the neck. He asks her "Hello again, Miss Angela Spica of class 4B. Remember me?" which starts her crying and whispering "oh my god..."
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, after all the various Earths merge into one coherent history, all the superheroes who survived the transformation wake up the next day with their memories intact, though these fade in a few months, replaced with ones where they lived in the shared universe all their lives and had memories of fighting in a battle against the Anti-Monitor in 1985. The only person who actually remembers the Crisis and the infinite universes that preceded it is the Psycho-Pirate, who at the end of the series is shown to reside in an psychiatric hospital, rambling about the events of the Crisis, while everyone thinks he's mad. Later on, Psycho-Pirate's ripple-proof memory becomes a major plot point in Grant Morrison's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a></em>, when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-warping</a> powers and tries to bring back all the characters lost in the Crisis, as he's the only one who still remembers them.</span>

</li><li> Likewise, explained within the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> series, as anyone jumping into the 'empyrean fire' of the time stream seems to be immune to the effects of any temporal changes. That such a thing also happens to impart the user with superpowers and would be the only way to make the local pastiche of Superman/Captain Marvel/generic hero work without a paradox is just an extra bonus. Oddly, some people in the series have at least some resistance to the Ripple Effect. In one story, the viewpoint character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Michael Tenicek has his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">erased from reality</a> by an unsuccessful attempt by a villain to muck with the timestream, presented in the style of a Crisis-like event</span>, but the old timeline haunts his dreams. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A godlike character tells him what happened, and offers him the option to forget her, but he declines ... and is told that no one ever accepts.</span>

</li><li> Wolverine actually ended up remembering <em>more</em> of the original timeline than he ever had before, as an unintended side-effect of Scarlet Witch's spell.

He first demonstrated this when he retains his knowledge of Wally West's secret identity after the Spectre wipes it from the world's minds, and second when he resurfaces in the <em>Rebirth</em> era, remembering his encounters with Wally prior to the New 52. Writer Joshua Williamson has even explicitly said that he is the pre-Flashpoint Hunter Zolomon.

They go back in time to presumably create a stable loop but things end up changed anyway and the older version of Jay gets the new memories his younger version is getting while also retaining his memory of the way things originally went.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> where Barry Allen wakes up one day to find the world is completely different, and the least of the changes is that he never gained superpowers. He's the only one who remembers the previous timeline, but this memory is slowly being erased and replaced with memories of the new one. Thus it takes Barry almost the entire series to realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's the one who changed the past in the first place, by going back and preventing his mother's murder.</span> Also completely averted with the ending, in which the timeline is changed again (to one very similar to the "correct" timeline, but with some differences.) This time, no one remembers the old timeline, including Barry.
</li><li> And now in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em> is the pre-Flashpoint Wally West who has been stuck in the Speed Force since the New 52 began. He remembers the past relationships, at least until he's pulled out and the old memories begin to fade or get jumbled with the New 52 timeline. While he mostly remembers the pre-Flashpoint timeline, he's also starting to remember his newer, New 52 timeline.
</li><li> Eobard Thawne returns during the <em>Rebirth</em> run of <em>The Flash</em>, possessing his New 52 counterpart and overriding the latter's powers and costume. He <em>only</em> remembers the timeline right until the New 52 began (he died right before it), and this becomes a plot point later when he finds that his knowledge of the Flashes and their history is in need of updating.
</li><li> Jay Garrick in <em>Rebirth</em> is found stuck in the Speed Force, and seems to remember his history with Wally West and Barry Allen, which didn't exist in the New 52. Like Wally, his being stuck in the Speed Force seemed to allow him to view both histories, but unlike Wally, Jay doesn't <em>exist</em> in the New 52 timeline.
</li><li> In <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> #1, the original Wally West appears to Johnny Thunder. His narration makes it clear that Johnny remembers the pre-Flashpoint timeline as well, including the history of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JSA">JSA</a>, who don't exist in the New 52. As a result of his ramblings (and the unfortunate fact that he <em>really</em> does have Alzheimer's), he's been diagnosed as insane. However, when he escapes the hospital, he shows he remembers the Society and Green Lantern's battery.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong">Tom Strong</a> featured an aversion of this trope. His greatest adversary managed, at one point, to take over the time stream, and used some new technology to open a time gate, pulling versions of himself from all points in his life through the gate and into the timeline. He ended up with the backflow of over three hundred separate memory streams converging on his head all at once- luckily, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches">Clock Roach</a> guardian he defeated to take over the time stream felt generous enough to send them all back, with the note that the youngest of them will have to go through every single one of the summonings and unsummonings.

If memory and ontology were both immune to the ripple effect, then what would be left to change as a result of time travel?
</li><li> The lack of an alternate version of Marty is averted in the second movie, however. It is implied that there is an alternate version of Marty in the new timeline, but Marty never meets him because Biff sent him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffToBoardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffToBoardingSchool">Off to Boarding School</a>.

Marty gets help from 1955 Doc to go back to 1885 and save the 1985 Doc. When he gets there, 1985 Doc asks him not only how he got there, but also who dressed him in such ridiculous clothes. Marty says that 1955 Doc did. At which point Doc remembers. That could just as easily be explained as Doc not really remembering (to him) a 30-year-old minor event until Marty reminded him.

When Samantha wakes up, she doesn't know who Ringwald and Nelson are or why they are in her bedroom. Ringwald and Nelson leave, commenting that Ringwald's plan worked, indicating that they do remember: possibly because they are external to the school.

The Time Matrix also seems to confer this ability on to everyone who uses it (at least for changes they make using the Time Matrix), including Visser Four himself.

That makes sense, as his dream causes it. It is also discovered that anyone in the room with him when he is hypnotized into dreaming a change also knows it. That makes slightly less sense, although since his subconscious is involved and the method used is not machine based, it certainly is possible. Even though other people with him can know, they are still not sure it happens unless he reminds them or it is a major change <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(like 90% of the population dies)</span>.
</li><li> The eponymous Nobody in <em>Nobody Gets the Girl</em> is a product of this for most people when they experience this fade away. But the limitations are he can't be seen by anybody who doesn't believe he is there, and he can't move objects when he is being observed by someone who can't see him. But he can be observed by video cameras.

Although the agents themselves will have no knowledge of the previous history, they can research their own files to determine if changes have been made. In the novel <em>Watching the Clock</em>, there's also a subplot that takes two of the protagonists to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime">Place Beyond Time</a>, leaving their memories of another character intact when she suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a>.

This is implied to be one of its original purposes, besides just being preternaturally sharp and conferring the skills of past wielders on the current wielder. Ultimately, the Boxes of Orden are the only way to repair the damage, and that was their original purpose. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And the Sword of Truth is the key to the Boxes of Orden, making <em>the</em> counter to the Chainfire spell.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>'s novel "Q-Squared", an insane Trelane (actually a fledgling Q who merged with a Primordial Chaos), decides to destroy existence by merging several TNG timelines into one. Trek Prime is of course the 'prime', but there's also a track where Jack Crusher never died (Picard is his Number One) but Wesley died as a child (resulting in a Picard/Beverly affair), and another track from the "Yesterday's Enterprise" universe, except in this track the <em>Enterprise</em>-D reaches the <em>Enterprise</em>-C too late, and the C crew is already dead. They scuttle the ship so the Klingons don't get it and keep going. The downside is that when the Federation-Klingon War Picard encounters Lt. Worf (and later, an alt-universe special forces Klingon Empire Worf) during a time track overlap, it ends badly.
</li><li> A particularly convoluted example from a recent novel involved Scotty going back in time to save Kirk from "death" on the <em>Enterprise-B</em>. Since Kirk wasn't in the Nexus to be pulled out by Picard, the <em>Enterprise-D</em> was destroyed, and the Borg succeeded in changing history in <em>First Contact</em>. In the new timeline, only Scotty (and an accomplice?) recall the original timeline — and they're the only non-assimilated humans. Presumably the Borg know, but they aren't talking.

If you make the changes yourself you will usually still remember the original timeline, but not always, and even if you do that can cause its own problems—as shown in <em>Legends</em> when Constantine suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySkullRunnethOver">My Skull Runneth Over</a> due to his and Charlie's repeated attempts to create a "perfect" timeline.

Stein is soon hit with flashes of a strange woman he worries might be a new love. When he comes home in 2016, he finds the woman is Lilly, his daughter. As far as everyone else (including Barry Allen) is concerned, Lilly has always existed but Stein has no memory of her at all.
</li><li> During a crossover, Caitlin Snow sees Stein and Lilly talking, notices how Stein isn't picking up on Lilly's references to the past and realizes something is wrong. Stein reveals the truth and how he intends to "correct" this by finding a way to erase Lilly as she should be. He defends himself on how the woman is a stranger but a horrified Caitlin points out that as far as Lilly herself is concerned, she's a woman not understanding why her loving father that she's always had a close relationship to is freezing her out.
</li><li> Once Stein resolves not to erase her, however, he suddenly starts getting the memories of raising her even though he technically wasn't there, suggesting that after her presence in the timeline "solidified" by him not changing it, his memories caught up.

Ray reappears as soon as the ship travels to the day before young Ray's death, as the events haven't yet solidified to make themselves permanent. Ray's own memories remain unaffected, despite his younger self experiencing multiple changes, including meeting his future self (although Adult!Ray never actually tells him who he is, but the Atom suit might have served as Young!Ray's inspiration to create it in the future).

</li><li> While the Time Bureau is supposed to exist outside of time to solve anachronisms, it appears they can be prone to being hit by changes in history. In one episode, the Legends discover that, thanks to being inspired by a talking doll named Beebo, the Vikings conquered all of North America. Talking to Ava on what's meant to be Christmas, Sara is struck when Ava refers to a "Beebo's Day miracle." Seeing her reaction makes Ava realize that's the anachronism ("never felt right").

The effects of proximity to a time crack are all-but-confirmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong">"The Wedding of River Song"</a>, where Amy is again able to retain memories of timelines that never were.
</li><li> One of the DVD-only extra scenes from the Moffat era confirmed what many fans had previously thought was implied by on-screen material: Amy Pond, whose timeline has undergone a particularly large number of retrospective rewrites both deliberate and accidental, can remember <strong>all</strong> of her alternate pasts.
</li><li> Going along with having one's personal history changed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a> features three Doctors meeting and pulling off a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">Tricked Out Time</a> to prevent what they see as their greatest failure. Their meeting and actions cause the timelines to go out of sync, causing only the "oldest" of the three Doctors to remember events. Assuming "The Curator" is indeed a far-future regeneration, then Eleven, the oldest of the three, loses memories as well.

After the situation is resolved, he's asked what effect their choices will have, and the Doctor closes his eyes and meditates for a moment before answering, clearly using some kind of Time Lord ability to see how the timeline has resolved itself.

First, a season finale involves Jack traveling from the future to prevent all of reality from unraveling due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Henry previously going back in time to save his lover</span>. In the following episode, he tries to ensure that his memories of his happy life with Alison come true, but inadvertently puts her off with his familiar attitude. Also, he notes that events are already changing, so the same future will no longer occur. Henry uses a device to erase Jack's memories of the future to spare him the pain, while keeping his own memories (of a slightly different future) intact. Then there's a whole season devoted to the main characters coming back from the 40s with Dr. Grant (who hitched a ride back with them) and seeing the changes made to Eureka. All of them remember the old timeline and try to keep quiet, as Eureka actually has protocols for just such an occurance. Henry is now married. Fargo is the head of Global Dynamics (partly thanks to his grandfather never having been frozen in the past in this reality). Alison's son is no longer autistic. Jack has never broken up with his girlfriend. Notably, the original timeline never gets restored, although Grant tries to alter it once again to no avail.

Raimy remembers the old timeline but now has memories of this new history. However, they're not instant; it takes being told a body has been identified as her mother for Raimy to "remember" her mom vanishing in 1997.
<ul><li> This becomes a major plot point in the episode "Seven Three" when Raimy investigates a crime connected to a shooting from her very first day on the force. She remembers the original timeline where a suspect was killed when her training officer was Stan Moreno. however, Raimy also now remembers that in the altered timeline, Frank was her training officer and the suspect was arrested alive. She's thus able to use both sets of memories to solve the crime.
</li><li> Played for laughs in a later episode when Raimy meets a cop from another district. She's professional, not noting his smile. When he says "you never called me back", Raimy is confused... then has flashes of "memory" of the two having a steamy one-night stand a few weeks earlier.

Interestingly, because Claire's survival is kept a secret from Future Hiro, he doesn't notice a difference between the timeline in which Claire was killed and the one in which she wasn't. Because of this, it's debatable whether he has Ripple-Proof Memory or not - because there's no difference, we wouldn't know if his previous memory was overwritten as soon as he sent Peter to save Claire.

Dan convinces him to talk to his sons about it, so they don't end up blaming themselves in the future. When Dan goes back to the present, he asks his brother about that night and finds out that their father did indeed explain everything to them before leaving. Additionally, when Dan accidentally leaves a digital camera in the past, he comes back to find that not only has computing technology skyrocketed (nanotech is ubiquitous), but his son is now a daughter.

Probably.) Odo did bring a tribble back with him, which would technically mean removing one tribble and its subsequent offspring from the past, but whatever other rules (about, say, transporting a potentially invasive and environmentally destructive species) he might have broken in the process, it doesn't appear to have made any real changes to the timeline. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1e2oj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1e2oj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1e2oj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given that Kirk took two Humpback whales from the 1980s in <em>Star Trek IV</em>, a much bigger impact on the total population of the species (given their limited numbers), and <em>that</em> didn't alter history, it would almost be strange for a single tribble's absence to have any real impact.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em>'s Innerwalkers have this by default. Once someone has been through the Netherworld, they're removed from the timestream, and are thus unaffected by whatever changes are wrought by the chi of the world changing hands. They keep all the memories they have of what the world was like before entering the Netherworld, and thus do not have their memories changed like everyone else's when a shift happens. But the thing is, when something like a critical shift happens, the innerwalker can easily find himself as a much different version of himself from the new timeline, complete with a new name, new history, new enemies and the like, and no one who hasn't been through the Netherworld will remember anything but what the current version of the character is like, leading to <em>serious</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>. Innerwalkers who've gone through one too many critical shifts tend to retreat to the Netherworld full-time, no longer able to deal with living a life they can't recognize with loved ones they've never met.
<ul><li> A pretty good (and amusing) example is given in a supplement of two Innerwalkers who barely knew each other. A critical shift hits, and they find themselves world famous... and <em>married</em>. They're living together now, to keep up the celebrity mega-couple act, and are quite surprised to be slowly falling in love. The shift <em>does</em> suggest that if they had known each other, they'd get married, and they're sure getting to know each other now.
</li><li> Some of the fluff fiction in supplements have characters changing equipment and abilities in a critical shift; a character with arcanowave schticks ending up without the implants and with different schticks after arcanowave tech is eliminated from the timestream, for instance, even though their memories remain. It contradicts the actual rules on what happens to Innerwalkers, but Feng Shui always does play a little fast and loose with rules.

However, the supplement also includes a high-level spell that severs your personal time line, making it so you were immune to any changes made to your past, and so you could overlap your own past.

This means that some of the most spectacular world-changing events in the game setting only happened in continuities that no longer exist, and are only remembered by time travellers and a few other scattered people who somehow manage to remember them.

</li><li> One of the most interesting <em>aversions</em> of this trope is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a></em> games. The main character is a member of the titular Journeyman Project, a government agency which was created in response to the emergence of time travel technology to keep history from being changed. Changes in time create a temporal distortion that travels only forward in time from the moment of the change. One agent is constantly on duty to monitor for such changes; in the event that one occurs, the agent time-jumps back into the time of dinosaurs, a period of history considered "safe" because any changes would wipe out humanity. A record of all events in human history is kept there and can be referenced against a similar record in the future. The differences allow the agent to pinpoint the focal points and prevent the changes. The only reason this works is because the agent and lithmus record are not actually subjected to the ripple.
<ul><li> Only the first one, technically, although this is generally averted. In the later entries, it becomes possible to detect changes to the timeline without the archive disc. The latter is part of the backstory of <em>The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time</em>, where Gage Blackwood (the first game's unnamed Agent 5) is falsely accused of tampering with history for personal gain; the evidence against him consists of mini-temporal distortions originating from several time periods he visited. In the opening of the third game, Agent 3 tries to get the TSA's attention by leaving her <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpSuit">Jump Suit</a> time machine behind, setting off a massive temporal distortion.
</li></ul></li><li> The main party in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>. Anyone that time-travels, for that matter. The fansite "Chrono Compendium" calls this phenomenon "Time-Traveller's Immunity", and extends it to include total immunity to any change that occurs due to their own travel. (Except, oddly, at the beginning of the game when Marle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> prevents her own birth accidentally and subsequently disappears (there is also a joke alternate ending where everyone is turned into a Reptite, and another where Frog becomes Marle's ancestor with newly-apparent effects.</span> But that seems to be the exception in the game, not the rule.)
<ul><li> The most commonly accepted theory is that it was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">The Entity</a> in order to set the rest of the game's events in motion.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a> 2</em>, Monica, the time-traveler from the future, naturally retains her memories of what said future <em>should</em> have been like until Griffon destroyed it from the past. As she and Max work together to restore the future (well, future from Max's perspective, but Monica's <em>past</em>) they run into a small bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">Time-Travel Tense Trouble</a> (for instance, they must create the origin of a factory that Monica remembers as having provided technology to a lab, even though neither the factory nor the lab exists yet.) As they restore these "origin points" and more elements from these locations reappear, inhabitants of restored future villages have no memory of what <em>should</em> have been there, but they do feel that "something is missing" until the village is completed. In the most notable case, a king from the future is astonished at a change in history <em>he</em> doesn't remember, but that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Max's mother</span> Elena, his contemporary, <em>recognizes</em> it as an improvement Max and Monica made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">the past's future known timeline</a> (implying that she is aware of, and remembers, both the original and the improved one.) Meanwhile, their flunkies just roll with it, and presumably their memories were rewritten along with history.
<ul><li> And it goes without saying: although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is defeated in the present (Max's time,) monumental events threaten the world (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Blue Moon turns into the Star of Destruction, and falls from the sky</span>,) and remains of the battle stay there (such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Moon Flower Palace, crashed just outside Palm Brinks</span>) the good guys from the future have no knowledge of any this until it actually occurs.

Taichi and Youko often figure out what's going on, but that is because there is one spot that doesn't reset at the end of every week. Records of past Taichis are kept here. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miki at one point or another also discovered this and began hiding inside it every Sunday in order to avoid the resets.</span> However, Nanaka DOES remember all the past weeks. But, as Taichi notices, she's not really 'there' and isn't exactly looping like the rest.

</li><li> You, the protagonist, have this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MillenniaAlteredDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MillenniaAlteredDestinies">Millennia: Altered Destinies</a></em> by virtue of piloting the XTM, a hyper-advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> capable of traveling through space/time and powered by gravitational energy. Any time you change something, your ship shakes, and your on-board AI warns you of an incoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Temporal Storm</a>. As it happens, you can watch the onboard historical database of the Echelon galaxy and it will instantly change the moment the XTM is hit by the storm. The database is intentionally <em>not</em> shielded from the ripple effect, allowing you to see the outcome of your changes. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the game originally had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> triggered when you would make a change making the game unwinnable, resulting in a massive Temporal Storm destroying the XTM. However, when they realized that such an event was impossible given the mechanics of the game (you can always undo what you've done), they removed this option. The goal of the game is to guide four races to prosperity in the Echelon galaxy by intervening in their histories and setting them on the right course.

The more the main timeline is changed, the more of his life Noel forgets.

Temporarily reversing time allows for correcting mistakes only because you remember what happened the "first time."
</li><li> An interesting case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondSight">Second Sight</a></em>. The protagonist, John Vattic finds himself in a hospital with no memories of his past. The memories come back steadily and he remembers them very vividly (to the point of passing out during the recalls). However, every time he remembers something, he finds that certain things in the present have changed. For example, he looks up the information on his possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> and finds out that she's dead. He then has another flashback (playable), in which he ends up saving her life. After snapping out of the flashback, he looks at the computer again and notes that she's now alive but in a mental institution. Close to the end of the game comes the twist: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the past is actually the present, and the present is actually a possible future he's seeing using his latent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a></span>.

The Great Chasm caused by their arrival in a new world opens at exactly the same point in time in every world, and many of the events which happen in the 'first' world of the game are repeated in a similar fashion in later ones, enabling the characters to intervene where possible and use their knowledge to - eventually - avoid needless conflict.

The current official explanation is that Heroic Spirits (as in, the one recorded in the Throne of Heroes) receives memories of all summoned versions of themselves (Servants). However, in order to prevent the Heroic Spirit from being overwhelmed when summoned as a Servant with conflicting sets of memories, the Throne "dilutes" what they remember when summoned. At bare minimum, the Servant will always remember their past life before death and becoming a Heroic Spirit, but depending on the summoning may recall parts of other previous Servant summonings, particularly ones that have a profound impact on them personally.

<ul><li> Heroes of Time serve the purpose of fixing the timeline whenever someone does something that screws up the delicate balance of time-travel and closed loops that make Sburb and the entire universe capable of existing. These timelines where people fail, called "doomed timelines", invariably end with the eventual death of the people in them, meaning that the Hero of Time often sees themself dying over and over again, all for the sake of their alternate selves taking the fall for their own mistakes. This oversaturation of death's effect on the psyche is played horrifyingly straight in-comic, with all Time characters disturbed in some way by how disposable they are and how they could be the one that's doomed to screw up.

<ul><li> In "The Savage Time," a force field that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> was using to guide a spaceship in for a landing protects him and everyone in it from the effects of a timeline change.
</li><li> In "The Once and Future Thing", the League goes on a time-travelling adventure against Chronos; while several members travel around, only the two that are there when the reset happens remember it. And those two (one of whom is <em>Batman</em>) have to take a moment to recover from the mental whiplash of cutting instantly from a desperate chase through time to... sitting calmly at a cafeteria table, back where it all started. This really complicates things for John / Green Lantern, who remembers meeting his and Hawkgirl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a> even though he's with Vixen at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> had an episode in which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Shendu had used Jackie in a plot to rewrite the history of the world (in a literal, giant Book of History) that more or less canceled all of Shendu's defeats and favors the villains. While in the process of rewriting history, Jade rips a page off the book that mentions her place in history. She keeps this paper so when history is rewritten only she remembers how things were. In this alternative reality Shendu also remembers what things were like, so he is surprised when Jade is able to gather all the main characters to combat him. In the end, the good guys rewrite history to what things were originally like and only they remember this alternative reality.
<ul><li> All humans retain their original memories in that series when history is altered by time-travel even the ones who didn't travel. For example, when Jade accidentally went back to 1976, she prevented Jackie from gaining a scar. While it disappeared from Present Jackie's body, he still remembered it and that clued him to the place in time she went to. When Future Jade came to Present Time to destroy a set of magical teeth so they wouldn't be used to restore Shendu, Future Jackie and Future Uncle still remembered them being used in their time.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a>: A Sitch in Time</em>, where nobody remembers the alternate timeline at the end except Ron has a subconscious aversion to Norwegian fishcakes, and can't figure out why. Played straight earlier in the movie, where Ron is looking at yearbook pictures, and is confused when one of them changes.
</li><li> In an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em> animated series, an enemy uses time travel to slowly reduce the MiB to a small backroom operation. Jay is the only one who notices the changes, as he had been previously affected by an alien device that made him super-intelligent and immune to the ripple effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, Clockwork sets time back two hours before the Nasty Burger incident that would trigger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> so neither Danny's parents nor his teacher Lancer gained knowledge of their once imminent deaths and Danny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>.
<ul><li> In general, though, the protagonists tend to invoke this trope, such as wishing to retain their memories when altering the timeline.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Go God Go XII". Cartman calls his past self, causing several changes to the future world that Cartman apparently doesn't notice. But played straight later in the same episode when Cartman changes the past again and only remembers the old timeline.
</li><li> In the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> where Robotnik, Scratch, Grounder, Sonic and Tails go back to an Ancient Egypt-like era, Scratch and Grounder make it so that two of Sonic's ancestors don't meet, resulting in Sonic not being born. But though Sonic disappears from existence, for plot convenience Tails is still there and remembers him, allowing him to set Sonic's ancestors back up.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Time Keeps On Slippin'", Farnsworth using chronitons to age his atomic supermen from superbabies causes the universe to randomly skip forward in time. Everyone acts normally during the skips, only to suddenly get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> when time starts up again normally. Things get even more confusing when isolated areas begin skipping, which observing characters can see and comment upon.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a> changed Porkbelly's history, he had to take a test about the city's history. He failed it because he remembered the original history and not the new history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DogCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DogCity">Dog City</a></em>: Baron goes back to the time the pilgrims purchased the new world from the natives and made a better offer: squeak toys. This created a Bad Future where he rules. Somehow, Ace and Eddie had this and, after visiting a timeline where Eddie ruled, went back to the past and made an even better offer: a technologically advanced (even for present time standards) fire hydrant the heroes took from the Eddie-ruled timeline.
</li><li> While not being a time travel example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, there are a lot of episodes where Timmy makes wishes that drastically alter the world, and all the characters in the episode act like the world has always been like this, except for Timmy and his fairies. Also, some episodes with time travel play this trope in its natural form.
</li><li> The finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> has the timeline altered so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Nibiru entity never existed</span>. The protagonists remember the original timeline because of their involvement in altering it. More bizarrely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> reveals he'd gained the ability to remember every timeline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat">by writing a lot of science fiction</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Yesteryear". A trip back through the Guardian of Forever changed history by causing Spock to die as a child, before he entered Starfleet. Only the time travelers remembered the original timeline in which Spock existed. Just to add to the confusion it's also averted; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">You Already Changed the Past</a> <em>also</em> applies in this episode, and Spock is able to save himself by realizing that and replicating the actions of who he now realizes is <em>his own cover identity</em> from memory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RandyCunninghamNinthGradeNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RandyCunninghamNinthGradeNinja">Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja</a></em>: When the Sorcerer's past was altered and his eight-century-long imprisonment erased, he still remembered it. Later, when Randy and the original Ninja imprisoned the Sorcerer back in the 13th century, Present-time Sorcerer didn't forget his brief freedom.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em>, Daffy accidentally erased himself from history. As it turns out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">Lezah</a> still remembers him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lezah:</strong> Child, I am not a <em>witch</em> for nothing.
</div></li><li> Archie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries">Archie's Weird Mysteries</a></em> gains this temporarily due to being rendered "out of sync" from the timeline after field-testing Dilton's experimental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Chrono-Field Generator</a>. Good thing too, since this week's villain managed to swipe Dilton's perfected model and is repeatedly resetting time to rob a bank, an act which could result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> and nobody except Archie is able to even notice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Phantom2040" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Phantom2040">Phantom 2040</a></em>. The team receives messages allegedly from the Phantom of 2157 urging him to forsake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">the Phantom's Pledge</a> and kill Rebecca Madison. Guran dismisses the idea of a message from the future, but Archer thinks it's possible. As proof, the future Phantom tells the present characters about a shipment of illegal substances about to come in, which the Phantom of 2040 destroys; Phantom of 2157 sends another message, telling them that as a result of his actions, Cyberville was now constructed 87 days later than before. Archer immediately realises that this proves it's a hoax, since obviously the future Phantom wouldn't remember the unaltered timeline.

The name derives from Nelson Mandela and the fact that many people remember news of him dying in prison many years before his official death in 2013 (in truth, most of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">probably conflating him</a> with fellow anti-Apartheid activist Steve Biko, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryFreedom">a pretty beloved movie</a> to his name). Researchers have discovered psychological factors that can lead to this kind of widespread false memory, but some people remain convinced that it's a sign of some kind of alternate timeline glitch.
