It doesn't matter what their life was like beforehand; their focus in the story revolves around the sole fact that they dig said main character, and the main character digs them. A staple of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre">Harem Genre</a>. When part of a movie, it's usually because the plot revolves around a second love interest that is used to show how much better the Satellite Love Interest is for the protagonist. If a non-satellite character turns into one <em>because</em> they've become a love interest, they've been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToSatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToSatelliteLoveInterest">Demoted to Satellite Love Interest</a>. And pity choice D or E who just loves the character because that's what everyone does in the series, not that they have any chance against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> or even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdOptionLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdOptionLoveInterest">Third-Option Love Interest</a>.

</p><p>Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest">Designated Love Interest</a>, in which a character's characterization isn't involved <em>enough</em> with loving another character, thus making the "love interest" moniker seem tacked-on.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a></em> takes this to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">obvious conclusion</a>. Karen and Tsukihi both have boyfriends, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen">they're never seen once on camera</a>, and the only thing we are told about them is that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">very similar to Koyomi in terms of personality and appearance</a>. Most fans like to make them like Koyomi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">pretend like they don't exist</a>, which, considering the only romantic hints that Karen and Tsukihi have been given in series are with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">brother</a> or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">other girls</a>, may very well be true.
</li><li> Billy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan</a></em> starts off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Character</a> for Julie, until they become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, although even before that it was clear there was something between them and had some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>. That being said, he doesn't have much personality on his own and even when he was under Masquerade's control, he never fought against anyone else besides Julie (well, they're both Subterra users after all).
</li><li> Miho Azuki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, whose only goal apart from becoming a voice actress is getting together with Moritaka Mashiro, and even then, those two goals are intertwined because of her promise to only marry Mashiro when they both achieve their dreams.
</li><li> Princess Charlotte from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> fits this trope to a T. Her only role in the history is being Griffith's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket">Meal Ticket</a> and she seems to only think about him all the time. And for worse, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> <em>punishes</em> her for being such.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em>
<ul><li> Dino basically can be summed up by his crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Maika</a>. This is a weird example as he's actually her and the rest of the cast's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">boss</a>...but he's hardly ever seen doing anything other than being attracted to her, and everyone else seems to treat him as a bumbling, useless idiot, despite being the reason they all met in the first place.
</li><li> Mafuyu's date Itou is even more exaggerated in this regard. The only attribute we know about him is he's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a>. The author doesn't even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">give him a face</a>.

Sakura: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> parody, with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName">embarrassing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">feminine name</a> to boot. Dokuro: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">Magical Girlfriend</a> parody, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> deconstruction. Zakuro: Parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower">Eyepatch of Power</a>, which is never even mentioned, let alone explained. Etc., etc.
</li><li> Chii in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em> is literally this since she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> without an operating system and her entire personality starts from scratch. Later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashbacks</a> to when she wasn't yet a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> show that her personality can be much deeper (and it can possibly become like that again).
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>. Main character Ganta is trapped in a prison whose inhabitants are, by and large, not very nice people, when he meets a painfully shy and sensitive girl who clings to him from the word "hello." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Minatsuki is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">psychopathic killer</a> who puts on the nice-girl persona and then gets sexual pleasure from the look of betrayal on her victims' faces right before she kills them. She <em>is</em> starting to get a little better, though.</span>
</li><li> Sonosuke Izayoi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> has very little character outside of being Ruruka's extremely devoted boyfriend. He even gets expelled from Hope's Peak over his association with her despite doing nothing!
</li><li> Misa Amane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is an interesting illustration of this trope. She's dedicated to her career as an idol and her "job" punishing the guilty, so she can't quite be called shallow... but where Light is concerned, she's shallower than any <em>five</em> other examples on this page. Her willingness to submit to his slightest whim is so extreme it's scary. It's certainly possible to picture her without Light — we see her before they meet, and she's clever and dangerous. But <em>after</em> they meet, she'd rather die than live any kind of life without him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And she apparently <em>does</em> in the ending of the anime, when you see her standing on the <em>wrong side</em> of a guardrail...</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan">The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan</a></em>, a spin-off manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, turns <em>the protagonist of the main series</em> into this. Kyon's tendency to be passive stays, while the observational narration is gone, so he has little to show other than caring for Yuki.
</li><li> There are two of note in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise, both of them intentional examples. First is Maron, Krillin's first girlfriend in Z (and practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">clone of Bulma</a>) that appeared during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc">Garlic Jr. Saga</a>, but Krillin broke it off because she thought she was too good for him. Then in GT, Goten was seen on a date with Valese, a girl that got perplexed by ice cream... on a cone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Both are ditzes</a>.
</li><li> Nyu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>; like Chii, Nyu is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate">Blank Slate</a>, picked up by Kouta from a beach. Possibly a subversion, in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nyu's attraction to Kouta is a reflection of her second personality Lucy, a borderline psychopathic mass murderer with real, complex, and disturbingly heartbreaking reasons for loving him</span>.
</li><li> Yuno from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> basically has no personality outside of her devotion to Yukiteru. This is played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">as straight as possible</a> to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">her</a> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">scary</a></strong> while being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> of the trope. Her entire world revolves around Yukiteru, and if anyone threatens to take him away from her, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">flips her shit</a> and equates it to her entire future being taken away. This is with good reason: before meeting Yukiteru, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuno had just killed her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>, who were sitting dead in her house for three weeks. She had absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">no hope for her own future</a>, and was deeply moved when Yukiteru's hope for the future was for his family to get along</span>. So when Yukiteru jokingly accepted her offer to become his bride, she was thrilled <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since she finally had a reason to keep living her life</span> — her life very literally depends on having Yukiteru there for emotional support, he <em>is</em> her future <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after she lost everything</span>. It gets even more interesting in that Yuno <em>recognizes</em> this fact and basically gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason We Suck" Speech</a> about how it was "pretend love" and she would have been fine with <em>anyone</em> as long as she could emotionally depend on him. Fortunately, it turns out that maybe their love isn't that meaningless after all.
</li><li> Poor, poor Tamahome from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a>.</em> In the early episodes of the series, he had hints of a backstory (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">Money Fetish</a> was due to growing up poor and wanting to provide for his siblings and ailing father). However, said backstory (as well as everything else about his character) was seen as secondary compared to his love for Miaka. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Suboshi kills his entire family in cold blood</span>, and he embraces this trope for all its worth. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">Money Fetish</a> is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and everything about his personality shifts to accommodate to Miaka's needs. When he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticingTheFourthWall">realizes that he is a character from a book</a>, he tells Miaka that this doesn't matter because he "was created solely to love her." This line was meant to come across as romantic, but it <em>actually</em> wound up highlighting just how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">pathetic excuse he was for a character.</a>

</li><li> Midori from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/GreenGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/GreenGreen">Green Green</a></em>. If she weren't allowed to squeal "Yuusuke" every ten seconds, she would lose her reason for existence.
</li><li> The love interests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em> are like this. Emily (first generation), Romary (second), and Wendy (third) have very little role or development outside of fretting that generation's protagonist. Once the generation shifts and they become mothers, their role in the plot effectively ends. Romary probably has the most development, as she's in a mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> and gets some expansion in the <em>Memory of Eden</em> OVA.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita">Battle Angel Alita</a></em>. In an argument with Alita over her choice to become a Hunter-Warrior, Ido lets it slip that he revived her with the expectation that she would be one of these. Alita, like any sane person, would be upon hearing this, <em>is pissed</em>.
</li><li> Koutarou Azumamiya of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> used to be this for Hinagiku originally, and the anime even added a few episodes of this to him, but since the second year started, he's actually gotten some character of his own.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyCrush">Honey Crush</a></em> it never becomes very clear why the two other girls are so heavily in love with Madoka (one of them even continues to do so after her death, turning her into a ghostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>). Sure, Madoka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">might be pretty</a>, but her personality remains elusive throughout the series.
</li><li> Shino from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ichiroh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ichiroh">Ichiroh!</a></em> is a comedic example, as it's a gag series and can get away with it. She's never seen away from Nanako and almost all she does is lust over her. It doesn't help that she's also a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> with a pinch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> at her worst.
</li><li> Hojo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> is a male example of this. Of course, we don't see him enough for him to have much of a personality. And he exists for the sake of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> rather than actual romantic tension.
</li><li> Tsubasa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. There's a reason he's constantly referred to as "Kashiwagi's Boyfriend", even after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivenNameReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivenNameReveal">Given Name Reveal</a>. Nearly every appearance he makes centers around her in some fashion. Even when he went to the Student Council, <em>alone</em>, he ends up talking more about Kashiwagi than he does about himself.
</li><li> Something similar happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu">Kamichu!</a></em>, where Yurie is much closer to Matsuri than her supposed love interest Kenji.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer">Kämpfer</a></em>'s Natsuru Senou is the rare case of a Satellite Love Interest who is <em>the main character</em>. He is primarily defined by his rather basic crush on Kaede. When someone asks him in episode 8 why he likes Kaede so much, he first refers to her beauty and elegance. When it's brought up that most of the girls he knows are also beautiful and elegant, all he can do is shrug his shoulders and say that you "don't need a reason to love someone". Seriously, the guy has no personality outside of his crush and his frustration with his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> status. On the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaede herself has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a></span>

Her main personality trait is... she's a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">Girl Next Door</a>. And a huge reason why Tsuna has a crush on her is that she was the only girl who bothered being nice to him in 12 months.

Sora is supportive of Najika no matter what, and knows just what to say to help cheer her up... and then it's revealed he was told to get close to her to further the director's goals.

</li><li> Yuuno from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> is effectively treated this way by the creators, despite actually having a developed personality, loads of plot-potential, and plenty of combat power. Beyond his use as a romantic possibility for Nanoha, the writers simply were not interested in developing anything more about him; they don't even explain where or how he gained Raising Heart. So when they decided, as of <em>Sound Stage X</em>, not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> Yuuno with Nanoha anymore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherChuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherChuck">he disappeared entirely from the plot and never receives another mention</a>.

He further explained that he threw Sakura in the middle of Naruto and Sasuke in order to exacerbate their rivalry and create a "messy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>", and that she was never intended to be a special female character and she was at the same level as supporting characters like Kiba or Shikamaru.
</li><li> Karin is one for Sasuke. Even though her heritage has been revealed, her character solely exists as a parody of Sasuke's fangirls.
</li><li> Rin Nohara. The only real characterization which she receives is the fact that Obito loves her but she loves Kakashi. This may be justified since she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a> so she isn't exactly around to receive characterization, and the main reason for her existence is in order to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">The Lost Lenore</a> for Obito and motivate him to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tobi</a>.

<ul><li> Izumi is this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">both Kazusa and Niina</a>. All we know about him that doesn't have anything to do with either of the two girls is that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailEnthusiast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailEnthusiast">he likes trains a lot</a>.

</li><li> Amagi is this to Sonezaki. This becomes blatantly apparent right from his first appearance, where Sonezaki asks him to write a report explaining why exactly he confessed to her. The only reason he can give is "because she's cute" repeated over and over. His own distinct character traits of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> but laid back and down-to-earth are only ever brought up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">to contrast him</a> with the straightlaced and highstrung honor student Sonezaki.
</li><li> Yamagishi-sensei has one in the form of his fellow teacher Tomita. All that's really ever known about her is that she's kind and caring, and that he's totally smitten with her. The main extent of her in-story role is to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher">Hitoha</a> someone to angst about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">being inferior to</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere">Onidere</a></em> is special because <em>both protagonists</em> could be defined as Satellite Love Interests. Literally no action, thought or monologue in the entire Manga is in no way not connected, even a little, to please and/or become more intimate with their loved one. Hell, the first true show of love in the manga is Saya nearly fainting because Tadashi praised her food while Tadashi <em>fainted</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal">because a single spoon of said food can cause pain equally to a full session of torture</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">he ended the entire meal to make Saya smile</a>.

Predictably, this pisses off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Kyousuke</a> to no extent...until Kirino finally reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">it was all an act</a> to make him as jealous as possible, to get back at him for making her feel horribly jealous when he was dating Kuroneko.

</li><li> Saya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane">Peacemaker Kurogane</a></em>. She pretty much exists only to be Tetsunosuke's love interest. She fits very much with the question, "What would her personality be if she never met the male lead?" Nothing. Come on, we know she's mute and all, but even mute people have personalities and quirks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>'s Serena started her journey to join Ash, mainly acts as support, and cooks him food. The writers seemed to have taken note of this; during the first season of <em>XY</em>, while she had no life goal at the time, she <em>was</em> still searching for her purpose in life. She eventually finds one near the end of that season, deciding to become a Pokémon Performer, and spends the rest of <em>XY</em> acting upon that goal.

At one point, she claims to have memorized the names of a bunch of flowers in Oriko's garden, but when Oriko admits to not caring about flowers much, Kirika says she'll forget about it from now on.

Most of her scenes in the series revolve entirely around her crush on main character Fuutarou, with the sole exception of her interest in Sengoku warlords, and even that trait sees less and less reference as time goes on. Almost every action she takes usually begins with the question "Will this impress Fuutarou or make him like me more?" up to and including future career paths (in this instance, choosing to try and become a baker, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>, because she wants to show Fuutarou that she can improve and make him happy, with no thoughts at all to her established interests in history).

This is entirely justified, as she is an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">artificial person created to protect the true Moka</span> and Outer Moka is aware of this, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">even does her best</a> to put aside her own feelings to pair up Tsukune and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inner Moka</span>, albeit this is far more explicitly done in the manga as opposed to the anime. And, to further the inversion (again, in the manga at least), the two of them have worked together to support each other in regards to Tsukune, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inner Moka</span>'s wishes and intents are kept the primary consideration.

Literally, her whole personality is about stalking her love interest (hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">her name</a>). What would she be like if she didn't meet the protagonist? Stalking other guys that catch her interest.

To elaborate, love interests in this series tend to have very thin to no identities because their existences are solely based on Makoto Itou to make him look like a typical saint-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre">Harem Genre</a> protagonist. In reality, Makoto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">is far from being a saint</a>, and the heroines' misjudgment and obsession toward him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">drive them either into despair or insanity when they realize Makoto only thinks of them as sex toys</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara!</a></em>, Amu's crush on Tadase started out based on looks and really nothing more because she'd never spoken to him. Later on in the series, Amu's feelings for Tadase develop into her liking him based on his personality once she gets to know him.
</li><li> For the most part, Alpha Omega Nova of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco">Space Patrol Luluco</a></em> is just a pretty face over whom Luluco's obsessed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's later invoked, as his primary goal was to manifest the most worthless thing in existence: the shallow love of an especially foolish girl.</span>

While she does have other character traits, Himespetchi is mostly identified by her crush on Mametchi and some of her other characteristics wind up helping her to drive the message home even further (e.g. she shows an interest in robotics and takes the Robotics class in Dream School... to be with Mametchi, who is also in that class). However, the relationship is one-sided, with Mametchi being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">completely unaware of her affections</a>.

She spends the first 3/4ths of the first season as a character whose sole character traits were being a bitchy Neeba fangirl. This changes later on, where we get an episode where she and the main character are stranded together and bond a little, removing her from Neeba and giving viewers a bit more insight into her character. She never really goes back to being a complete Neeba fangirl after that. To add to things, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neeba offers Fatina and Fatina alone an invitation to join him and Kaaya after they betray their groups.

Sadly, despite nearly every other supporting character being well developed over the decades, Sif's stories have focused almost exclusively on Thor with only a few making an attempt to give her any personality beyond that. A notable exception being the 2012-2013 run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JourneyIntoMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JourneyIntoMystery">Journey into Mystery</a></em> which had Sif as its main character. The writer, Kathryn Immonen, explored Sif's personality and embarked her on various badass (and mostly Thor-unrelated) adventures. Sadly, the series was then cancelled due to low sales.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin Series</a></em>: Not much is known about Zo besides the fact that she gained a crush on Tim while tutoring him and started dating him, does well in school, is considered attractive by some of the other students and is heartbroken when he breaks up with her over the phone. She gets slightly more character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Red Robin</a> just by showing her anger at people who've given up on the now missing Tim while she tries to help find him, her friendship with him and her acceptance that he's moved on from their relationship even if she gets irritated at hearing about him dating and has to visibly decide to just let it go.
</li><li> It took until the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor">Steve Trevor</a> to significantly evolve into someone other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s boyfriend (the fact that they break up helps). He had manages to be a compelling character in his own right while being her boyfriend in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Golden Age</a> but subsequent writers didn't know what to do with him other than use him as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessBoyfriend">designated victim</a>.
</li><li> A number of examples from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>:
<ul><li> Marla Madison was a scientist who built a Spider-Slayer for J. Jonah Jameson, who subsequently fell in love with her and eventually married her. Since Dr. Madison stopped building Spider-Slayers, she gradually settled down into this position as few writers seemed to be interested in developing her as a character. As she was one of several characters to be fridged in post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> stories, there is now little chance of that being rectified.
</li><li> Cissy Ironwood was a Satellite Love Interest created especially for <em>Marvel Team-Up</em> in the early 1980s so that the writers of that could write stories in which Spider-Man ditched his date in order to fight the villain of the month without having to keep track of the latest romantic developments in the other two Spider-books.
</li><li> Carlie Cooper was supposed to be "perfect" for Peter Parker. The problem was, she was kind of quickly introduced and then forgotten about for a significant amount of time while the rotating writers focused on their pet characters. When she reappeared, a lot of her appearances consisted of everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">talking about how super awesome she was--even those who had never met her before</a>. If this weren't bad enough, she appeared in an issue titled "The Many Loves Of Spider-Man" before they were even dating. When they finally got together Peter declared it was "the rightest thing in the world" (despite the fact she was dressed up as his ex). What few personality traits could be assigned to her were seemingly all sewn together from other love interests that were much better-developed characters. She and Peter had a laughable lack of any actual chemistry, she was named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a>'s daughter, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">no one could decide what she looked like</a>. Not to mention, she was quite obviously meant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">replace fan-favorite Mary Jane Watson</a>, whom Joe Quesada infamously dislikes. She quickly became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> and when she and Peter broke up during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland">Spider-Island</a> the fandom rejoiced. She's still in the books, but now they're focusing more on her job as a crime scene investigator, where more of an assignable personality can surface.
</li></ul></li><li> Sadie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman">Starman</a></em> has no character outside of her relationship with Jack and worrying about her brother.

</li><li> Laurie Juspezyk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> was employed by the US government essentially to be one of these for Dr. Manhattan after she quit her old job in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> business. She actually <em>does</em> have a personality, and it winds up conflicting to some extent with her mission of keeping Manhattan focused/sane/<em>human</em> because of the fact that he's too much the first of those and not enough the third upsets her, which in turn upsets <em>him</em>.
<ul><li> The prequel miniseries <em>Minutemen</em> features Norbert Veldon, Nelson Gardner's "friend" who presumably helped him recover after losing his beloved Hooded Justice. Veldon briefly shows up at Hollis Mason's shop to threaten him with a lawsuit unless he stops writing his memoirs, claiming that the advance copy that he sent Gardner has upset him (we later find out that specifically, Gardner's turmoil stems from the part of the memoirs where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mason confesses to killing Hooded Justice and suggests that HJ was behind the circus kidnappings that Nite Owl and Silhouette had investigated</span>. The miniseries also features Gretchen, Ursula Zandt's partner and personal physician, although she's somewhat more developed, as we learn much of her backstory when Nite Owl gets ahold of her and Silhouette's notes.

Oddly enough, PJ's girlfriend in the sequel, who suffers from both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">No Name Given</a> and limited screentime, is probably the biggest aversion among the movies' love interests.

Julian the mammoth is a lesser example, as he actually gets some decent screentime <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and helps make the final push to save the day</span>, but his character almost entirely revolves around his upcoming marriage with Peaches, which also drives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Manny's</a> character arc for the movie.
</li><li> Tony in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em>, who shows up at the beginning and the end of the film and mainly exists as Violet's crush. In fact, he only really exists to demonstrate <em>Violet's</em> character development. At the beginning of the film, she's too shy to even remain visible in his presence. In the end, she's able to talk with him and get a date while <em>he's</em> stammering nervously. He only gets slightly better in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2">Incredibles 2</a></em>; we learn he plays sports and music and works part-time at his parents' diner, but he still exists solely as Violet's love interest.
</li><li> Celia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>. Aside from being Mike's love interest and the company secretary, she doesn't have much characterization.

That doesn't stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a>. The second movie <em>really</em> puts it in lights: his introduction to the film is to come in and nervously ask the Mane Six's human counterparts if Twilight's come back lately. (You know, Twilight, the <em>princess</em> from <em>another world</em> that won't be accessible for <em>months</em>, and who really has <em>no</em> reason to <em>ever</em> return?) It's the one scene where you'd expect his actions would <em>have</em> to come from his non-Twilight-related traits, so it's pretty glaring when the answer to "What is he when not being the love interest?" is "that guy who randomly shows up to ask if Twilight has inexplicably returned." He just <em>isn't a character</em> in his own right.
<ul><li> It's emphasized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even further</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Friendship Games</a></em> where his only role is to be shot down by Human Twilight twice, showing how unimportant he is without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>. Interestingly, <em>Friendship Games</em> and <em>Legend of Everfree</em> having him get shot down moves him into a new role that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> him as this sort of character: now that Twilight's human counterpart is part of the gang and Pony Twilight is not in the movies anymore, and after Sunset Shimmer telling him straight that <em>this</em> Twilight isn't <em>that</em> Twilight and he needs to move on (and then going on with the plot and not noticing Flash trying to get back with her), poor Flash's role in the story is now "generic love-interest-y person <em>without someone to be a generic love interest to.</em>" He pops up to fulfill his role in life as the guy who occasionally interrupts the plot to smile cutely and be smiled at in return... and there's no one who needs him for that, leaving him to give the same sad look. It's actually earned him a bit of sympathy from those who'd hated him, and Derpy being the one to pat him on the shoulder in those scenes has given him someone to be shipped with as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Princess Fiona from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> series started off as a parody of this trope; she insisted in the first film that her role was to be the stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> princess who literally just waited until a handsome prince came to rescue her. Subverted later when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">grew to love Shrek for who he is</a>. In fact, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekForeverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShrekForeverAfter">Shrek Forever After</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">we actually get to see what Fiona would have become</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">if she had never been rescued</a>.

Sure, she's sweet and has a bit of a naughty side, but both those traits are used in order to demonstrate her affection for Woody (grabbing him around the neck with her shepherdess's crook, for example). She never really interacts with any other toy on-screen and she exists mainly as a sympathetic ear to Woody. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bo Peep's lack of development — and the popularity of the other female characters, Jessie the Cowgirl and the tour guide Barbie doll from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2">Toy Story 2</a></em>, and the logistics of having Bo Peep actually be involved in the action of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">the third movie</a> (given that she wasn't actually a toy at all, but a china figurine) — were the reason why she didn't appear in the third movie.</span>

Unlike Vanessa and Felicity, whose roles were more intertwined with Austin's; Foxy's character was limited to being "the token female that Austin kisses before the credits run". This may have been a side-effect of <em>Goldmember</em> focusing more on Austin's relationship with his father as opposed to him falling in love.

</li><li> Jennifer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> trilogy. She appeared very little in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">first movie</a> and apparently existed only so that Marty would have someone to spill exposition on in the opening scenes. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale tried to write her out of the sequels, but the way they ended the first movie made that difficult; she did get some development in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">second</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">third</a> movies.

</li><li> Marianne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked">The Boat That Rocked</a></em> has no consistent personality in her ten minutes total screen time except to be an object of adoration for the teenage protagonist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She almost immediately breaks his heart by sleeping with another guy on their 'date', but they get back together in the last 15 minutes with practically no apology and no explanation from her.</span>

In spite of the plot focusing on the build-up and traditions of his and Lilian's wedding, he has very little characterization beyond being her fiance to the point that his <em>sister</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaMcCarthy">Meg</a>, has much more screentime than he does.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cherry2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cherry2000">Cherry 2000</a></em>, the title character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> with a <em>very</em> limited AI (she probably wouldn't pass a Turing Test). The whole plot of the movie is the hero's trek to find a body to replace her lost one. She only appears for a few minutes of the movie and is unceremoniously dumped to save the female tracker who the hero fell in love with during the journey. Since she's a sexbot, she's more or less <em>supposed</em> to be this, as dumping her in favor of a real person is character development; if she had a personality it would be more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment.
</li><li> Casey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chronicle">Chronicle</a></em> is notable in that being a Satellite Love Interest was a cover for her actual role in the film; to provide another camera for the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms">Found Footage</a> style. Ironically, she clearly has more depth than he does near the start, and they seem to have some offscreen development of their relationship.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIronHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</a></em> is a drama about the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. The hero is an idealistic Pony Express rider and son of a railroad surveyor, who does battle against an evil land speculator and his corrupt engineer sidekick. Eventually, the hero defeats the bad guys and the railroad is built. He also has a girlfriend. Sometimes, this girlfriend is shown onscreen, looking pretty, and occasionally urging the hero not to fight, but mostly looking pretty.
</li><li> Surprisingly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zigzagged all around</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> films - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Honey Ryder</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">Melina Havelock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">Natalya Simyonova</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe">Anya Amasova</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Wai Lin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Vesper Lynd</a> and <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">Tracy Vincenzo</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later Bond</span> are anything but static. On the other hand, there have been others, often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman">ones who die early on</a>, who are the epitome of this trope, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Tiffany Case</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">Mary Goodnight</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker">Holly Goodhead</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">Stacey Sutton</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid">The Karate Kid</a></em> movies:

</li><li> Averted (but barely) by Kumiko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKidPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKidPartII">The Karate Kid Part II</a></em>, who is shown to have her own dream of becoming a classical Japanese dancer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She's written out of the third movie, and the in-story reason is that she chose said dream over being with Daniel.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Katie Deauxma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, who is every bit Dave's dream girl to the core, even to the point of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">immediately forgiving him for pretending to be gay and having sex with him right afterward, plus having sex just about anywhere — including on a dumpster</span>. She is given an occupation and her interest in comics is touched upon, but her entire character ultimately centers around being Dave's perfect girlfriend. The most important role she plays aside from that is sending Dave after Razul, which leads to him meeting other important characters.
</li><li> Jocelyn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale">A Knight's Tale</a></em>. She's beautiful, rich, likes clothes, loves William... and that's it. All the poor girl gets to do is stand on the sidelines and then have either a love scene or a fighting scene with Will. Though she's lucky enough to even get moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">witty lines</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">displays of spunk.</a> She also kind of lampshades this. Her initial rejection of Will is based on him treating her like this, as every knight who was smitten with her pretty face has done. She asks him to think of her as a person, not a prize, and when he <em>does</em> she falls for him. Not that the audience gets to know her very well, she still fits the trope for us. And the fact that the ones who point it out the most among fandom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">are Kate and Will/Kate shippers</a> says a lot...
</li><li> Tina Carlyle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em>. To the point that they had to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reveal that the other half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span> in order to find a good, non-sexual reason why Stanley should prefer her in the end.
</li><li> Aaron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em> is a rare male version. He pretty much solely exists to be a pretty (and gullible) face and stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Cady and Regina.

</li><li> Bonnie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyAngelsHaveWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyAngelsHaveWings">Only Angels Have Wings</a></em>. The story is about Geoff the studly pilot and his fellow studly pilots, and their dinky little airline that makes highly dangerous flights over the Andes and back. Bonnie arrives in town for...some reason the movie never specifies. She has a job doing...something the movie never specifies. She falls in love with Geoff. The pilots continue to make perilous flights into the interior of South America and back; tragedy strikes and new friendships are formed. At the end Bonnie is—still in love with Geoff, having hung around throughout the movie but hardly affecting the story at all.
</li><li> Jane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PumaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PumaMan">Puma Man</a></em>. A character so lacking in personality that she barely qualifies as a cardboard cutout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveYourLegs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveYourLegs">Save Your Legs!</a></em>: The only personality traits Anjali displays are her interest in Teddy, and her love of cricket (although the latter does play a role in the film's resolution). Tellingly, she is a character created for the dramatization and had no equivalent in the real world events that inspired the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stardust">Stardust</a></em>, Tristan would do absolutely anything to win Victoria's heart, though she's due to marry another man. And that's pretty much all we know about her. As his relationship with Yvaine the fallen star grows, Yvaine even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out that she's not exactly proving her love to him the way he is to her...</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and eventually, he figures this out himself and dumps her for Yvaine.</span>
</li><li> Whatsherface, Joan, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarfighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarfighters">The Starfighters</a></em>. The whole movie is an endless stream nothing of interest happening to incredibly uninteresting people, and she does not disappoint.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy">TRON: Legacy</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaWilde">Olivia Wilde</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">went out of her way</a> to ensure that her character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Quorra</a> didn't get saddled with this. We see the beginnings of an attraction between the Sam and Quorra once they get to know each other a bit better on the Solar Sailer, which is probably a more natural true-to-life progression than this trope: they only recently met.

</li><li> Male examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em>. Lucy's suitors function in the story as little more than that. Arthur (who is the one that gets the girl) only hopes for Lucy's affections and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mourns her death</span>. Quincey doesn't get the girl and only contributes owning a hunting knife to the fight with Dracula <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">getting killed off</a> so Dracula could kill someone</span>.

They're only in a relationship because their parents decided to betroth them, and she can't stand him because he's utterly shallow. Most of their interactions consist of her trying to get out of the marriage or trying to convince him to go away after she moves in with a dragon to get out of the marriage and he tries to rescue her. Once she finally gets rid of him (by convincing him to rescue an equally shallow princess being held by a different dragon instead) he only ever gets mentioned when she's explaining to other people how she got him to leave.

This has far-reaching consequences by the end of the story.
</li><li> Bryce Loski of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flipped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flipped">Flipped</a></em> is a subversion. Juli is only interested in him for superficial reasons, and her family sees him as a pretty shallow person. In reality, he's got lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>, he's just also a raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> who deliberately projects his shallow image to cover up how bad things are at home.

</li><li> Daisy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></em> is actually pretty well developed, she's just actually genuinely static. Jordan Baker acts this trope, but hints at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> frequently (not to mention some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">believe her to be a lesbian</a>).

His life and career literally revolve around her. Still, he ends up doing a lot more than usual for this trope due to said career being "high-ranking knight".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">A Princess of Mars</a></em> has John Carter do things beyond the impossible all for his relatively basic love for Dejah Thoris. In the entire ten-book canon, Dejah Thoris' characterization never really gets much beyond "beautiful princess who loves John Carter." The only books in which she actually gets to do anything are the first (<em>Princess</em>) and the eighth (<em>Swords</em>). In books two and three (<em>Gods</em> and <em>Warlord</em>) she's essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, she spends almost the entirety of book nine (<em>Synthetic Men</em>) in a coma, and in the other five she makes only a cameo appearance at the end (and sometimes in the beginning as well), with the bulk of the story being about a different couple (Carter himself is a significant character in only one of the five, <em>Llana of Gathol</em>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, Jeyne Westerling is Robb Stark's Satellite Love Interest. Her entire role in the plot is for Robb Stark to first sleep with her when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace">mourning the supposed deaths of his brothers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal">marry her to preserve her honor</a> and in the process break his vow to Walder Frey, and all she talks about is how to be a good wife to Robb. (The fact that there are no point-of-view chapters for Robb explains this somewhat; we never see the two of them interact one-on-one, so we don't know what their relationship is really like.)
<ul><li> Jeyne's simplicity is most likely one of the reasons why the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> writers cut her out and replaced her with a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> for Robb who, admittedly, is a better developed character: a field nurse who maintains a strong opinion <em>against</em> the war and is quite intelligent in her own right. It's easier to buy that Robb would break his engagement to a girl he's never met for her.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em> and its spin-offs. It was almost guaranteed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">once a book</a> Elizabeth, Jessica or both would meet a new love interest who led her into some sort of scheme or caused her to become torn between him and her loyal regular boyfriend. Steven and other supporting characters got Satellite Love Interests too.
</li><li> The White Queen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign">The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign</a></em> plays with this. While she is indeed Kyousuke's love interest, and all of her thoughts are related to him in some way, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">her actions in the past</a>, Kyousuke absolutely refuses to be with her again, and is devoted to trying to kill her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the most bizarre examples of this trope can be found in the concept of "imprinting", in which males "recognize" the females that they are destined to fall in love with — which can occur as early as childbirth (in fact, Jacob imprinted on Bella's child before she was even conceived). Many of these female imprintees are "basic" by default considering they're infants or toddlers and thus have no fixed personalities at all. Their lives revolve entirely around their future husbands, considering the teenage boys appear to become their caregivers until they're of marriageable age, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">whether the girls ''want'' to be in these relationships is treated as somewhat irrelevant in the text</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">They are future wives, nothing more</a>. In-universe, it's explained that the boys become anything and everything that the girls want. They literally live and breathe to make their imprints happy. So they're satellites as well.
</li><li> One example of this was when Jacob came across his friend Quil (a teenage boy) on a date with Claire (a two-year-old) at the beach, which involved Quil just watching as Claire played in the sand.
</li><li> Also, Bella Swan, our romantic heroine and POV character herself. We never learn much about her life in Phoenix, and although she easily makes friends at the beginning of the first novel, she immediately dumps them to be with Edward. Her whole life revolves around Edward, to the point where she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">actually goes catatonic</a> when he leaves her, and in the last book <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she turns into a vampire, and completely leaves her human life behind her for a life with her Edward.</span> She also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">no character development</a> at all throughout the books. At one point her mother literally compares Bella to a satellite around Edward—always orientating herself to always be near him—and Bella can't give even one excuse as she even admits that Renee is totally correct.

</li><li> Silverstream from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>. She never appeared in <em>Into the Wild</em> (not even as an apprentice or at least in the allegiances), and her first appearance in the second book was only to rescue Graystripe from drowning. She never had an appearance where it didn't involve another more important character, and the only notable thing she did outside of bearing Graystripe's kits was getting Firestar in touch with cats who knew something about Redtail's death.

In these cases, the writers didn't shy away from complexities or situations that sometimes made the characters look bad. However, concurrent with the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Olicity</a>, female characters in more recent seasons are mostly defined by their relationship with Oliver, and Felicity is a prime example of that.

</li><li> Oz began like this - entirely as a love interest for Willow. But when he became a werewolf, it allowed him to have plotlines that didn't involve being Willow's boyfriend.
</li><li> Buffy's season 4 boyfriend Riley Finn existed on the show to only be Buffy's love interest after Angel, and while he did play an important role in the Initiative Plot, that role was just to give their relationship more "drama". It's really not that surprising that, come season 5 when the writers realized he had nothing interesting to do, they promptly got rid of him.

<ul><li> Dr. Peyton Driscoll has hints of this. She had the potential to be a great character, as a medical examiner she was obviously smart, but the writers ruined this by making her very first scene one of her in bed with Mac. Later on, it seemed virtually every scene with her had to be connected to Mac in some way.
</li><li> Christine. Some feel she hasn't been fleshed out enough or given enough personality to allow people to relate well to her, and she's a bit too perfect to seem real or that she's a written a bit too much like Mac's perfect woman. She's quick to forgive Mac for initially shutting her out somewhat from his aphasia problem and that in several scenes, she's been sitting in her restaurant with the door open after hours, even in dangerous New York, as though just waiting for Mac, even the time when she hadn't been answering her phone and wouldn't have known he would be coming over.

This is pretty prevalent in season 3 where the only women who are more than just love interests to anyone end up being Karen, and Nadeem's boss Tammy Hattley.
<ul><li> Foggy's girlfriend Marci Stahl has shades of this for the first two seasons since she only ever interacts with Foggy, and the only time she has interactions with someone who isn't Foggy is in her intro scene, where in addition to Foggy, she also gets to interact with Karen; as well as a few lines with Foggy's family in episode 9 of season 3.
</li><li> Elektra gets shades of this in season 2, since a lot of her characterization is built around her relationships with the male figures in her life, namely her ex-boyfriend (Matt) and her surrogate father/sensei (Stick), and those are the two people she primarily interacts with. Many believe this negatively affected her, as it meant other character traits, like the whole matter of her being the Black Sky, never got the focus they needed.

<ul><li> Understandably, due to time constraints and the large cast of leads and supporting characters from the solo shows being juggled around, there were going to be out of focus and sidelined. But this is most apparent with Karen Page, as outside of a single interaction with Trish Walker, her interactions are primarily with Matt or with Foggy. The same goes for Malcolm and Trish, who only interact with each other and with Jessica.
</li><li> Claire Temple gets hit a bit with this. After having been integral to linking the standalone shows together, <em>The Defenders</em> treats her primarily as Luke's love interest, and never allows her to do her medical work onscreen. The show barely even acknowledges until a conversation between Claire and Foggy that she had past romantic history with Matt for a bit back in <em>Daredevil</em> season 1, and no acknowledgment of the role Jessica played in the season 1 finale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">her show</a> in bringing Luke and Claire together.

<ul><li> Danny Pink in the 2014 series qualifies. Although he has a rather well-developed backstory (an Afghanistan war veteran with PTSD and one episode features the Doctor and Clara meeting him as a child when he lived in an orphanage), in terms of his relationship with Clara we don't see very much of what he does outside said relationship other than giving Clara a shoulder to cry on when things get a bit rough with the Doctor and occasionally letting his PTSD get the better of him in front of his students. Primarily, he refuses to go on any adventures with her, which enforces his satellite status as this prevents him from becoming directly involved in the mandate of the series - except for two key exceptions, one of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">doesn't end well for Danny</a>.

She pretty much disappeared after that and she and Dean made no onscreen attempts to patch things up, with Jo making only one more appearance in the season where her feelings for Dean were mocked by the villain of the episode, she was told point-blank that Dean only saw her as a little sister and not a love interest, and the villain even suggested Dean would let her die rather than risk hurting Sam. After Dean saves her, she helps Dean out and offers to come with him as backup, but he refuses and when he walks out telling her he'll call her, Jo's last line for the next two seasons is a quiet "No you won't." Her inclusion in the episode is basically the writers admitting defeat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">sinking the ship</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that Jo was originally conceived as a love interest for Dean and that she was phased out of the series due to negative fan reaction, which explains the rapid scrapping of her original characterization.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Luann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Luann">Luann</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aaron Hill, Luann's longtime crush object. Very pretty... and that's it. Even attempts at giving him depth (the revelation of his relationship with legally-adult Dianne) only served to underline what little personality he had.
</li><li> There was an arc where Luann was spending a lot of time with Gunther, only for the end of the arc to reveal that it had been Aaron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">in disguise</a> the whole time, trying to teach her a lesson about judging on appearances vs. actual merits. It's telling that, aside from disguise time, the most interaction the two had was Aaron berating Luann for missing the point when she asked to try on the Gunther mask.
</li><li> Aaron ended up getting more depth with later stories, though that ended up being negated when he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>. But he has nothing on the blandness of Quill, who is handsome and... Australian. And that's about it.
<ul><li> And when Quill finally gained some personality in the form of a love of theater, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Luann ended up dumping him for not paying enough attention to her.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Both of Bernices major love interests, Zane and Piro. Made evident by the fact that each of them vanished from the strip altogether the second Bernice was done with them, as they had no personality or function other than serving as her object of obsession.
</li></ul></li><li> A prime example is The Little Red-Haired Girl from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> comics. We hardly know a thing about her, she didn't appear onstage in the strip (her first on-screen appearance was in an animated TV special in 1977) or even her name (the specials called her "Heather"). Of course, the whole point of this romance is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Charlie Brown's one-sided affections and inner emotional turmoil for her</a>, rather than actual interaction. Which actually makes her essentially the <em>opposite</em> of this trope: her life emphatically does <em>not</em> revolve around Charlie, and she presumably has her own interests, we just don't know anything about them.

</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em> where the three main female characters—Hamilton's wife Eliza, his sister-in-law Angelica, and his mistress Maria—are all defined by their relationship with him and/or other men, due to women being unable to take an active role in American politics in the 1700's. Subverted at the end though, where Eliza recounts her career as founder and headmistress of an orphanage, an endeavor she undertook on her own accord (though still inspired by Hamilton's past as an orphan).

</li><li> Li in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquaria">Aquaria</a></em> due to the fact that we only ever hear Naija talk, and in the past tense. Naija to Li, as well. When she was on her own, her desire just to figure out what the hell happened to everyone made for a pretty compelling motivation; when she meets Li, the story <em>utterly derails</em> as she loses all interest in solving the mystery or exploring; she's so happy that she's not completely alone anymore that as long as she doesn't have to be alone ever again, the game could end right there for all she cares. She literally only continues along to find the answers and beat the final boss because there's a mouse cursor telling her where to go and what to shoot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>, Kyrie has no presence other than being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> for Nero to rescue or providing the odd bit of emotional support.

</li><li> Rosa Joanna Farrell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> is often criticized for her only noticeable character trait being her dedication to Cecil. Ultimately subverted in that she does have reasons to oppose Baron that are unrelated to Cecil. The DS version, in particular, allows the player to view her thoughts on the game's events; they have remarkably little to do with Cecil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> has Sir Fratley for Freya. He's her motivation for leaving Burmecia and travelling the world, and he shows up with amnesia to add even more trauma for her. While Freya helps save the world, Fratley is there entirely as her love interest. He disappears after the second disk, only to reappear in the end. Perhaps in acknowledgment of the trope, Freya's inner monologue expresses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">doubts</a> over whether they can pick up where they left off (as he still does not remember her).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> had one of the main criticisms concerning Lunafreya Nox Fleuret outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">controversy concerning certain production decisions</a> is that Luna's character literally revolves around Noctis and that she has little agency or character outside of helping him achieve his destiny. While this isn't so bad in itself, the problem most have is that she and Noctis have little chemistry and share almost no scenes together when they are both adults <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when both are alive</span>, so the audience doesn't get a good read on what the two would actually be like as a couple.

Even her journal revolves mostly around talking about Ren, complaining about his lax attitude when it comes to keeping things tidy, and further hinting that she's falling more and more in love with him. And her main purpose as a character accompanying Ren is to keep falling under the influence of spirits and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">needing to be rescued</a>.

He can get good development with any of his five love interests (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Female Avatar</a>), and though pairing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Olivia</a> is more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">forced</a> if you chose to do it (she joins <em>the same chapter</em> Chrom has to marry), he <em>can</em> support with her after the fact, and many fans consider said supports to be pretty cute on their own.

</li><li> Out of Chrom's love interests, Sumia is the one who's more frequently accused of being this to him, since she has no prevalence in the story beyond being his love interest, yet she is the only one who receives extra scenes that serve no purpose other than hinting at her to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a>. Even though choosing Chrom's wife is optional, the game's mechanics and her extra scenes (one even titled "lovebirds") does push you to choose Sumia, and she's the only one who receives a cutscene for the proposal, not to mention she has an extremely shallow pool of potential suitors to choose from (Chrom, Frederick, Gaius, Henry, and the Male Avatar). However, she vanishes from the narrative after Lucina joins, instead just becoming just like any of the other units.

Her entire personality and characterization revolve completely around her one-sided crush on Alm; her support with Silque actually sheds light on this by showing she has trouble relating to other non-Alm people and that her obsession with him is considered strange even by her parents. In an interesting subversion, she also cannot end up with Alm under any circumstances since he and Celica are the game's primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>.

Unsurprisingly, they also tend to be the ones least likely picked by players for marriage due to the much more interesting choices the game gives for other bachelorettes. <em>Rune Factory 4</em> manages to subvert this by throwing away the idea of a canon love interest altogether. And before that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier">Rune Factory Frontier</a></em>, due to the expanded characterization for the returning characters, also rescued Mist from this trope as she became known more for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>.

However, this development (such as her interest in computer programming) was more or less dropped when she moved in with him. She then pretty much played this trope to a tee, getting defined only by her relationship with Roast Beef (to the point where she almost never even interacted with the other characters). As of recently, though, she's been getting more development.
</li><li> Alex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Candi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Candi">Candi</a></em>. He seems to be getting more static and more dense with every appearance. Not that he was ever much more than "Candi's boyfriend" before.

While her relationship with Kat is cute, we don't learn anything much about her other than that she used to have a crush on a boy before developing feelings for Kat, she's generally cheerful, and she can talk to animals. After her hook-up with Kat, she's only had one big, plot-relevant scene of talking down a monster that wasn't some variation of "she's happy to be with Kat". Whenever the main characters have to go on some adventure or quest, Paz is conspicuously absent from it and we never even get to see her reactions to Kat and her other schoolmates doing potentially dangerous things or Kat telling her about them. Her main role in the plot so far has been to just occasionally appear to remind us that Kat has a cute girlfriend.

From his first appearance and throughout the comic, all he has ever wanted was Miharu, even while she was engaged to Kazuo (and while he was engaged to Miharu's cousin Karen.) He never gives Miharu (or the audience) a reason why he's in love with her, he just is. The most insight we've gotten into his single-minded desire to completely possess Miharu is that he fell in love with her image in a photograph. Aside from his obsession with her, we don't know much else about him aside from a few throwaway traits. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> All of which completely vanish as in the final ten pages of the comic, he literally makes a phone call to his parents to arrange things so he can safely quit his job, explicitly so he can date Miharu full-time, and then travel the world with her doing...apparently, nothing but eating, given his description of their future activities as "I want to taste food...together."</span>

Ivy O'Neil in the comics can be considered this too. She's told by God and Jesus that her true love is to be Chris himself once he escapes from the mirror, and she accepts this without question or protest. She's pretty much not characterized at all beyond that.

However, it's actually explored and ultimately deconstructed. It's shown that despite having been friends since kindergarten, neither Jackie or Marco actually know a lot about each other personally. In contrast to Star and Marco, who became instant friends after only a few hours. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jackie decides to break up with Marco for this reason, feeling that it's not fair that he became her boyfriend despite Star knowing him better</span>.

The only reason she even appears in the present time of Ooo is to find a cure for her insane fiancé. This gets deconstructed in one episode, where she is shown all of her own ambitions that she simply gave up the day she met Simon, in an effort to try and get her to move on with her life. She ignores this in favor of doubling her efforts instead.

Not only doesn't she receive any character development, but she has no close connections with any of the Rats, nor is she seen with anyone else aside from Tommy. Compared to more popular fan pairings such as Tommy/Kimi and Tommy/Lil, Rachel generally contributes nothing to the series. In addition, their romance has had its share of complications. In the end, because of her family moving away, she generally breaks up with Tommy. But to make matters worse, when Rachel sees Tommy with another girl, she tells him that she never wants to see him again.

Aspects of his character that make him unique—his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMoney">Old Money</a> background or private prep school—don't really get explored outside of some providing light class drama with Daria.

The show had several crushes for the pets who only appeared in one single episode (Delilah was in a two-parter) and they were all developed much deeper. Except for the polecat Captain Cuddles who also didn't have very much characterization aside from being charming. And Philippe Boudreaux who was a Dog Mime, nothing more.

<ul><li> Jeremy Johnson initially had no purpose other than being a bright spot in Candace's life, but later episodes develop him a bit more. He's shown to have his own life and friends, is savvy to Candace's freakouts, and got some interaction with other characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Dr. Doofenshmirtz.</a> In terms of personality, he's pretty much a chill, relaxed, mature, responsible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">Workaholic</a>.

</li><li> Isabella has a huge crush on Phineas and is usually involved in the boys' projects because of this. She's not truly a flat character and has received a decent amount of characterization, but her role and actions in the show largely revolve around her feelings for Phineas.

Literally, the only reason why she continues with her crush is that she doesn't understand Spanish (the grandpa always speaks in Spanish). Then again, in this case, it's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> so that the grandfather can insult her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">laugh maniacally afterwards.</a>
</li><li> AndrAIa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> has this problem, especially after she grows up &amp; loses the naive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> characteristics that made her so endearing at the beginning. She was originally created to do nothing more than try to kill a guy in a submarine, so it's not like she would have needed much of a personality. Also, she's a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, so it's not like she's totally useless.
</li><li> Johnny V. from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> only existed to give Spinelli a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryLoveInterest">Temporary Love Interest</a>, to the point where he appears only in the episode where she likes him.
</li><li> Several minor characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> can come off like this, defined entirely by being the wife of a more prominent character. Sarah Wiggum, Bernice Hibbert, and Brandine Spuckler all come across as this at times, although to some degree they have all developed to a limited extent. Averted with Helen Lovejoy, whose personality of being a gossipy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardian</a> is more than enough to stand on its own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> has Zooey the Fox, Tails' girlfriend. She's a nice girl, and the two do make an adorable couple...but outside of being Tails' girlfriend very little can be said about her.

<ul><li> Wendy Testaburger is mostly defined as Stans on and off girlfriend. While theres a few episodes where she gets more screen-time ("Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset", "Breast Cancer Show Ever" and "The Hobbit") that shows her being more than just Stans girlfriend, her primary role in the show is to be Stans cute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> who can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a>.
</li><li> Heidi Turner has also become this after she was turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> in Season 20 and Season 21. In most episodes of Season 20, her main role was being Cartmans girlfriend. While Season 21 gave her slightly more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, she is still defined as Cartmans girlfriend and after she breaks up with him, she returns to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">old role as a background character</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Lola serves as this role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam">Space Jam</a></em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> and otherwise had very little characterization to herself. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> revamps her into a character that <em>does</em> date Bugs, but has a defined personality, family life, and interests that make her a unique character as well.

</li><li> Squilvia, a one-shot character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, doesn't have much to her outside of being attracted to those who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnragedByIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnragedByIdiocy">Enraged by Idiocy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: There are two characters whose defining trait in the show is to be the person that the two main characters, Star and Marco, have their respective crushes on.
<ul><li> Jackie-Lynn Thomas to Marco. In the first season, Jackie doesn't have much of a role besides being the girl Marco's crushing on. This is even lampshaded by Marco in the season two episode "Sleepover" when he admits he never truly to got know Jackie beyond the image of her he built up, but he would like to try. Jackie is slowly given a more fleshed out personality in her following appearances, as she graduates to becoming Marco's girlfriend, but even with the expanded characterization, her primary role in the show is as Marco's love interest. She promptly disappears from the series as soon as she dumps him but returns in Season 4 where it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she now has a French girlfriend</span>.
</li><li> Oskar Greason only ever gets focus relevant to Star's crush on him. Like Jackie, he does have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>, but is ultimately defined as Star's crush. In fact, Oskar actually goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> at the same time that Star's crush on him fades away and she starts to fall in love with Marco. When he does reappear one last time in the Season 2 finale, his role is as the guy Star <em>used</em> to have a crush on.
</li><li> Averted with Tom, Star's half-demon on-again-off-again boyfriend. Even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">winning back his girlfriend</span>, he received a large amount of characterization and become one of the main characters in the show. Notably, he initially dislikes Marco due to being jealous of his friendship with Star, but over time the two bond, and by the season three finale, Tom confesses to Marco that he now thinks of him as his best friend.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Trent does have characterization but never gets a plotline that doesn't involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Gwen</a>. The writers don't seem to have much else to do with him, at least in the context of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> - he's voted off as soon as they break up in season two and he's not a contestant on season three, though there is a minor subplot about him forming a boy band with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Cody</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy">Harold</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">Justin</a>.
</li><li> Bridgette has the same problem as Trent. She has characterization, but she never really gets any focus from the writers except for her role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurferDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurferDude">Geoff's</a> girlfriend. The one season she participated in without Geoff (season three) still revolved around their relationship when it enters troubled waters due to her falling for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Alejandro's</a> charms and trying to get Geoff to accept her apologies for it.
</li><li> Tyler had no role in season one except being part of the show's first couple with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Lindsay</a>, and his only character trait was that he was terrible at sports. Once he was eliminated, both Lindsay and the writers completely forgot about him, with Lindsay's inability to remember who Tyler is becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>. Season three rectified this by giving him more focus and characterization.
</li><li> Zoey's label and biography describe her as an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster">indie chick</a>", but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">this never comes up in the show itself</a>. Instead, her defining trait is her mutual crush on Mike, who has multiple personalities and is trying to hide this from her.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em>, Devin serves as Carrie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">oblivious</a> target of affection, and the majority of his dialogue is dedicated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage">either fueling or denting her feelings for him</a>. His satellite status is made all the more apparent by his lack of interaction with anyone <em>other</em> than Carrie, as nearly all the other characters (including Carrie herself) had managed to gain at least one friend or rival by the midpoint of the competition.
</li></ul></li><li> Another male example: David of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">good-looking, a book smart genius, an artist, and an athlete</a> — something that appeals to each of the three spies (and sometimes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> too!), making him a universal love interest who exists solely to provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting">romantic B-plots</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> has two examples: <em>Scott's</em> SLI is Taryn Fujioka, whose only connection to the cast besides Scott is the fact she's apparently one of Jean's friends, one that appears once or twice for a few seconds standing next to Jean, then doing nothing until suddenly being interested in Scott. Jean, meanwhile, got Duncan; however, the writers brought him in as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> to give him something besides dating Jean (IE, making him pick on Toad and, to a lesser extent, Blob, and giving him a rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter">Scott</a>), before he developed during seasons 3 and 4 into a mutant hater with a penchant for grudges who's smart enough to avoid antagonizing the mutants that <em>will</em> fight back with their powers.
