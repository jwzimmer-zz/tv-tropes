<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"There's no way to anticipate every danger; you need a backup plan for when things go wrong. That's why home-court advantage is so important."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Michael Westen</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>
</div></div><p>In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SportingEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SportingEvent">Sporting Event</a>, a Home Team or Home Field Advantage refers to the slight edge given to a team playing on their own turf in a match. This exists because of the subtle differences between various sporting venues and the home team already being accustomed to their own court or field or rink, and also because the crowd at a game will usually overwhelmingly support the home team, thus presenting a psychological advantage. While it can give a slight boost to the home team or bring the away team down by a small margin, usually this is not enough to make much of a difference in the game's outcome.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>But, in fiction, something so mundane would be boring or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">require some over the top effects to work like they want</a>. So what do you do? It can be as simple as taking the above mentioned subtle differences and making them such large alterations that it throws the away team off completely. Perhaps the psychological advantage is huge, rather than small. Perhaps the game awards points based on popularity. Perhaps the game and field are complex enough that every field is unique (like golf) and/or deadly (not like golf).
</p><p>You could set <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">the playing field itself</a></em> against them (again, like golf, only it's alive and maybe trying to kill you). All that matters is that whoever is battling on their own turf has a serious advantage that poses a legitimate threat to the other side's winning chances. Often involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effects</a>, taking advantage of the terrain.

If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">bad guys attack the hero in his home</a>, he's bound to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeAloneAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeAloneAntics">a few tricks up his sleeve</a>. Even if he doesn't have anything prepared, who knows his home better than he does? Perhaps you're a local hero and everyone supports you, actively or clandestinely, in your fight against the rampaging killbots. Perhaps you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, and your home is literally part of you. Perhaps you can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomainHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomainHolder">change the local laws of physics</a> to confound attackers.

<ul><li> The main thing about being challenged to a parts war in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear">Air Gear</a></em> is the challenged team know their own territory and can also set traps and use the environment against the opposing team.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FateSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FateSeries">Fate Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Unlimited Blade Works spell (and indeed any and all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld">Reality Marbles</a>) basically invokes this trope, turning the battlefield into one that's perfect for Archer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or Shirou</span> to battle in.
</li><li> In fact, the power of a Servant varies depending of how much it's known and/or revered in their current location. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Lancer of "Black"</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler">Vlad the Impaler</a>) could completely destroy Berserker (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Heracles/Hercules</a>) and Saber (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip">gender-flipped</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, two Servants whose identities are known <em>world-wide</em>, because he was summoned in his home country of Romania, close to his native city to boot, and has a Skill that lets him secure a certain amount of land as his own and boost his power as long as he remains within the bounds of that land (which fittingly enough, is at the headquarters of the Yggdmillennia). This dual-layer homefield advantage is enough he's able to fight toe-to-toe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Lancer of "Red"</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata">Karna</a>) when normally he would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">completely crushed</a> by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Gilgamesh-leveled opponent</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is what ends up happening when he is forced to sacrifice said advantage to fight on the enemy's home turf</span>.
</li><li> Caster Servants have a Skill called Territory Creation, which lets them designate an area as their "Workshop". Inside the Workshop, they are able to gather Mana from the environment (Servants normally need to get Mana from their Masters) and have some control over the surroundings.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has Tenrou Island, the holy land of the eponymous Guild where any mage with the Fairy Tail crest is given a large boost in magic power as long as they're on the island. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Well, it WAS that way anyway...</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, the first of the 4 Sacred Beasts, Genbu, can use his powers over earth to meld with the stone that composes the castle and move freely through it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, the Melone Base is one for Shoichi and his forces because the base itself is his box weapon and he can rearrange it as he chooses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em> has the Saint Cradle, which gives an edge to the combat cyborgs because they aren't affected by the huge magic dampening field all around the ship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Babidi's base can simulate various environments and his henchmen use it to their advantage (although it fails spectacularly when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyWorlder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyWorlder">Heavy Worlder</a> henchman tries increased gravity against Vegeta, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyWorlder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyWorlder">Heavy Worlder</a> himself used to much higher gravity).
</li><li> Magetta, one of the Universe 6 tournament fighters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, has the ability to super heat the battlefield as a side effect of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulking Out</a>. Due to Magetta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan">drinking and being filled with molten lava</a>, this naturally has no effect on him, but tires and overheats his opponent. Unlike the above version with Babidi, this actually <em>does</em> assist him.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Fishmen</a> in general become much stronger and faster while underwater.
</li><li> The fact that the war between the Whitebeard Pirates and the Marines happened at the latter's HQ allowed the Marines to set up several obstacles in order to gain the upper hand through most of the war.
</li><li> Pica of the Donquixote Pirate has the ability to assimilate himself with rock, thus his powers reach max potential while in a naturally rocky island such as Dressrosa, the base of his crew.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, spiritual entities (Soul Reaper, Hollow, Quincy, etc.) are at their most powerful in worlds where reishi (spirit particles) are densest. This means that the spirit worlds of Soul Society and Hueco Mundo are where these beings are at their most powerful.
<ul><li> Furthermore, captain-level Soul Reapers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">willingly limit themselves</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Power Nullifiers</a> which cut their power down 80% before taking on missions on Earth, because with their level of power, they're pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Areas</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Takumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em> has a massive one in the form of Mt Akina. The probable best-known part among non-fans is that Akina has five consecutive hairpin turns, which ordinarily would not allow for recovery. This means Takumi has developed a very rare skill.
</li><li> The various dueling arenas in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> universe often have House Rules that cater to specific strategies. There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effects</a> associated with the "Field Power Bonus" in Duelist Kingdom, where duelists would build decks for specific fields and wait for opponents to come to them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a group of highly trained mercenaries is hired by the world governments to occupy the mountain around Class E in order to ensure that nobody can get to Koro-sensei, who's been trapped in the area around the classroom. However, Class E is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomp</a> the mercenaries once they're given time to prepare. One of the factors contributing to this is the fact that the mercenaries are unfamiliar with the area while Class E has spent the past year training on the mountain to the point where they know the layout like the back of their hand, and setting traps for Koro-sensei that they can now re-purpose against the mercenaries.</span>
</li><li> Purposedly invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger">World Trigger</a></em>. In rank wars, the lowest ranked teams can choose battlefields, including the place, time, and weather, to give them advantage. This privilege is used to great effect by the teams, ranging from reducing snipers' sight, limiting enemies movement, isolating powerful enemies, to pitting enemies against each other.

As a native of Dorne, it doesn't really bother her, while her opponents will quickly become exhausted and thirsty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ImaginarySeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ImaginarySeas">Imaginary Seas</a></em>, Percy gets a massive power boost while in water.

</li><li> One of the consistent themes of all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> films has been that he's the "friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man", and no matter J. Jonah Jameson, the people of New York know Spidey's on their side, and they help him out when times are tough.
<ul><li> In the first Tobey Maguire film, they pelt Green Goblin with bricks and stuff after Spidey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Takes a Third Option</a> on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>.

</li><li> In the Andrew Garfield film, after he's injured fighting the Lizard and needs to get across town as soon as superhumanly possible, construction workers (led by the father of a little boy Spidey saved) line up their cranes to give him a clear path, and a news chopper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis">spotlights it for him</a> so he can't miss it.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ladyhawke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ladyhawke">Ladyhawke</a></em>, the monk character is living in a monastery ruin. When he befriends the Mouse character, he warns him upon crossing the board bridge into his home to walk on the right, but doesn't explain why at the time. Later when the troops of the evil Cardinal arrive they cross the bridge and of course, fall through the weakened or probably sabotaged timbers into the gully below.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FuriousSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FuriousSeven">Furious 7</a></em>, the team invokes this trope by stating that they should face their adversaries on the streets they know best: Los Angeles.

Arthur has spent most of his life on land, and though he was trained in the ways of Atlantean combat by Vulko, he's still a relative novice at fighting underwater. Orm on the other hand has spent his whole life underwater and has been trained since childhood to be a master of fighting underwater. Arthur is able to hold his own for a bit, but it becomes painfully clear that he has no chance of winning. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mera's intervention is the only thing that saves Arthur's life.</span> In their rematch, Mera advises Arthur to take the fight to his home turf, so Arthur forces them to the surface.

However, the cartel soldiers wise up and start using their superior numbers (and ability to reinforce) to their advantage against the cut-off soldiers, and turn the tide.

Before this, Quidditch teams would cheat on their home fields by making their own goalposts too small, while the opposing goals were too large.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles">Iron Druid Chronicles</a></em> druids are wise about this. Atticus has some very powerful enemies looking for him so he spent at least a century setting up his defenses. He befriended all the local nature spirits, allied himself with the local vampire lord and the local werewolf pack and put multiple layers of magical and mundane protections on his home and workplace. His ultimate home field advantage comes from an arrangement he has with Morrigan, one of his pantheon's Death Gods. As long as any battle he is in takes place under the jurisdiction of that god, Atticus cannot die in it. Unfortunately his enemy goes to extraordinary lengths to nullify all those advantages including making sure that the final battle happens where Morrigan has no jurisdiction and cannot interfere.

It also makes mortal wizards leave a chunk of their power at the door. The more "lived in" the home, the larger the home field advantage. However, keeping a business in the house, where people are constantly invited in, degrades the power. For this reason, while Harry's threshold was weak, he didn't keep his business there for fear of destroying what he had all together. Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some supernaturals, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, can bypass the threshold so long as they abide by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> and not cause the house to be worse off than when they arrived</span>.

However, they're also experienced with using personnel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">shields</a>, which require a specific form of blade fighting. Since using shields on Arrakis is suicide (they attract the worms and drive them crazy), the Sardaukar end up being slaughtered by the Fremen, although not without inflicting casualties of their own (usually at 3-to-1 ratios). Subverted in the sequels, where it's mentioned that the Fremen have somehow managed to conquer most of the known worlds despite wildly different climates.

</li><li> In military thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, the rebels make skillful use of this in the military sense in their struggles with federal law enforcement agents and military forces, taking full advantage of such factors as knowledge of terrain, sympathetic locals and overextended enemy logistics.

<ul><li> The advantage in sports isn't all psychological. Sometimes it's an advantage from familiarity with the field itself, or the training conditions it provides.
<ul><li> Even a cursory glance at the standings page of any in-season sport quickly reveals just how massive the difference is between records of teams at home (it's not unusual for playoff-caliber NFL teams to run the table at home during the regular season, and the 1986 Boston Celtics hold the NBA record with a record of 40 wins and only one loss at home while going 27-14 on the road.) Rare indeed is the team that is better away.
</li><li> A possibly apocryphal story holds that Green Bay has never lost at home below a certain temperature, and that the Dolphins have never lost at home <em>above</em> a certain temperature.
</li><li> Sometimes it can also be a home weather advantage: The Patriots usually win when it's snowing, especially against teams from warm climates or those whose home field is indoors.
</li><li> Golf is proverbially not against the other players, but against the course. Ergo, if one player knows the course better, he has an advantage.
</li><li> Training in the mountains has its advantages. The air is rarefied, so it's harder to breath. Your body produces more blood cells as a result. Thus, when you go down to sea level you're like a Charles Atlas Breather, which can cause problems if your blood becomes too thick, but otherwise you're just better adapted for endurance sports. The inverse is true as well, if you're accustomed to sea level, merely being at a high altitude can be difficult, rarely fatal, and high altitude teams have a <em>definite</em> advantage at home. It's the reason (along with the beautiful weather) why many Olympic swimmers have been known to spend their summers training in sleepy little Flagstaff, Arizona, some seven to eight thousand feet above sea level depending on where in town you are.
</li><li> In international sporting events, climates can vary wildly even in the same country. A team unused to say, the sweltering heat and high humidity of the tropics coupled with the constant rains of a monsoon season, would have a distinct disadvantage.
</li><li> In American college basketball, Vanderbilt is claimed to enjoy a unique home court edge because of the unusual configuration of its court. The Commodores' current home of Memorial Gymnasium, which opened in 1952, was designed with the team benches at the ends of the court, instead of along the sidelines. At that time, this setup was not uncommon, but Memorial is now the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA">NCAA</a> Division I arena whose benches aren't along the sidelines. The edge for Vanderbilt is that opposing coaches aren't accustomed to directing their teams from the basket area, especially when the team is at the other end of the court.
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of American Collegiate Basketball, Home Court Advantage is <em>officially</em> recognized in the NCAA's Evaluation Tool (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">officially known as the "NET"</a>) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-08-22/net-rankings-what-know-about-college-basketballs-new-tool">debuting in the 2018-19 Season<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: An individual result's weight in the rankings gets a +0.4 bonus if it's a Road game for the team in question, and a -0.4 penalty if it's a Home game. The distilled "quadrant system" also had the quadrant boundaries shifted based on whether a game was played at home, at a neutral site, or on the road.
</li><li> Baseball. At higher levels of play, home teams try to gain an advantage over visitors by altering the field conditions. For example, if the opposing team has fast base runners the home team will heavily water the infield to slow them down. <br/><br/>Additionally, outfield fences are not uniform in either their shape or distance from home plate - they only need to be some minimum distance (and even then Boston's Fenway Park, which would otherwise be in violation of these regulations, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">grandfathered in</a> due to the park's age). This lets teams tailor their rosters to take advantage of these quirks - Yankee Stadium, for example, has traditionally had a pretty short right field, so lefty power hitters often hit a lot of homers in that direction. Supposedly, this was intentional - Babe Ruth, a lefty and probably the first player to be known for his big bat, was already a Yankee when the first Yankee Stadium was built in 1923. Incidentally, the Yankees often have a high proportion of power hitters that can hit lefty (either naturally or as a switch-hitter) on their roster.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a> team Hereford United have a pitch which is actually on a slope. The slope is slight and almost un-noticeable - but it is still a slope. Visiting teams unaware of this are frequently disorientated by the behaviour of the ball as they kick it—it will travel faster and further downhill and slower and shorter uphill. This has allowed Hereford to collect the scalps of many fine teams, including Manchester United and Liverpool.
<ul><li> Football Association rules also dictate the maximum possible length and width of a football field, but allow for variations of plus or minus twenty yards. The lower division side Shrewsbury Town have the longest football pitch in England—it was even larger than the old Wembley Stadium—and its sheer size both disorientates and tires visiting teams.
</li><li> It's also possible to "customize" a pitch in order to favour a club's general playstyle. Spain's Barcelona FC, for example, tends to water the grass of the Camp Nou before matches in order to make the ball travel faster on the ground, allowing for faster passing.
</li><li> In South America, teams situated on the Andes, be it national squads or clubs, are usually feared because the altitude <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness">hinders team performances<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The situation is inverted on away games, as the Andean teams show their technical deficiencies at sea level.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> usually helps the hosts, at least for the men. Out of the eight world champions, only Brazil and Spain never won a title at home (including France and England's only Cups). Other standout performances: Sweden's only final, Chile and South Korea's only semifinals, Mexico's only quarterfinals (twice), and Switzerland's last quarterfinal (and only in the group-and-knockouts format). While South Africa in 2010 is the biggest subversion in that for the first time the host fell in the group stage, they also managed to get a victory against France.
<ul><li> This was brutally subverted in 2014, where Brazil was going strong through the tournament and didn't lose any matches, scoring 10 goals and conceding only 4... until the semifinals, where they were <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">slaughtered</a> 1-7</strong> (0-5 in the first half <em>alone</em>) by Germany, which was promptly followed by a 0-3 loss against the Netherlands.
</li><li> However, in the women's version, only the USA has ever advanced to the semifinals or beyond at home (won in 1999, third in 2003). Every other host has lost in the quarterfinals.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of stadiums are noted for their particularly intimidating atmospheres, in which the fans become 'the twelfth man'. Particularly notable examples are:
<ul><li> Stamford Bridge, home stadium of Chelsea FC, where they sustained an 86 game unbeaten run from 2005 to 2008, and another 77 game unbeaten run a few years later.
</li><li> Anfield, home stadium of Liverpool FC, respectably sized at 54,000 seats after a recent expansion, has been a little less consistent about this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">thanks to the team's own inconsistencies</a>, but on better runs has been referred to as 'Fortress Anfield' - a nickname that became so ubiquitous, a major fansite was named after it. And at times, it has most definitely been justified: throughout the 1970's, Liverpool only lost 11 home games <em>in total.</em> This included the beginning of an 85 game unbeaten run from 1978 to 1981 which was only eclipsed by Chelsea 25 years later. While it hasn't reached that level since, the current Liverpool side went the entire 2017-2018 season unbeaten at home. It's most famous for its iconic home stand, the Kop, which is usually the noisiest part of the ground and gives its name to Liverpool fans, who are usually referred to as 'Kopites'. The power of the Kop was perhaps most aptly summed up in 2018 by Thomas Tuchel, whose star-studded PSG team had just lost 3-2, a scoreline that was much closer than the match itself. Tuchel, who'd also lost two years before when his similarly star-studded Borussia Dortmund came up against Liverpool, who recovered from 2-0 and 3-1 down to win 4-3, simply said after the defeat: "This is Anfield. This is what they do."
</li><li> Also of note is the fact that local rivals Everton haven't won at Anfield in 17 years (even in years that they finished above Liverpool in the league) and English football's new superpower Manchester City have only won once at Anfield in the Premier League era, back in 2003, and not once since they were taken over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh">Sheikh Mansour</a> in 2008, having been thrashed in almost every visit since.
</li><li> Old Trafford, home stadium of Manchester United (arch-rivals of the above mentioned Liverpool), dubbed 'the Theatre of Dreams' by club legend Sir Bobby Charlton, was the basis for two decades of dominance of the English game. It helps that with a capacity of over 75,000, it's the largest club stadium in Britain, second largest stadium as a whole in Britain and ninth largest in Europe. The phenomenon of "Fergie time" has often been remarked upon; there was a distinct tendency for even the <em>referee</em> to be intimidated both by the size of Old Trafford, its vocal home support, and the tendency of United's players to be vocally and intimidatingly dissenting of decisions that went against them. Something their manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned a seriously blind eye to. Referees were also horribly aware that a bad match report from a manager of the biggest and most financially powerful team in the Premiership could well be held against them in their own performance reviews. Too many negative reports from team managers, and a referee risked losing his status as an official in the top flight. Quite often injury time might stretch out for an unfeasibly long, long, time past the official ninety minutes, and it was remarked upon how quickly the games then ended after United scored an equaliser or a winning goal at home. Not that the ref was ever being intimidated by the ground, the team, or by Fergie the manager, of course!
</li><li> In 2015/16, Leicester's King Power stadium developed a reputation as a near impossible place to win, the team losing only once (2-5 to Arsenal in September), as they won their impossible title.
</li><li> Outside of England, there's Barcelona's Camp Nou, seating <em>99,000</em> spectators, Real Madrid's Bernabeu, which seats 81,000 and Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park (better known as the Westfalenstadion), which also holds 81,000, including the legendary 'Yellow Wall' home stand. All three have a reputation for being indomitable and absolutely terrifying places for opposing teams to go.
</li><li> In the Netherlands, <em>De Kuip</em>, the home stadium of Feyenoord Rotterdam has this reputation. Feyenoord's fanbase, nicknamed <em>Het Legioen</em> (The Legion), is considered the most fanatic in the Netherlands. Just as with Liverpool, it is not impossible to snatch a victory for opposing teams thanks to the disappointing results of Feyenoord. However, the atmosphere is that intimidating that even <em>home players</em> crumble under the pressure of playing there, making it a disadvantage. Moreover, the Dutch Football Association admitted that when young referees are being groomed to become full members of the referee squad the atmosphere in De Kuip is taking into consideration. First, referees are only allowed to lead matches on lower levels in small stadiums. Then they progress to bigger stadiums for higher ranked teams. Leading a match in Rotterdam is considered the final step.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage">tells us<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that this is considered so important that important games like playoffs or elimination matches are either held at a neutral site, or with multiple games played on both teams' home courts. It also provides numerous examples of the strength of the advantage.
</li><li> Camp Nou has nothing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">US college football</a>. Barça, we'll see your 99,000... and raise you by <em>eight</em>. That's the number of college stadiums that hold <em>over 100,000</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pxwf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0pxwf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pxwf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">From largest to smallest, by school: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UniversityOfMichigan">Michigan</a>, Penn State, Texas A&amp;M, Tennessee, LSU, Ohio State, Alabama, Texas</span> All have reputations as difficult for visitors. And atmospheres that are equally intimidating, or even more so, can be found even in noticeably smaller college venues.
</li><li> In international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">cricket</a>, the pitches are often prepared in such a way as to suit the home team's playing style. For example, pitches in India and Sri Lanka are usually suited to spin bowling, while those in the West Indies are suited to fast bowling.
<ul><li> The pitch at Lord's has a slope (some six feet in height difference across the whole width of the ground). If a bowler is used to it (i.e. plays for Middlesex), it can be used to create deliveries that just can't be bowled anywhere else. If a batsman is used to it, it can create some incredible scoring opportunities playing ground running shots down the slope for four runs.
</li></ul></li><li> Some old news articles mention sports teams win because of a "home hemisphere advantage".
</li><li> Sometimes a sport can have a time-zone <em>disadvantage</em>. One factor in why the Los Angeles Kings fairly easily handled the New Jersey Devils in the 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup">Stanley Cup</a> playoffs was theorized to be the fact that the NHL's Western Conference (which the Kings play in) had cities in four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern), while the Eastern Conference only had a single city (Winnipeg) outside the Eastern Time Zone. The Kings were therefore used to playing at very different times when on the road compared to the Devils. Following the 2013 NHL realignment, the Eastern Conference now contains only the sixteen teams in the Eastern Time Zone, while the Western Conference contains the fourteen teams in the other three time zones.
</li><li> NHL hockey even builds in a procedural advantage for the home team with the "Last Change" rule. After a stoppage in play, the visiting team is required to be the first to make any desired changes to the players it has on the ice. The home team then makes its changes <em>after</em> the visitors have done so—effectively giving the home coach the chance to create the matchups he wants on the ice at the restart. This often includes choosing a center likely to win the faceoff over the opposing center, or using strong defensive players to shut down the opposition's top scorers.
</li><li> In Australia, teams based in the eastern states can be at a significant disadvantage when playing against teams based in Perth, which is two hours behind (or three if it's during daylight saving and they're not from Queensland). The only other major city in a different time zone to the east coast is Adelaide, which is only half an hour behind.
<ul><li> Some Australian sports competitions also feature a team from New Zealand, which is two hours ahead of the Australian east coast (three hours ahead of Queensland during daylight savings). This puts all Australian teams at a disadvantage. Perth teams have a significantly larger disadvantage as the four- or five-hour time difference is enough to cause jet lag.
</li><li> In the National Basketball League, the "Doomsday Double" is when an eastern states team plays a double-header against the Adelaide 36ers and Perth Wildcats. It is exceedingly rare for a team to win both games.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations">The Commonwealth of Nations</a>' own version of the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, has seventeen sports: ten compulsory sports<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1umo4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1umo4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1umo4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">athletics (track and field), badminton, boxing, hockey (field hockey), lawn bowls, netball, rugby sevens, squash, swimming, weightlifting</span> and seven optional sports which the host nation chooses. Cue host nations picking optional sports they know they can win gold medals in.
</li><li> The book <em>Scorecasting</em> uses a large volume of statistics to argue that virtually all of home-field advantage in sports in due to the effects of the crowds on the subconscious perceptions of the game officials. The book notes that, for example, the statistical "strike zone" formed by charting the path of each pitch, and whether it was a called ball or strike, is consistently slightly larger for home teams. It also notes that certain things which are completely objective and officials don't have a subjective determination to make (whether a unblocked field goal attempt is made or missed in American football, whether a free throw is missed or not in basketball, etc) happen at the same percentage for home and road teams.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>: At Kardinia Park in Geelong, the opposition coach's box faces west, resulting in the sun being in his eyes late in the afternoon on sunny days.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">Rugby Union</a>, New Zealand are the dominating national team with a winning record against every team they've played, regardless of where the match is held. However, this trope is played bizarrely straight in Rugby World Cups, where every time they faced a solo host nation (in 1995, 2003 and 2007), they have lost. New Zealand themselves also play this straight, having won both World Cups which they have hosted or co-hosted.
</li><li> Averting this trope is precisely why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> is held in a neutral location outside the competing teams' hometowns, or even home <em>states</em>.

<ul><li> Militaries deliberately take advantage of terrain wherever they are. Nations' borders have historically been drawn by geography determining where it would be too difficult for one side or the other to cross into, take, and hold enemy territory. Usually at rivers and mountains. In campaigns, the home field advantage is based on the fact that the aggressor has to move into hostile territory and then either find supplies (often destroyed by the defender) or bring them in over the long distance from home through said hostile territory, where they could easily be destroyed by the defender.
<ul><li> One main military strategy that's always been extremely popular is the strategically offensive/tactically defensive campaign: force the enemy on to a battlefield of your choosing and then force them to be the ones making the (costly) initial attack.
</li><li> Subverted with the Battle of Hastings. The English were on their home turf facing off against the invading Norman mercenaries <em>and</em> possessed the superior position at the top of Senlac Hill. Not only that, but William's offensive tactics (archer screen softens the English infantry, then his own infantry engages, then his cavalry breaks through and routs them) weren't as effective as he'd hoped, due in part to the English shield wall blunting his archers' effectiveness and the English ranks maintaining strength and cohesion. The Norman charge was thus ineffective and became mired in fighting when the English withstood it (and taking heavy casualties on the way up the hill), forcing him to commit his cavalry sooner than anticipated, which splashed off the English shield wall with minimal impact. The Norman left flank broke and fled, forcing the rest of the Normans into retreat. The English army then began to pursue, only for the Normans to regroup and slaughter most of the knights. With the loss of English cohesion and the successful regroup, the Normans managed to turn the tide and win the day. The English had every advantage and if they hadn't abandoned their superior position to chase the fleeing Normans, they would have won. Never bring foot-soldiers to a horse-race.
</li><li> Home field advantage is why a resistance/insurgency is so dangerous: the occupying force is in a foreign land, generally far from logistical support, and depending on the nature of the occupancy, possibly among hostile locals. The insurgents/resistance fighters, on the other hand, have familiarity of terrain, diverse logistics, and depending on the popularity of the uprising, an entire population of help.
</li></ul></li><li> Historians generally agree that the American Revolution was Britain's Vietnam (though they may never use those words). They won most conventional battles, but they had no real hope of winning the war. America was on the other side of the world, meaning they couldn't respond quickly or meaningfully to events on the ground, and every victory cost them hearts and minds. Hell, the mere presence of "foreign" troops in the colonies was one of the first causes of the conflict! (See also: virtually every conflict in which an underdog has held off a vastly superior invading army.) It also didn't help that Britain wasn't using her best troops (which were stationed elsewhere in the Empire).
</li><li> There are home field disadvantages. If one's own army is invading then the other side's peasants will be the victims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder">Plunder</a> whereas your own will be safe to provide revenue. Furthermore one's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState">Puppet States</a> will have no support if they choose to defect whereas the enemy ruler while being invaded will have to deal with this. These were many times in the past a strong consideration before the days of nationalism made the general population identify enough with their government to have a high probability of taking sides with the home team instead of just getting out of the way.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Hoplite</a> battles there was a considerable home field advantage simply because a Greek soldier's gear was heavy. Also, for a long time most cities were defended only by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard">militia</a> who had to get back to their crops and had a limited interest in politics to say the least.
</li><li> Modern military bases can try to be very subtle about this. One of the more advanced tricks of modern security is to arrange the geography of the base so that intruders (not necessarily invading armies, but even individual thieves) are encouraged to take certain paths, thus making them easier to spot by security personnel. This involves building hills, placing trees, etc. and taking advantage of known human proclivities.
</li><li> Happened thrice in Russia, during Sweden's invasion, Napoleon's invasion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The Russians choose to dig in, hoping to grind their opponents in a slow war of attrition. The invaders were forced to keep moving with their supply lines stretched thin and had to survive the Russian winter, which slowed them down and killed some of their forces, while the Russians were able to regroup and rearm themselves for a counterattack. They also employed guerrilla and scorched earth tactics (e.g. burning Moscow to the ground to keep it out of Napoleon's hands). The only time this didn't work is when the Mongols invaded Russia when it was still a collection of squabbling princedoms.

If the enemy manages to make it there, your ally will not have to travel far to complete the kill.
