And middle school graduation parties.
</li><li> Kyo's foster father, though he initially took him in to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">atone for his treatment of the previous Cat</span>, did a remarkable job raising him — probably the best thing he did was treat him with respect. (For instance, when Kyo was young, and they encountered some Sohma women gossiping about how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyo as good as killed his mother</span>, he picked Kyo up and said "It's time you breathed the air of higher places", shaming the women into silence.) Though a teacher once questioned his parenting because of Kyo's problem behavior, Kyo probably turned out as well as he could have, given the circumstances. Having a parent he could trust and turn to was likely what kept him from giving over to despair entirely.

Mrs. Minami is fine with her daughter's and said daughter's friends' school idol careers so long as they study and pass their exams, which is a reasonable enough condition. In the last few episodes of season 1, Kotori gets an offer to study abroad at a prestigious fashion school; rather than force a decision, Mrs. Minami allows Kotori time to think about whether to pursue the opportunity and the very promising future that's implied with it, or stay in Japan to build a career as an idol instead. Ultimately, Kotori decides <em>at the last minute</em> to ditch her flight to the school in question and rejoin μ's, right in time for a concert no less; her mother can be seen in the crowd, simply smiling as she watches and glad that Kotori is happy with her choice.

</li><li> Admiral Lindy Harlaown is another case of a good single parent, but in her case, the TSAB is more accomodating of single parent employees. Raising a son like Chrono who had become withdrawn due to the death of his father is no easy task, and she later she adopts Fate, a little girl who had been raised in an abusive household. Thanks to her efforts, both have gone out from their own shells, growing up to become successful adults and parents themselves. Even then, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">sound stages</a> reveal that she's still there to help while she's semi-retired, either in taking care of their kids while they're away or in giving them parental advice for the problems they encounter.

In fact, the second <em>StrikerS</em> Sound Stage revealed that Fate put a lot of effort into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoking this</a> to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather">ending up like Precia</a>.

</li><li> Genya and Quint Nakajima are shown to be this towards their daughters Ginga and Subaru, with Genya raising his daughters on his own after Quint died in a mission when they were still young. When Genya feared for the life of his daughter Subaru <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Ginga had just been kidnapped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>, and was ready to use his military clout to remove Subaru from Riot Force 6 after she was injured, he nonetheless respected the wishes of Subaru when she decided that she wanted to stay to help finish the incident. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's later revealed that Ginga and Subaru were children that were illegally cloned from Quint without her knowledge, which she had decided to adopt regardless because they needed someone to take care of them.

When Nanoha learned what she is, she and Fate adopted Vivio and raised her as a normal child, giving Vivio enough support and leeway so she could pursue her own goals but doing it with enough strictness so Vivio doesn't abuse her powers for mischief. And may heaven help anyone who decides that it would be a good idea to kidnap Vivio.

<ul><li> After Marty influences the past events of his parents in 1955 and returns to his own time, George and Lorraine are seen as this, due to George having confidence in himself and Lorraine having a much more positive outlook on life.

She loves her children and does her best to help them get through school (including doing their homework). She is also a working mom, which results in her constantly being late for everything. Her husband is lazy and is revealed to be cheating on her with a dairy farmer over Skype. Eventually, the stress gets to her, and she snaps, forcing her kids to fend for themselves, blowing off her job, and starting to party with two other moms (one of whom also fits this trope, while the other one is an oversexed single mom, who constantly ignores her son). This puts her in conflict with Gwendolyn, the head of the PTA at her kids' school, who lords over all the moms with tyrannical efficiency. Eventually, Amy manages to convince all the moms at the school to start taking it easier to avoid this much stress. Also, her new hands-off approach with her kids bears fruit. Her son becomes a pretty good cook, and her daughter is far less stressed out over her chances of going to college (and she's only 12). She also hooks up with a widower, who also fits this trope (and finds the time to get rock-hard abs).

Despite having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>, Scott's mother clearly loves him and works long hours at the hospital to provide for him; Stiles' father accepts his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> son for who he is and often shows pride or affection towards him; and Allison's parents both care for her a great deal. Even Lydia's divorced mother and Jackson's adoptive parents appear to genuinely want the best for their children. The Argents do however lose points on a number of fronts, most notably in the case of Victoria, as Allison would have probably preferred a live werewolf mother to a dead one and of course Gerard, who ordered his daughter-in-law's death, and later revealed his willingness to kill his son and granddaughter as well.

Kitty's emotional support has proven essential to allowing Eric to survive being Red's son, and has also led her to provide support for Eric's friends. Red might seem harsh and strict, but dealing with it leads Eric to become a stronger person for it, especially since Red only really punishes Eric when he's actually done something to deserve it. The one time Eric didn't deserve to be punished (when he took the blame for Donna smoking cigarettes) he apologized for not believing him and making him smoke an entire carton. They aren't just this to Eric, but they are also like this to his friends, acting as surrogate parents, especially to Hyde. They're probably the best parents out of anyone in the series.

Despite loving her deeply, Asura had no idea how to raise children and admitted that the best he could do is punch anyone who made her cry. As Durga herself puts it, she would raise Mithra while Asura made the world a safer place for her. Sometime during Mithra's childhood, Asura took a more active role as a parent, best shown when he plays along with Mithra's shenanigans but also shown in his refusal to let Mithra become her generation's Priestess (essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a>) and an instrument of war.

Gorion loved them dearly no matter what alignment they choose, and encouraged them to follow their own path. He also took them to the safety of Candlekeep even though he apparently lost face for it, and in spite of many believing you would bring ruin to them all. By contrast, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">biological parents</a> were an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">evil god</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">who wanted you to die</a> so he could come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, and a cultist who bore her deity's child willingly and was ready to kill you because her master told her to.
<ul><li> In fact, parentage is discussed in the game, with this being one of the facets. The player meets several evil Bhaalspawn who try to have them killed or do the job themselves, but of those whose pasts are known, none of them were lucky enough to have a parent like Gorion. Sarevok in particular got the short end of the stick: his kindly foster mother was strangled to death in front of him as a child, his foster father was a horrible, horrible person and his mentor was deliberately guiding him down the path of darkness for his own personal glory. He and the player were in the same place when Gorion found them, and when he believed he could only save one of them, he chose the player, leaving Sarevok to fend for himself. And even though Yaga-Shura's adoptive mother loved him, she too was grooming him to take his father's place. Bhaal hated them all as well. A key way to get the best ending possible is to acknowledge that any of them could have become heroic rather than villainous if received the boons the player and their little sister Imoen enjoyed in life.

Linda can be embarrassing and a little crazy and Bob has trouble connecting to people emotionally, but they both love and support their kids in their endeavors, and are quick to remind them of how much they care. Bob especially does not belittle or invalidate his children's unorthodox interests as you'd expect a sitcom father to do, even if he thinks something is conceptually stupid, like cheer-leading, and usually only objects if he feels it will pose a threat to them (like when Tina decided to read her erotic friend-fiction out loud at school). They also take genuine pride in how intelligent, creative, and strong-willed their kids are, and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">stand up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">for them</a> if anyone dares to insult or cause problems for them. In Bob's case, his parenting style seems partially born out of a determination to be a better father than his dad, who was stubborn, overly-controlling, and made Bob spend his childhood outside of school working at the diner instead of playing like the other kids. In one episode Bob even fires the kids so they won't waste their childhood working like he was made to. In addition, Linda's crazy side does actually help when trying to keep her very willful, defiant children (read: Louise) in check, and despite Bob and Linda's imperfections, they still raised kids who are far-and-away more intelligent and generally competent than most of the other kids in their school (and a fair number of the adults).

</li></ul></li><li> The Gordys, Dutch's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity">Motorcity</a></em>, are this to him and his brother Dar, despite the fact that they're separated from him. They're also one of the few examples of this trope, as most characters' parents are absent for unexplained reasons, save Julie's father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Abraham Kane</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyDadTheRockStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyDadTheRockStar">My Dad the Rock Star</a></em>: Rock Zilla (the eponymous rock star) and his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">Crystal</a>. As wacky as they are, both of them are clearly extremely supportive and loving parents to their kids Willy and Serenity and always mean well with their actions - something that Willy, despite usually finding it kinda embarrassing to be related to them, understands very well about them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Twilight Sparkle's parents, Twilight Velvet and Night Light. They feed their daughter's love of learning, help her apply to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns and are there to encourage her during her entrance exam. Both show up and appear very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou">proud</a> of their children when attending Shining Armor's wedding and their daughter's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">coronation</span>. Twilight Velvet, in particular, is shown crying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy">Tears of Joy</a> at both occasions.
</li><li> Shining Armor and Princess Cadence are both very loving parents to their daughter Flurry Heart, despite being worn out taking care of her and keeping her alicorn powers in check. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E3AFlurryOfEmotions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E3AFlurryOfEmotions">A Flurry of Emotions</a>" they broke down in tears because of Spearhead's art reminding them of her; they couldn't stand being apart from her for so long.
</li></ul></li><li> About a metric ton of shows from Canada's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a> studio have this. Let's see:
<ul><li> Eddie Storkowitz' parents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdz">Birdz</a></em>. The mother is rather laid-back and supportive, while the father is somewhat stricter but never comes off as mean. Most episodes show Eddie generally getting along with his parents.
</li><li> All of the parents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin">Franklin</a></em> seem to be this, though it's perhaps most easily noticeable with Franklin and Harriet's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, since they show up far more often than any of the other parents. It's very unusual for them to even raise their voices, yet they seem to have raised very nice kids on the whole in Franklin and Harriet. Mr. Turtle does very occasionally slip into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> characteristics, but otherwise has a good, level head and is also quite handy around the house (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfPlumbingProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfPlumbingProject">except when it comes to plumbing, anyway</a>). And Franklin likes that Mrs. Turtle always reads him two stories before bed, even when she's tired.
</li><li> Mother and Father Bear from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleBear">Little Bear</a></em> are some of the best parents in all of western animation.
</li><li> All the parents featured in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells">Rosemary Wells</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool">Timothy Goes to School</a></em> series. Especially Timothy's parents, Yoko's mother, The Frank's father and Juanita's mother and father. Helps that Timothy's mother is voiced by Little Bear's mother.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em>: K.O. is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a>, and with a "mommy" like Carol, it's easy to see why; she's loving, affectionate, and supportive to her son, and gives him excellent guidance and encouragement in his efforts to become a great hero.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>:
<ul><li> Linda and Lawrence are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> couple raising the children from their respective first marriages together, and while mostly oblivious to their exploits take care of them very well.
</li><li> From the same series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Doofenshmirtz</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter">his daughter</a> Vanessa, who begins to realize over the course of the series that he's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wRSFBWOxrc">not so bad a father<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> despite his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">doting</a>. Averted, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">by Doofenshmirtz's own parents</a>, who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">basically horrible</a>. In fact, it could be interpreted that his own horrible upbringing is the reason he so desperately wants to be a good father.
</li><li> In the TV film, it was shown that Doofenshmirtz's alternate self (who is far more competent and evil) is very overprotective towards the alternate Vanessa in a deleted scene and is very disappointed in her lack of interest of doing evil, though he remains civil with her. Eventually, in the episode sequel, it is revealed that the alternate Doof is still married to his wife (the alternate Charlene), as they faked their divorce to ensure their family's safety and finances; even the alternate Doof entrusts the alternate Charlene to have full custody of their Vanessa in case he would be overthrown and imprisoned. This paid off well as the alternative Vanessa formulates an escape plan for her family in case they would be arrested for their crimes.
</li></ul></li><li> Carrot and Celery Propulsion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em>. They are some of the best depictions of parents in western animation. They may be a bit loony at times, but they're by no means stupid, as they are very knowledgeable on space, and even have a job as intergalactic travel writers. They are also kind and friendly to everyone, and take good care of their son, Jet.
</li><li> Sid's parents on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SidTheScienceKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SidTheScienceKid">Sid the Science Kid</a></em> not only support Sid's curious nature they also humor all his questions. Plus they encourage him to explore his questions in more detail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ned and Maude Flanders, fundamentalist tendencies aside. In the episode where the Simpsons children were taken in by them after Child Services took them from Marge and Homer, Maggie showed more affection to Ned than she ever did to Homer. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">movie</a> Bart outright wishes for Ned to have been his father after Homer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behavior reaches a peak.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Chief</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Wiggum</a> to his son Ralph. He is very supportive of him, and often uses his authority to help him.
</li><li> Marge is a very loving and caring mother who has a close bond with all her children. She has her issues and sometimes argues with Bart or Lisa, but her intentions are good, and is always willing to support her children and give them advice.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the adults being completely useless and borderline insane, Wendy's parents and Token's parents of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> qualify. As far as the main four's parents go, Sharon Marsh is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">only normal one</a>.
</li><li> Norman Osborn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> qualifies, contrasting to his comic counterpart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Greg Universe is this to Steven, or at least tries his hardest. Despite being homeless (he lives out of his van<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lbi7');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lbi7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lbi7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is because most of the money he makes finances the Temple house so that Steven has a home.</span>) and extremely apprehensive about his son going on magical adventures with the Gems (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">though ends up supporting him nonetheless</a>), he is supportive of his son and will do anything in his power to help and encourage him. He encourages Steven's musicality, understands Steven's emotional sensitivity, and doesn't fault him for either like one would expect a TV father to do. He also tries to appear responsible to Connie's parents so that they'll continue to allow Connie and Steven's friendship.
<ul><li> In addition to Greg, you also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Garnet</a> of the Crystal Gems. While not biologically Steven's mother, she is one of the three who take care of him at a regular basis. And while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Amethyst</a> is a tad bit immature and vindictive, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Pearl</a> coddles Steven and seems to hold resentment for Rose's disappearance, Garnet has been nothing but kindhearted, open-minded and supportive of the boy. She lets him make mistakes, learn from them, and better himself as a person without being too clingy to him; also, her interactions with Steven provide some of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/StevenUniverse">sweetest moments</a> in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Hugh and Jean (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Taz</a>'s parents) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania">Taz-Mania</a></em> are such loving parents to their 3 children. Several people would have abandoned Taz, but these two? They are <em>very</em> tolerant of their son's crazy antics and stick by him, no matter what.
</li><li> Dwayne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>, he always looks out for Junior's best interest, always volunteering to take on the more dangerous challenges in his place.
</li><li> Most of the parents shown on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em>, Tino's especially, but Tish's as well. Lor's, not so much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">depending on one's experience with the character</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> and is stern yet fair with the team and willing to praise them if they do a good job. When Robin was jealous that Batman was privately lecturing Aqualad and Batman realized, he didn't reprimand Robin or ignore him but rather, invite him out for a basketball game to assure Robin that no one will be replacing him.
</li><li> He particularly stands out next to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, who, understandably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatThingIsNotMyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatThingIsNotMyChild">is having some trouble</a> adjusting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a>. In time, however, he does come to accept Superboy as his brother, even bestowing upon him a Kryptonian name: Kon-El.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Wally's</a> parents support his superhero career and take its inherent strangeness in stride, providing the most "normal" version of this trope. There's also Artemis' mother, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gave up a life of crime</span> to give her a better life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Red Arrow</a> officially becomes one in the third season after he retires from the superhero business and starts going by "Will Harper," having settled into the role of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband">House Husband</a> and establishing a very successful private security company. One of the things he prioritizes is getting home in time to have dinner with his daughter Lian. Lian's mother Jade, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> despite leaving her and Will to go back to being Cheshire</span>, is shown to love Lian very much and is an extremely far cry from her sociopathic counterpart in the comics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though it's implied [[spoiler: Jade did not go back to her masked persona of her own free will and is hiding the reason why from Will and her sister Artemis.</span>
