Decides to sacrifice a comrade to complete a task, and raises an orphan boy with ulterior motives. However, he loves said boy and asks himself later "Do you always have to sacrifice something to protect something else?" He apparently has done that alot—enough to question it. But he doesn't enjoy it. The author says he has hardships, got saddled with alot of trouble in the war, and hides bitter things. The character seems to be a depressed fellow that deals with his sorrows by drinking, smoking, and enjoying the sex and company of women. But don't misunderstand. He actually appreciates and respects his women, thus ruling him out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>.

She is very torn up about what happened, and as it turns out, this isn't the first time she's killed someone, as in season 3, it turns out she had to shoot her drug-dealing boyfriend Todd to stop him from killing her brother Kevin with a tire iron.
</li><li> Carl Hoffman is forced by Fisk to murder his own partner Christian Blake, whom Fisk had had shot for divulging information to Matt. Hoffman is reluctant to carry out the deed, as he and Blake have been friends for 35 years; but Fisk threatens to have him killed himself unless he does the deed himself. He's tearing up as he injects a syringe filled with poison into Blake's IV line, and the guilt over his actions prompts him to go into hiding, securing protection from Leland Owlsley that lasts until Fisk kills Owlsley for stealing from him. Subsequently, Hoffman becomes the weak link that ends up bringing down Fisk.
</li><li> In season 3, it turns out that Fisk has a bunch of FBI agents on his payroll who are serving as his personal enforcers. How much they appreciate the work varies. Some like Dex take sadistic joy in doing Fisk's dirty work for him, while others are only working for him because of the dire consequences Fisk threatens to enact upon their families if they try to leave his employ. Dex and Nadeem's boss Tammy Hattley, for instance, is unrepentant about murdering an internal affairs agent to threaten Nadeem, but later privately tells Nadeem that Fisk killed one of her kids to get her to work for him, and is threatening to harm her daughter if she tries to turn on him. Nadeem himself doesn't like the work he's forced to do for Fisk after getting betrayed, but tries to rationalize it because he doesn't want to let his wife and son down. That is, until he's ordered by Fisk to be Dex's driver during a hit on Karen to avenge Wesley's death, during which Father Lantom and some innocent bystanders are killed.

While he's willing to kill Comanche for being a snitch, he takes no joy in his actions, and is very much haunted by what he had to do to someone he trusted deeply, to the point that he begins faltering in his duties for Mariah.

He takes the pain so others don't have to, because he is the one who CAN take it.
</li><li> It is revealed that in the past Eliot committed acts for which there is no excuse or justification and it is the guilt over this that drives him to do what he does. Note that it's not out of a desire for redemption, because he believes with an utter certainty that he's already damned, and has made his peace with the fact.

But Phil begins stalking New Jersey looking for Blundetto, hounding Christopher's mother, and brutally beating up Benny Fazio. It soon becomes clear that Tony's men refuse to allow themselves to be endangered all for the sake of protecting Blundetto, so Tony is forced to act. He tracks down Blundetto at their uncle Pat Blundetto's farm and kills him with a 12-gauge shotgun point-blank in order to save him from the worse fate he would've received at Phil's hands. Tony then gives Johnny Sack the location. Phil is furious to be deprived of his vengeance, but Tony and Johnny reach an accord over Blundetto's demise.

A weapon is a weapon and it really doesn't make much difference how you kill a man. If you have to kill him, well, that's the evil to start with and how you do it becomes pretty secondary.
