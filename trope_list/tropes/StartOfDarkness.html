</li><li> The flashback arc in both incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> seems at first to be the background for the highly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">mysterious</a> lead, but it's even more about the Start Of Darkness for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>.

While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Victor Creed was never that nice a guy</a>, what finally pushed him over the edge into full-blown villain territory was the death of his girlfriend Holo. Holo was a member of a ragtag rebel band of mutants that Wolverine and Creed had put together, and after a while, Creed wanted the two to throw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a> before the final fight to keep Holo safe, but she would not have it.

What probably made it worse is that, while she was dying, she used her powers to show Creed the life they could've had, with the two growing old and happy together, before cutting the illusion to reveal that she was in fact mortally wounded. Creed ends up blaming Logan, and to this day, makes it a tradition to kill any woman Logan is involved with.
</li><li> Madelyne Pryor was originally a pilot who ran into Scott Summers after the death of Jean Grey, and caught his attention because she looked exactly like Jean. After a fairly long run with the X-Men and a stable relationship with Scott that resulted in the birth of Nathan Summers (a.k.a. Cable), Madelyne discovered two things in rapid succession that had a major effect on her; first, that she was a clone of Jean Grey created by Mr. Sinister to bear Scott's child so that he (Sinister) could have a weapon to defeat his nemesis Apocalypse, and second, that Jean was still alive and that Scott had left her to go find her and return to the X-Men. This was combined with her house being invaded by Sinister, her son being kidnapped, her being shot, and a dream that involved Scott <em>stealing</em> all of her facial features to create Jean, then leave with their baby, and leaving a faceless, mouthless Madelyne to walk through a desert until she ran into a demon that offered her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>.

To get money for her sake, he agreed to take part in just one robbery, at a chemical factory he used to work at. His wife died suddenly in a freak accident, but his criminal accomplices wouldn't let him back out on the deal. Once they got to the factory, they found there were security guards that hadn't been there before, and the others got shot. Then Batman showed up and chased the future Joker, who fled by jumping into water that turned out to be chemically contaminated.

Though Dreadwing's origins are detailed as mentioned above, it's further fleshed out in the <em>Dreadwing's Myomior</em> special, which is essentially Dreadwing's past narrated by himself. Arguably effective despite the repetition, as the unbiased depictions of events from earlier serve to highlight the twisted perspective Dreadwing views his past through.

This shows (with some incredibly black humour) how a nasty and psychopathic child develops into a monster that wipes out his whole world. Although, to be fair, the reoffending rate is to all intents and purposes negligible. Darkness hardly begins to describe it... it's one of those rare origin stories that serves to completely <strong>de</strong>humanize a villain as opposed to adding a layer of tragedy. Death was always evil, even before he willingly threw away the last of his humanity.

Each degeneration can also give a character a minor derangement such as a phobia or narcissistic tendencies, which can force further sins even if the player doesn't want to do so.
<ul><li> Fits this trope because at the bottom of the scale the player becomes so irrationally self-centered and evil that they cannot be played and become an NPC.

The first failure turns you into an Unmada, a Genius who has lost touch with <em>real</em> science and believes that his wonders are the true way the world works. Unmada aren't necessarily evil, but they <em>are</em> dangerous (One could, for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">see nothing wrong</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">Skynet</a>'s modus operandi), and if they fail a further Unmada check, they completely lose themselves to Inspiration and become Illuminated (completely alien and amoral intelligences), just the same as if they had fully bottomed out their Obligation. It's both easier and more common for a Genius to become Illuminated in this way.

He and his father managed to escape, but his mother wasn't so lucky. Luca wanted to go back for her but his father said that he couldn't risk his life as the King. His mother was rescued shortly after, but she didn't return to the castle. Several months later, Luca managed to find out where she was and quickly escaped from the castle in order to meet her. He had a arduous journey, and a man took his horse in exchange for a pear and some water (Luca didn't want to eat the wild berries or drink the muddy water he found in the way). Upon finally meeting his mother, she started to scream and rip her hair out when Luca came close. One of their aids explained that she was brutally raped by the bandits and got pregnant, as well as going completely insane and unable to stand near men. Luca then snapped. He went back to the castle, but not before meeting the man who took his horse, who he murdered with joy. He was also lucky enough to find a small village along the way, and found that the bandits, as well as his mother's rapist, were sheltered in a house there. He stormed inside the hut and caught everyone off-guard, murdering everyone. When he found the rapist, he tortured and killed him gruesomely. When he returned to the castle, two things were permanently scarred on his mind: the disgust for people and the pleasure he got when killing. Thus, Luca Blight was born, a monster who causes a war for the sole reason of having an excuse to kill people by the thousands.

Bethrezen started out as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Highfather</a>'s favorite angel, to whom the Highfather gave the power to create. Bethrezen then made Nevendaar (the game world) and asked other deities to fill it with life, himself creating humans. Then Bethrezen asked the other angels to watch over the world and went to get the Highfather to show him his creation. The jealous angels messed with the mortal races, so by the time the Highfather arrived to see Nevendaar, the world was afire with war and destruction. Outraged at Bethrezen, the Highfather entombed him within the molten core of his own creation for all eternity. After millennia in the core, Bethrezen grew bitter at the Highfather and the mortal races, becoming the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil">Devil</a> and creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">Legions of the Damned</a> as his army.

Enraged, Wotan killed Gallean and threw his heart at the sun. Solonielle managed to jump and catch the heart, but her flesh was burned off. The grief, the desire for vengeance, and the pain warped Solonielle into the fleshless goddess Mortis, whoc slaughtered an entire people and raised them up as her Undead Hordes.

</li><li> Burlew makes a point of not giving away Belkar's backstory in <em>On the Origins of PCs</em> (and the Belkar backstory comic for Kickstarter donors) for similar reasons, wanting the character to remain completely, unapologetically and unmistakably evil. Although, also to keep him funny. Evil isn't funny when it has a tragic backstory, just pitiable.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: Mojo Jojo's origin was intially revealed in the episode "Mr. Mojo's Rising". As Jojo, he was once Professor Utonium's unruly pet monkey, but was ignored when the Powerpuff Girls were created (to which he learned he played a part of in the end). This would lead him into becoming the supervillain we all know. The story and trope were further expanded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirlsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirlsMovie">The Powerpuff Girls Movie</a></em>.
<ul><li> Mojo's telling of the origin paints him as someone who might come off as sympathetic but Utonium reveals that Mojo was just as unsympathetic when he was Jojo. In fact, Mojo may actually be <em>more</em> likable and sympathetic as a supervillain than he ever was when he was just a normal monkey.
