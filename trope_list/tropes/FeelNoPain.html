However, sometimes someone can't feel pain for whatever reason, usually due to nerve damage or other factors. Fiction likes to explore this idea and will often explore the consequences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">in a very philosophical way</a>.
</p><p>For humor purposes, a man may sometimes gain a temporary version when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">Distracted by the Sexy</a>.
</p><p>As in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, a person like this is very likely to accidentally injure themselves and not realize it for some time. In fiction these people also tend to develop a skewed perception of reality and may take to killing people for fun. Other times they're simply shown as tragic individuals who are literally out of touch with the rest of us. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02u5i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02u5i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02u5i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's a slight nugget of truth to this. Slight. People in pain have a tendency to show more empathy to the suffering of others, while people on pain killers shows a decrease in empathy. However, there is no literature that shows that sufferers of congenital analgesia show any anti-social tendencies above the normal rates. </span>

This is also a common feature for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a>, especially disposable ones. In such cases, the massive crippling drawbacks of not feeling pain tend to be downplayed, or, if addressed, aren't seen as a problem since they won't be alive long enough for them to have any effect.
</p><p>It's also a common trait of androids and other robotic characters. As artificial constructs with computer "brains", there's no need for any warning system about damage they've received to actually be unpleasant, just like how real-life non-sapient computers don't feel pain from error reports. If an artificial lifeform <em>can</em> feel pain in the same way we understand it, that's a sure sign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a>.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenFace">Frozen Face</a>, also stemming from nerve damage.

This trope may result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorInjuryUnderreaction">Major Injury Underreaction</a>, though the latter is usually a temporary state of affairs.

<ul><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackRockShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackRockShooter">Black★Rock Shooter</a></em> does not feel any pain. Mato experiences them instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Karas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Karas">Karas</a></em>, the hero, born to a rather messed up mafia family and more <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">apparently his brother is his father, and for half the series, he's in a coma, acting through a projection into an animated suit of transforming samurai armor, and after dying, he's reborn through the will of the City</span>, says he feels no pain, allowing him to be the enforcer to said mafia family, taking 9mm shots and still remaining at full functionality. He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also comforts a girl attempting to treat his wound he got from a demon during the local Apocalypse by saying he feels no pain so he's all right</span>. Apparently, no sensation of pain means the wound is ... just not there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">There is a justification to this,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">but it's not pretty</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Through the production of incest, it gave him a condition to which if he were to even lose his <em>arm</em>, he would not feel it</span>.
</li><li> As shown in the above picture, Yuki Nagato from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> shows no sign of pain even through being impaled by several swords through presumably vital areas. She also catches laser beams potent enough to sear through part of her hands without flinching. Whether this is truly because she does not feel pain, or if it's because she's that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a>, is unknown.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHeroZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHeroZero">Zero</a> series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Humans</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> were designed without pain receptors, and their creator thought this would make them unstoppable. However, in the story, Soubi ends up exploiting this when fighting the male Zero pair by lowering the temperature around them to dangerous levels; as a result of having no warning system, both Zeroes' bodies begin to shut down, and they can't defend themselves. Later a female pair of Zeroes are brought in, and it's eventually revealed that one of them is apparently losing her powers and <em>is</em> starting to feel pain, which she hides from the other girl.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarateShoukoushiKohinataMinoru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarateShoukoushiKohinataMinoru">Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru</a></em>, the underground fighting ring champion Kevin Norton occasionally uses PCP before entering the ring, rendering him insensitive to pain. In the end, the drugs themselves take a harder toll on his body than the blows he ignored in combat.
</li><li> Asagami Fujino in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em> chapter/movie is insensitive to pain both physically and emotionally, though she keeps this a secret from everyone else so they don't think she's abnormal. She <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has even been repeatedly raped by a gang</span> because of her passivity and her unwillingness to tell anyone about her 'pain'. She starts getting her sensation back in fits after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the gang hits her with a baseball bat</span>. The pain makes her feel more alive... and murderous. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">They</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">die</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter">messily</a>.</span> It turns out that the lack of pain is the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father medicating her as a child to seal her psychic powers before they got out of hand</span>, which has now backfired. One disadvantage to not being able to feel pain is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she doesn't even realize she has appendicitis, and would have eventually died from it if Shiki had not intervened</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Mytho is unable to feel pain because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartTrauma">lost his heart</a> and thus, his ability to feel emotions. Since his only personality trait left is to rush to the aid of anything that's helpless and in danger, he <em>constantly</em> places his own life in danger, and is completely unaware why everyone seems so freaked out by it when he does so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CynthiaTheMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CynthiaTheMission">Cynthia the Mission</a></em>, the Ripper of 2010, aka Yumiko, has this problem. Unfortunately, when she saw a show that talked about how normal humans have natural limits thanks to pain, she realizes she can do whatever she wants and normal humans can't stop her. She's proven wrong the second time she attempts to escape the insane asylum she's in, and the big sister of the girl whose eye she stabbed out kills her with a neck-shattering kick.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. While fighting a giant zombie, Chopper, the team's doctor, tells it that the fact that it can't feel pain is its greatest weakness, as it has no way of knowing how much damage its body parts are accumulating until they're so injured that they simply stop responding altogether. The Straw Hats eventually beat it by shattering its spine, leaving the thing laying on the ground wondering why it can't move.
</li><li> A similar battle occurs against a puppeteer enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, in which Kenshin blocks a pivotal joint with a rock; he points out to his opponent that a person feeling pain would have noticed the obstruction right away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hiei and Kurama were battling a giant construct designed not to feel pain. They're quick to demonstrate why not realizing how much damage your body is taking really isn't as good an idea as it seems.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">Doctor</a> altered his body chemistry to both feel no pain and to never lose consciousness. He explains this to Yusuke after he barely reacts to a limb being shot off.
</li></ul></li><li> Checkmate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UltimateMuscle">Ultimate Muscle</a></em> went through intensive training as a child to not feel pain. As with most of these cases, he loses because he can't tell what his body's limit is. This is all completely forgotten about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">once he turns good</a>.
</li><li> Al from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> by virtue of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a>. Sadly he can't (physically) feel anything else, either.
</li><li> This is what allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nut</a> Farfarello from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em> to go out kicking ass with near-total impunity. It's also indirectly implied to be why he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower">missing an eye</a> and covered in a lot of nasty-looking scars.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>, being a robot is supposed to be immune to pain, though this was sometimes portrayed inconsistently over the manga's long run, possibly justified by his AI developing to be more humanlike. Indeed, for example, in Volume 7 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Hamegg has Astro in the circus, he beats him with an electrical whip. It very clearly hurts Astro, as he cries out in pain and begs him to stop before collapsing</span>.
</li><li> Cyborg characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> universe have the option of voluntarily shutting off their body's pain receptors. This is used on multiple occasions, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hideo Kuze's attempted assassination of Prime Minister Kayabuki</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a> 2nd GIG</em>.
</li><li> Several of the '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Invisible Nines</a>' in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em> 'benefit' from this. The 901st Anti-Tank Troopers are mostly insensitive to pain at all times, and go completely numb when activating their 'Blue Lanterns' — this allows them to march through a shower of tank-shells and machinegun fire, not stopping until their bodies have been literally torn apart. Meanwhile, the flamethrower-wielding 908th 'Heat Troopers' wear suits filled with anesthetic fluid, which prevents them from noticing that the constant, oppressive heat given off by their weapon is literally melting off their skin. At the end of the war, most of them took off their suits to celebrate, only to literally fall apart as a result...
</li><li> Kahlua in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>, thanks to a "charm". While this made her nearly unstoppable in battle, as she was nearly impossible to knock out, her superior realized that this prevents her from knowing when her body is too damaged to go on.

He muses that if this makes sex less pleasurable, he'll have Calvin killed.

Modern medicine means that it won't kill him directly, but the damage it's already done to his nerves means that he has to live in a perpetual state of paranoia, constantly checking himself for injury. This is why he is so adamant that the Land cannot be real: If he allows himself to accept the healing the Land offers, he'll lose that protective paranoia, which will kill him when he returns to his original life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScannersLiveInVain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ScannersLiveInVain">Scanners Live in Vain</a>:</em> In this story, deep space is flooded with a kind of radiation that causes debilitating pain in living creatures. In order to get around this, passengers are placed in cryogenic suspension for the trip. Ships are primarily crewed by "habermans", convicted criminals whose sensory nerves have been severed to render them immune to the pain... at the cost of causing them to lose all senses other than sight. Since it's not a good idea to leave murderers and rapists in sole charge of helpless passengers, the haberman crews are supervised by the titular Scanners, an elite body who <em>volunteer</em> to undergo the haberman process. While Scanners do have access to "cranching" technology, which temporarily restores the disabled senses, it is still a major sacrifice. Much of the story consists of the POV character meditating on what the Scanners have lost by the change.

He goes as far as paying people to beat him up in the hopes that he'll feel something but nothing works. The reason why he can't feel any pain is said to be a form of PTSD after going through way too much crap in season four, culminating in letting the love of his life go so she can marry a prince and have her fairytale fantasy come true.

He can still feel Audrey Parker, which he once uses to identify a shapeshifting impostor. It's not discussed, but it seems to be coupled with a sort of minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">healing factor</a>. Even after getting his hands severely burned by a red-hot gun, he requires little more than a bandage and it heals with no scars. This is likely why he suffers from few of the side afflictions you would expect from someone with no pain. Some examples of this in action include:
<ul><li> In the episode dealing with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, Nathan is hit by a car. The injury is fatal and he collapses not long afterwards, but he <em>is</em> able to get up after the initial impact and claim to be fine.
</li><li> Nathan shares some childhood instances where he didn't realize he was injured. One time he crashed his sled into a tree, and not realizing he was injured got up to keep going. It wasn't until another girl started screaming that he realized he had <em>bones sticking out of him</em> and was covered in blood. He also mentions a time Duke and other kids slapped tacks into his back (under the guise of congratulatory pats on the back) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">placing bets on how many they could fit in</a> (16) and once again, he didn't notice until someone screamed at the blood.

</li><li> Played straight in the 3rd season, where Claire seems to lose the ability to feel pain after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sylar pokes around in her brain</span>. She's quite upset by this, as she felt that the ability to feel pain made her human.

The episode makes a point of portraying the condition relatively realistically. In a scene which is as interesting as it is freakin' hilarious, she and House (who is in constant chronic pain in his right leg) get into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryPoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryPoker">whine-off</a> over which of them has the worse deal. And in the process, she's very clear about the downsides of her condition — she has to wake up every morning and check manually to see if she scratched her corneas while sleeping, she doesn't even know it when she has a fever... House still won that contest with "I got shot". But by the end of the episode, the patient can top even that: House slices open her stomach to remove a 25-foot tapeworm from her large intestine. Without anesthesia (although the lack of anesthesia doesn't matter in the slightest with her).

The novel <em>Journey into Darkness</em>, an attempt to put together all of the bizarre crap they've thrown into his backstory, tried to set up the reason behind this as being because he has a condition called HSAN, which stands for Hereditary Sensory and Autonomous Neuropathy. Essentially, he was supposed to be completely incapable of feeling pain. However, even the book mentions that while his case is <em>severe</em>, it does seem to have some limits. Like everything else with Kane, this has been either forgotten or outright ignored as the years have gone by.

<ul><li> "Feel No Pain" is a universal special rule, which allows models to roll a dice and potentially disregard a wound even after they fail their normal armor save, provided the wound wasn't dealt by a weapon that would have invoked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Chunky Salsa Rule</a>. In some cases it's understood that this rule reflects the unit's superhuman physiology, in others it simulates the effect of having a medic in the squad providing some battlefield healing. For some specific examples from the rules and the fluff:
</li><li> Among the followers of Chaos, Khorne's Berserkers are so lost to their bloodlust that they're able to ignore most injuries, Plague Marines of Nurgle as so bloated with corruption that they won't react to any wound that doesn't immediately kill them, while followers of Slaanesh <em>do</em> notice pain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist">and enjoy it.</a>
</li><li> Among loyalist Space Marine chapters, Salamanders get a chapter trait that gives them an FNP roll against wounds caused by flame weapons, reflecting their background as a cult of blacksmiths on a highly volcanic world. The Blood Angels' Death Company, meanwhile, are not only insane with bloodlust, they're also hallucinating the events leading up to their Primarch's death.
</li><li> Orks have such an extremely robust (and partially fungus-based) physiology that they can survive decapitation long enough for a Dok to set them up for a "body transplant." On the subject of Ork physicians, it's an open question whether a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">Painboy</a> gives his mob an FNP roll because he's on-hand to provide medical care, or whether they're so afraid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatGrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatGrinderSurgery">said medical care</a> that they're willing to disregard a little thing like a bolter round blowing a chunk out of them.
</li><li> The tabletop RPG system has Feels no Pain as a minor mutation, offering a larger number of Wounds while mentioning no external signs of mutation, making it one of the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedwithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedwithSuck">beneficial mutations</a>.

One of the arguments for the superiority of cyberware over the less invasive bioware is that cyberware's simsense (what allows you to feel through the artificial limb) can be turned on and off at will; someone stabbing you unexpectedly in a cybernetic limb will hurt as much as getting stabbed in a normal arm, but you can turn that off immediately and perform such feats as grabbing the smoking barrel of a gun without feeling pain or suffering damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> this requires both the disadvantage of "Numb" and the advantage of "High Pain Threshold". Cruelly, "Numb" makes it so you can feel <em>only</em> pain.

<ul><li> Immunity to pain isn't a much sought-after ability since it has little effect in the game. Only a few spells, feats or special abilities are described as using pain to cause their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect">Status Effect</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits (constructs, elementals, oozes, plants and undead) are also considered immune to pain.
</li><li> A couple of drugs from the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, Sannish and Luhix, can grant immunity to pain for a few hours. Sannish last longer, is cheap, has little side effects and isn't too addictive. Luhix (made from plants from the Abysses), on the other hand, is insanely expensive and its vicious addictive level makes it closer to a slow poison than an actual drug — without magic to counter the lasting effects, a single dose is likely to kill even a high-level character in a few days. However, Luhix is stronger as it can protect from pain-induced damage, while Sannish only protects from penalties.
</li><li> Trolls in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a></em> setting feel no pain in addition to traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">D&amp;D-trollish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>.

At Essence 5+, with By Agony Empowered active, you can have multiple open aggravated wounds, and yet you keep fighting at full capacity until your Incapacitated health level gets marked off with aggravated damage. With the right Overdrive charms and Driven Beyond Death, you can arrange to then stand up <em>again</em>, go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>, and wreak havoc, still without being debilitated by your wounds.

"Like the Living" or better gives them that quality back — even though they don't suffer real damage from heavy blows, it <em>feels</em> like it, and thus they lose their next action if they take significant injury from a single attack. The sourcebook <em>Atlas of the Living Dead</em> adds the Feel No Pain quality, which removes that drawback from the higher Senses traits, allowing for zombies with incredible perception and a complete lack of concern about injury.
</li><li> Tortogs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonMech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonMech">DragonMech</a></em> setting only really feel pain when something punches through their shell. It's what makes them great smugglers — when night is virtually guaranteed to bring anything from a stinging micrometeorite hail to a full-on orbital strike, you don't need speed to get around — you need durability, and tortogs are <em>good</em> at durability.

In gameplay terms, it means that whatever damage is inflicted on a Cyclops, won't affect it until its next turn — a potent ability, since it enables the Cyclops to always counterattack with his full strength, even if the attack should've killed him. And better yet, it can trick people into wasting more attacks on a unit that is technically already dead — he just hasn't realized it yet. Oh, and if you're clever, there's a number of spells you can use to take further advantage of it in various insidious ways... so in that universe, at least, being unable to feel pain is a definite advantage.

<ul><li> There are two levels to pain immunity. One level is simply not feeling pain (possibly in addition to simply not feeling <em>anything</em>). Another level is to actually feel the sensation of pain, but utterly lack the knowledge and instinct that pain is anything but a different kind of feeling. In the latter case, the aversion or unpleasantness associated with pain just isn't there. In both cases, there's a variety of things that can cause it, none of them pleasant:
</li><li> Leprosy is such a debilitating disease because it destroys the nerve receptors, causing its victims to neglect injuries; in time, the wounds become infected to the point of needing amputation. But during the Crusades, armies actually exploited this phenomenon by offering men with leprosy a final chance to serve God and country. While "leprous crusaders" could still swing a sword, they couldn't feel injuries. This reputation as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a>, even discounting the fact that just bleeding on their foes could cause an outbreak of one of the most feared diseases of the old world, made them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> in any battle where they appeared. The fictional character of Thomas Covenant exploits this concept.
</li><li> Peripheral neuropathy (numbness in the extremities) is a common feature of type 2 diabetes. Combined with reduced circulation, small wounds on the feet frequently lead to a downhill slide which begins with small injuries going unnoticed, turning into gangrene, leading to amputations, which prevents exercise because the patient isn't really very mobile anymore, but they still eat the same as they did before, they gain weight, the condition advances, they get another injury which goes unnoticed, gangrene sets in, repeat until dead. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22pc3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22pc3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22pc3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is believed to have been the chain of events that led to the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a></span> In some smaller communities in the US, particularly in the South and Southwest, a diagnosis of adult-onset diabetes is essentially terminal — because so few will change their diet or watch their blood sugar levels, they will very frequently enter this downhill slide, and be dead within five years.
</li><li> There are rare genetic conditions that keep some people from feeling pain for their whole life. As a result, they tend not to live long, since they never learn to avoid injury, and can't determine its seriousness even when they've noticed that everything's not right with their body.
<ul><li> One such condition is CIPA, Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis. Besides not feeling pain, they can't feel temperature and don't sweat. Overheating is a constant problem and leading cause of death in babies. People with this condition must constantly check for injuries, monitor their body temperature, check orifices for cuts or bleeding, etc. There are only about 20-30 people in the world with this condition at any one time, and it obviously shows up much, much more frequently in fiction. A good profile of CIPA can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/ashlyn-blocker-feels-no-pain.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> People with CIPA sort of just "fall apart" in their 30s or 40s, as they do not subconsciously shift their weight when they are sitting still or sleeping. This results in great damage to their joints and most of the patients eventually die of arthritis complications.
</li></ul></li><li> A second condition called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/health/woman-pain-anxiety.html">FAAH-OUT<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> affects a gene that encodes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The impaired gene causes Jo Cameron to not feel pain, and an accompanying absence of anxiety. However, she also tends to heal more quickly from light injuries and can withstand surgery without anesthesia. Only by noticing other signs of impaired function did she discover that she needed hip surgery. She believes she inherited the mutation from her father (who passed away before studies revealed her own condition), and her son inherited only part of the condition, reducing his experience of pain.
<ul><li> Curiously, while you might think people with these conditions would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">unable to empathize with people who do feel pain</a>, they usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">have just as much empathy as normal.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow">Robert Wadlow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the tallest man in medical history (almost nine feet!), could not feel pain in his feet, so he didn't know a leg brace caused a blister, which got infected, which killed him at only 22 years old.
</li><li> Individuals under the influence of PCP are said to be completely detached from any pain stimuli, to the point that police often find them nearly impossible to take down short of crippling them. The standard protocol for taking down a rampaging person high on PCP is to make them unable to walk by damaging or restraining their limbs so they can't be used.
</li><li> Powerful painkillers such as morphine often work by depressing the entire central nervous system, which can result in obliviousness to pain.
<ul><li> For a powerful localized painkiller, there are sodium channel blockers such as Novocaine. As the name implies, it works by blocking signals in your nervous system, so your brain literally does not register any feeling at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain drugs, including PCP (see above), synthetic adrenaline, and others are often used by militia and insurgents (e.g. insurgents in Mogadishu and Fallujah) to give them increased staying power in combat; though they can still bleed out, the painkillers will dull any pain and keep their hearts pumping even after they should be clinically dead.
</li><li> Nomads in the Sahara Desert gain very tough soles on their feet from years of walking through the sands. As a result, some can actually put their feet in a low fire and not even feel it!
<ul><li> Veteran British tea drinkers, who pick the bags out of almost-boiling water with their bare hands and then squeeze out the strongest tea with their fingertips, have similarly resistant digits.
</li><li> Long-time chefs, cooks and bakers get this too and can reach into hot ovens or flip things over in frying pans — with their fingers...
</li><li> This even extends to long time microbiologists, having spent years working next to a Bunsen burner flame most can carry out the work without even feeling the heat and only notice it after a few seconds of coming into contact with the flame.
</li></ul></li><li> Bad lacerations or burns can result in nerve damage that makes it impossible to feel pain (or anything else) in the affected limb(s). This is actually the definition of a third-degree burn, when a burn goes so deep and does so much damage to the nerve tissue that it <em>stops hurting</em>; this frustrates paramedics since the patient has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">refuse help</a>. Depending on the extent of the damage and follow-up medical treatment, this may be temporary or permanent. As with the other real-life examples, this can be a major risk factor as a person unable to feel pain in their arm can, for instance, place their hand on a stove and not realize that the stove is actually on at the time until they happen to look down and notice their hand is smoking.
</li><li> Pain asymbolia, a.k.a. Pain dissociation is a rare condition that, unlike CIPA, is not a genetic condition, but is generally acquired through external means, including injury to the brain, lobotomy, cingulotomy or morphine analgesia. People with this condition can actually feel pain, however it doesn't bother them. The associated unpleasantness that comes with, say, breaking your arm, does not phase them at all. They recognize the feeling and sensation of pain, they will know that they broke their arm, unlike someone suffering from CIPA, but it simply doesn't bother them as much or they are completely immune to the suffering that comes with it.
