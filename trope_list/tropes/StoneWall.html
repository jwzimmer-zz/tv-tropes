The Stone Wall's offense is nothing to write home about, if it even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">technically exists</a>. But he's tough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Really, really tough</a>. And if anything can put him down, odds are he's quick enough on the recovery to get right back up for round two.
</p><p>When alone, a Stone Wall's strategy is often known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">turtling</a>": a battle of attrition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">see who tires out or makes a mistake first</a>, or a waiting game until the whistle blows. If his defense is something he physically constructs and builds, he can win a fight by slowly expanding outward until he leaves the enemy without a foot to stand on. Often has defensive buffs and minor healing magic, in which case you're dealing with a "Paladin Tank." In rare cases, he may also have access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">Fixed-Damage Attacks</a>, which by their very nature ignore stats, giving them at least a little access to actual offensive power. However, more offensively oriented characters will still always have a higher damage output with regular attacks. Although in very rare cases, typically at a high level, he'll gain access to an attack that scales off his Defense rather than his Attack, allowing him to finally deal some serious damage at last.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Alternatively, Stone Walls can try the opposite tactic, berserking: throwing themselves at the enemy without a thought for defense. Relying on their inherent toughness to keep them alive, Stone Walls can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">suicidal tactics</a> to make up for their dismal attack power. This strategy is especially common for Stone Walls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort">whose toughness is completely automatic</a>, rather than something they need to work at.
</p><p>In team settings, a Stone Wall often takes care of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">tanking</a>" duties, interposing himself between the enemy and an ally, typically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> that can take care of dealing damage while the Stone Wall takes care of defense. By keeping the enemy occupied, he allows allies with greater attack strength but poorer defense to kill the enemy without getting killed. Characters who do this are called "Meat Shields" or "Party Tanks." They often have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro">moves</a> designed to force attention to themselves. Sometimes called "Control Tanks". In television shows, the Stone Wall is rarely the protagonist, because viewers want a main character who can kick ass themselves.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This build has a number of flaws that can be exploited. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">Fixed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">percent damage attacks</a>, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">armor piercing attacks</a>, ignore their thick defenses. Defense-reduction debuffs may be somewhat effective in exposing them to peril, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">damage-over-time debuffs</a> are invariably fatal unless cured. And if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakMeter">break meter</a> is directly tied to your defensive ability, expect anything with the ability to damage it to do so with extreme prejudice. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstakillMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstakillMook">Instakill Mook</a> will also be able to one-shot it as if its defenses aren't even there.
</p><p>This trope partly takes its name from a real-life example: Confederate General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson won the battle of Bull Run due to his strategy to not retreat from his line, no matter how bad things went for him. And for a while, things went pretty bad. General Jackson himself is not an example of this trope despite the nickname, as outside of that particular battle, he was most noted for his offensive campaigns.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, which is the inverse with strong offense and weak defense, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, which is tough and fast without sacrificing strength. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, who is strong but lacks speed. Not an unusual trait of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Cowardly Lion</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a>.

<ul><li> This is the character trait of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Green</a> characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>. The Green King is known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">The Invulnerable</a>, is so durable he can only lose battles by time out, and regularly goes monster hunting alone. Even lesser greens have similar durability, however, with the level one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Lime Bell</a> failing to even take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> from people several levels higher than herself.
<ul><li> Interestingly some of the most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Reds</a> have this trait as well, with Scarlet Rain, the red king, possessing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Immovable Fortress</a> which withstood dozens of players attacking her at once, and Crimson Kingbolt having the ability to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha">Giant Mecha</a> out of scrap metal powerful enough to withstand a legendary monster
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Yuuno</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Scrya</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> is a second or third tier combatant at most, not just because he's the only mage in the cast without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand">magic-boosting Device,</a> but also because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">he doesn't have much talent at conventional offensive magic</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xxqd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xxqd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xxqd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fans have noted that as the only mage who's demonstrated the ability to teleport other people <em>against their will</em>, Yuuno is technically capable of some very potent unconventional offense. But he's much too nice a guy to do things like teleport people into the sun or teleport only <em>some</em> of their body away from the battlefield.</span> However, his defenses are actually <em>stronger</em> than those of the Device-using mages (at least stronger than Nanoha's, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">by her own admission in the Sound Stages</a>), which allows him to play the "Meat Shield" role and free them up to concentrate on offensive tactics. Once, though, he had to fight somewhat like a Berserker, throwing himself at Vita to keep her occupied. Even a wall is daunting when it's flying right at you. He didn't manage to hurt her, but she also failed to hurt him.
</li></ul><ul><li> Yakumo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3×3 Eyes</a></em> is a berserker type meat shield (emphasis on the 'meat'), as all he has is the amazing power to not die; his job is to stand in front of attacks and be dismembered. He later learns how to fight effectively.
</li><li> Zushi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> is able to form barriers to soften truck-force attacks to where he's unharmed by them (he can still be knocked down, though he can also soften the impact upon landing), but he can barely fight otherwise. The barrier is invisible to an untrained eye, so from the point of view of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a>, it looks like the boy is impervious to damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, Kuwabara clearly takes this role in the main team, with Yusuke being the damage dealer, Hiei as the speedster and Kurama having the sharp mind. Kuwabara doesn't have highly damaging moves like the Spirit Gun or Dragon of the Darkness flame. However, you know you have good durability if you managed to still get up after being in a tug-o-war with Byakko's tigers, repeatedly thrown down to the stone stadium floor by Rinku and stabbed in over 10 different areas by the Elder Toguro.
<ul><li> Sensui recalls thus during his fight, mentioning playing an RPG where he maxed out his character before facing the final boss: he's so overequipped that the boss can barely scratch him, but his attacks have long since hit the Damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> and he's facing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, meaning even his 9999-damage attacks take many, many turns to bring the boss down. This related to the heroes facing him, because none of them could really hurt him either, but their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> was keeping Sensui from taking them down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>: In comparison to some of the higher tiers of the series, Sanosuke can come off as this; his attacks aren't always the strongest (at least in comparison to Saitou or Kenshin), but his endurance is one of his most outstanding traits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> <br/><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters</a></em>, the Player Killer of Darkness (Panik in the dub) is noted to be one of these. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, his main card is Castle of Dark Illusions, which has high defense, minimal attacking power, and makes his monsters impossible to attack. He also favors the use of Chaos Shield, which raises the defense of his monsters even further, but it locks his cards in place and keeps them from moving or attacking. This becomes his downfall, as it makes his strategy very inflexible.
</li><li> Mukuro in the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> favors a Vehicle Deck. All his cards have 0 ATK, but due to the format he plays in (where the Duel is more of a race and attacking, even with a card with no ATK, slows the opponent down a little), he can win Duels by simply attacking once, then stalling until he wins the race.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> anime had Team Taiyou, whose decks consisted primarily of low-level Normal Monsters, giving them no offense whatsoever outside of Speed World 2. Their strategy was to play Holding-Hands Majinn, a card that ups its DEF by that of all your monsters via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship">Power of Friendship</a> and makes itself the target of all attacks, and Scrum Force, which keeps DEF-position monsters from being destroyed by card effects. This left them with an essentially unbreakable defense, letting them use the aforementioned Speed World 2 to chip away at the opponent and fulfil the requirements to summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Sleeping Giant Zushin.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The Bando Spiders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, especially before Akaba was allowed to play again. They mostly score on field goals and don't rack up big yardage, but their defense is smothering.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: Koro-sensei normally isn't a Stone Wall, but his last-ditch Ultimate Defense Technique takes the trope to an extreme: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With an explosion, he condenses most of his body into a ball-shaped crystal barrier around him, which makes him totally invulnerable.

There is no known upper limit to how much he can take, so for all intents and purposes, Botamo is invulnerable. However, he has only rudimentary skill in fighting, is very slow, and cannot fly.

That is, she depends on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">pragmatism</a> and creative use of her other skills to defeat even mook enemies.

She later gains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">a sword that heals whatever it hits</a> and an upgraded version of her bubble shield spell that surrounds the opponent instead and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">can reflect weaker attacks back at them</a>. Until she finally gains a strong attack spell much later in the story, she has to rely on allies for attack power and act as their support to defeat any enemies, and even after gaining her strong attack she remains primarily a defender because it can only be used when she is extremely angry.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk">Risk</a></em>, there's always at least one person who will want to conquer Australia and then just sit there and build up troops while everyone else weakens each other. Since Australia only has one path in and out, massing all the troops on one territory makes it almost impossible to conquer without using every last one of your available armies. You have to take out Australia within the first few rounds or you're screwed. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyNewAustralia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyNewAustralia">No wonder Lex Luthor wanted it.</a>) However, it also only shares a border with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Asia</a>, which very few players go for, meaning that it is logistically difficult for an Australia player to put their troops in a position to accomplish much on offense.

A player who has Gandhi in play is not allowed to play Aggressions or Wars himself, but anyone trying to attack him has to spend twice as many military actions to do so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em>, the concept of prophylaxis could be described as this. Rather than playing to improve your attacking chances, a prophylactic move is one that limits the opponent's opportunities. Former world champion Tigran Petrosian is probably the best example; while he had fewer wins than other world champions, he had almost no losses, even going through 1962 without losing a single tournament game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a></em>, this is the usual strategy for Italy since it is surrounded on three sides by water and land-based attack routes into Italy from the north is hampered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeutralZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeutralZone">impassable Switzerland</a>. These geographic features makes both attacking Italy <em>and</em> Italy attacking anyone difficult — in tournament play it is statistically both the least likely country to win and the least likely country to be eliminated outright.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Card Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Rock-type is mainly geared toward Turtling play, as Rock-types tend to have low ATK and high DEF, as well as quite a few of them having the ability to flip into face-down Defensive Position. There was even a Rock-type Structure Deck at one point built entirely on building an uber-strong defense. Formerly shown above was Labyrinth Wall, which does nothing to most other monster cards on its own, but has 3000 DEF, meaning it can shrug off even an attack from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a>. This later evolved into the somewhat more aggressive Rock Stun; its offensive strategy was pretty much the "swing with Level 4 1900 beaters" tactic that'd gone out of fashion long ago, but it could shut down most anything the opponent did to stop those beaters from slowly hacking through their defenses and LP.
</li><li> There are also cards like Spirit Reaper and Marshmallon, who simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">can't be killed</a> in battle, but have some of the worst stats in the game (though they often have some damaging effects, such as Spirit Reaper's attack-and-your-opponent-discards effect, and Marshmallon doing 1000 damage when attacked face-down).
</li><li> Decks that focus on alternate win conditions look like this. Final Countdown Decks typically feature a crapload of defensive cards and not much else, and Burn or Mill Decks often completely ignore attacking the opponent in favor of stalling while they whittle down their resources. No presence, no offensive power... so they make it as hard as possible to get a hit in while they try to complete their own strategy.
</li><li> Ghostricks have almost no attacking power whatsoever, and their fluff depicts them as a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCute">Creepy Cute</a> benign spirits who play pranks on people, then run and hide — to that end, many of them are based around flipping themselves to face-down DEF. However, they also have a truly absurd number of cards based around blocking attacks, redirecting hits, or reducing damage, making getting a hit in on them fairly difficult. A game with a Ghostrick player can stretch out for quite a while. The archetype also has multiple ways of winning without making significant attacks, including Skeleton's milling, Warwolf's burn damage, and Angel of Mischief's instant win condition.
</li><li> Herald of Perfection (and its upgraded form, Herald of Ultimateness) have subpar ATK for a Ritual of their level, but impressive DEF and the ability to negate any effect simply by discarding a Fairy. They can block pretty much anything the opponent tries, but they can't do much by themselves and eat up too much of your resources to support other strategies easily. Herald decks tend to be based on sitting on the guy while trying to assemble their own win condition.
</li><li> Yubel has a rather nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> ability, is indestructible by battle, and upgrades itself when destroyed by other means, but it has no stats at all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance">(in the real game)</a> cannot use its effect while attacking, meaning you need to lure the opponent into hitting it.
</li><li> Stardust Dragon's offensive stats are poor at best for a Level 8 Synchro, but its ability to block destruction-based effects by tributing and reviving itself gives it (and your other cards) much more survivability than others of its kind.
</li></ul></li><li> Walls and other creatures with Defender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> are essentially this; by the very definition of the ability they can't attack and many deal little or no damage to enemy attacking creatures that they block. On the other hand, they can be very tough for a relatively low cost; the actual <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45368">Wall of Stone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> card is a good example.
<ul><li> Among creatures that can actually attack, this is the defining trait of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">treefolk</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=152967">Indomitable Ancients<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the most extreme example: It can dish out 2 damage but can take up to 10 and has no other abilities. The card <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244674">Doran, the Siege Tower<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is specifically designed to invert this and turn such creatures into powerhouses by making all creatures deal combat damage equal to their toughness instead of their power, a windfall for most treefolk.
</li><li> Throughout <em>Magic</em>'s history, there have been entire decks dedicated to turtling, creating an impenetrable defense that allows them to win through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> or by forcing an opponent to run out the clock by running out of cards to draw. Snow White and Project X both seek to gain absurd amounts of life through combos, ensuring your opponent will never take you down to 0. The classic blue-white control deck has hardly any win conditions, but tons of removal and permission spells to keep them alive. And then there's...
</li><li> Turbofog, everyone's least favorite <em>Lorwyn</em>-era tourney deck! It had very <em>few</em> creatures, defensive or otherwise, but stuffs itself with damage prevention, counterspells, control, life-gain, and just a few cards to recycle itself and increase its runtime. Its only win condition is to last <em>so damn long</em> that the opponent's deck runs out of cards (an instant lose), or more likely that the opponent simply loses patience and accepts their (eventual) defeat.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Trading Card Game, Shedinja makes a Stone Wall not out of itself, but the player: Shedinja does not count towards the 6 Pokémon to knock out to win a game, so someone packing a deck full of Shedinja would force the opponent into a war of attrition. Infamously during its time, a mirror match between Shedinja decks in the Long Beach Regionals went into overtime and remained in overtime for <em>90 minutes</em> due to neither player being able to inflict a knockout that counted.
<ul><li> The Durant Mill deck can also be viewed as a case of this: It's not meant to attack, but to last long enough to completely deplete the opponent's deck, relying on a rule in which a player loses if his or her deck is empty at the beginning of his or her turn.
</li><li> Before that was the Mewtwo Mulligan deck. Mewtwo had a move where you discard 1 Psychic Energy attached to it, and Mewtwo could not be affected by any of the opponent's attacks. As a result, a viable competitive deck popped up containing 1 Mewtwo and the rest Psychic Energy, to attach onto Mewtwo and be discarded each turn until the opponent's deck runs out. In addition, a Mulligan, hence the deck's name, is a rule in which if you don't have any usable Pokémon in your initial hand, your opponent draws a card. This rule made it very likely your opponent will have fewer cards in his or her deck than you, guaranteeing you a win later on. This strategy got so out of hand, as there were no real counters to it at the time, that the Mulligan rule was changed to make drawing the card optional to defang this deck.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Little Alchemist</em>, there are cards that have zero base Attack but high enough Defense to negate all but the most powerful attacks, including a literal Great Wall. It's still possible to (eventually) defeat an enemy who uses a lot of these cards, though, by setting your class to Elementalist and gradually whittling down their health with minor but unblockable combo damage dealt every turn.

The robot's pneumatic flipper had some punch but was nothing special in a tournament where most robots had mechanisms to help them flip back over, but it was armoured with steel which was successively thickened and reinforced over the years and even boasted a thick rear shield made of cobalt-titanium; even Razer and Hypnodisc, both known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> for their highly destructive weapons, did absolutely nothing against it. The robot was also intentionally designed to have a decent gap between the plating and the internals so anything that did penetrate would be unlikely to hit anything vulnerable. In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mafkz13arHQ">a famous match<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> against the former, Hypnodisc ripped off Bigger Brother's flipper and shredded its armour, and Bigger Brother <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">still beat it</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots">BattleBots</a></em> has its fair share too:
<ul><li> The aptly-named Turtle has no weapons but is a wedge on all sides (meaning opponents and their weapons are more likely to slide over it) and has some rather tough armor, tough enough to be the first bot to have ever broken the spinning blades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">3-time champion Hazard</a> (which demolished most of its other opponents in that and following years).
</li><li> Zion is a simple rectangular wedge (though it later had an arm that slowly moved upward) but was one of the few middleweight bots to have never been knocked out—every match Zion participated in had it remaining in working order to the end, even the rumbles in which many bots face each other (and it was picked on in its first one)—in other words, there was absolutely nothing in its weight class capable of taking it down, including <em>two</em> fights against Hazard. Pretty impressive for a bot created out of a church's youth group program.
</li><li> DUCK! only has a small, ineffective flipper as its primary weapon, but because it is so ridiculously durable, it simply outlasts enemy bots that break <em>themselves</em> when attacking it. It has advanced to the late stages of tournaments in spite of always being the underdog due to its lack of offense.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a>:
<ul><li> The traditional role of the opening batsmen is to play defensively and hang around and blunt the initial barrage of the opposition's fast bowlers in order to set up the team's innings, often scoring quite slowly. (In)famous "Stonewallers" include Bill Lawry for Australia and Geoffrey Boycott for England. However, in recent years, ODI and Twenty20 cricket especially have featured more aggressive openers, as the strategy has been to exploit the fielding restrictions that are in place early in the innings. Making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope">something of a comeback</a> in Test matches: England in particular have capitalized on the "dropping attention span" of some of their opponents: witness the efforts of their current top order, Andrew Strauss, Alistair Cook and Jonathan Trott. Though granted, all three of them score faster than Boycott did.
</li><li> Bowlers can also be Stone Walls, looking more to dry up runs and pressure batsmen into making mistakes than take wickets through attacking bowling. In an inverse of the situation in batting, this type of bowler is <em>more</em> popular in T20 and ODI than in Tests.
</li><li> And finally, <em>fielders</em> - many cricket fans have seen shots that looked like they were certain to go for four stopped by spectacular saves from a fielder. South Africa's Jonty Rhodes was particularly well known for this.
</li></ul></li><li> "Turtle-balling" is a common tactic in American Football, in which the offense does just enough to gain a lead of more than one score, then uses a combination of stifling defense and a relentless running game to prevent the opponent from catching up. Bill Cowher, Pittsburgh Steelers coach in the 1990s and early 2000s, perfected the technique; when his teams built a lead of 11 or more points <em>at any point in the game</em>, victory was practically guaranteed. In such situations, his teams lost once and tied once... <em>and won 102 times</em>.
</li><li> William Felton Russell. He didn't score much and his shooting percentages were mediocre, but he is an 11-time NBA champion, 5-time MVP and widely considered the greatest defender in NBA history.
</li><li> Pitchers in the National League. The pitcher generally has a very low batting average (though some have one that rivals other position players), and often a low speed, too, but they are the standard bearer for the defense to the point of being analogous to a goalkeeper. The position is so specialized that the American League has a rule that you are permitted to have one designated hitter to hit in place of one defensive player without taking him out of the game — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">virtually everybody chooses to bat for the pitcher.</a> The one major exception since the introduction of the DH in the 1980's is San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgardner, and he is considered extremely remarkable <em>because</em> of how unusual it is for a pitcher to hit as well as he has.
<ul><li> Catchers are generally either this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>; squatting so much tends to ruin your knees, making them rather slow on the bases so their offensive capabilities tend to be limited to raw power. Defensively, the catcher is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> to the pitcher, because the catcher must catch (or at least secure) strike three in order to complete a strikeout, pitches that are not fouled off by the batter are live (and so runners can attempt to advance before, during or after a pitch) and because the catcher's job is to guard home plate. Pitchers get credited for wins like goalkeepers, but catchers look the part because of the protective gear.
</li></ul></li><li> Boxing:
<ul><li> The rope-a-dope strategy, as best seen in the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Wait against the ropes, guard face, taunt during clinches, throw occasional jab to opponent's face. Repeat until opponent is tired, <em>then</em> start delivering beatdown.
</li><li> In the 1980 heavyweight fight between Randall 'Tex' Cobb (who had one of the most durable chins in the history of boxing) and Earnie Shavers (widely regarded as the hardest puncher in heavyweight history) Cobb, who was not known for great offense, won the fight by simply <em>walking through</em> Shavers' punches until Shavers tired and Cobb was able to knock him out.
</li><li> Boxing has also seen a number of fighters over the years who specialize in defense to the point of being all but untouchable, and only need to use a minor amount of offense because their opponent simply can't land anything on them. A few such fighters include Willie Pep, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8aerkHG_7A">Niccolino Locche<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq6ZLecsWyU">Wilfredo Benitez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw1t2yAK_wU">Pernell Whitaker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK9en6g9JTQ">Floyd Mayweather<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zUut60gfkU">Muhammad Ali<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was this at times, mostly in his youth, and even <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxHERzmAd_g">Mike Tyson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was most famous for his power, showed some of this ability as well.
</li><li> Canadian boxer George Chuvalo, was famous for his ability to take a beating from anybody. He stayed in the ring with the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman, and was never knocked down. After his first match against Ali, which he lost on points, Chuvalo joked that "Sure, I lost the match. But afterwards, Ali went to the hospital with bleeding kidneys, and I went out dancing with my wife."
</li><li> Joe Grim could barely box like a true professional, but could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeofIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeofIron">take a beating from nearly any boxer</a>. In fact, he won his matches by <em>letting his opponents wail away at him until they get too exhausted to fight any longer and punching them out with all his might</em>. Research also showed that his skull was twice as thick around the brain as an average human skull.

He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">a fairly inept physical combatant despite his natural strength</a>, but he was also infamous for being virtually impossible to knock down. He tangoed with some of the best MMA fighters of his day, rarely getting in any hits, but also surviving blows that would have sent lesser men sprawling. Similar to Joe Grim, he often took home wins because the opponent was too exhausted to keep going - in his match against Ken Shamrock, he won when Shamrock started having <em>heart palpitations.</em>

Another common term, coined by former Chelsea coach José Mourinho, is "parking the bus" for the occasions where everyone is put in front of the goal. Prevalent national teams that follow(ed) this are Switzerland — the "Catenaccio" was even first known as "Swiss Bolt"; in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> in 2006, they were eliminated without conceding a single goal in four games — and Ireland — in three World Cups, tied 8 out of 13 games, scored and conceded 10 goals, only once scored more than one goal, and highest amount against was <em>2</em>.

There have been names coined to collectively describe those defensive units in American football lore; to name a few, the Pittsburgh Steelers had the "Steel Curtain", the New York Giants had the "Big Blue Wrecking Crew", the Minnesota Vikings had the "Purple People Eaters", and the Seattle Seahawks had the "Legion of Boom".
</li><li> The Neutral Zone Trap in ice hockey could become an effective version of this in a usually fast-paced sport. When a team used the trap, often to protect a lead, their five mobile players would all move into the neutral zone and force the other team to try and muscle their way through, which rarely worked, or just dump the puck into the defensive team's end and hope they could get to it first. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> was later implemented in several leagues to make it harder to successfully use the trap to slow down the game; one of the reasons the trap worked was because a rule prevented a pass from being made from behind a team's blue line past the center (red) line, preventing long passes that could circumvent the trap. That rule was removed, allowing teams to break out more easily.

<ul><li> Anyone making use of a one-handed weapon and a held shield in <em>D&amp;D</em> is a lesser example of this trope regardless of their class, suffering a substantial loss of offensive power compared to a two-handed weapon. (<em>D&amp;D</em> is also subject to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a> trope in many editions, thereby negating the point of such an approach. In 4th edition, however, it was a viable strategy; some characters equipped with shields could render themselves virtually impossible to hit in two defenses.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay">The "Lockdown" build</a>, which wields a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">long-reach weapon</a>, focuses on making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">attacks of opportunity</a> in response to as many types of action as possible, then uses them to deliver nondamaging attacks which halt movement. While it will take a Lockdown user longer to defeat his enemies than one that counterattacks normally, it means he can keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant">Close Range Combatants</a> from getting close enough to attack him, and prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">Long Range Fighters</a> from getting far enough away to do the same.
</li><li> The Knight class from the 3.5 <em>Player's Handbook II</em> is a meatshield type- their offensive skills are not much compared to a Fighter, but have the Knight's Challenge mechanic, allowing them such tricks as forcing all moderately-powerful enemies to attack the Knight in preference to any other party member or cause all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">less-than-moderately-powerful enemies</a> to cower in fear. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with their capstone ability, the appropriately-named "Loyal Beyond Death".

</li><li> The Spring Attack feat line allows a character to attack in the middle of their move, and it requires both decent Dexterity and two feats that boost Armor Class. Because of this, it makes the character tricky to attack and hard to hit when they do get attacked. However, it also heavily drops damage, since you only get one attack per turn while on the move, and it takes up feats that could be used to boost your strength. It's mostly not favored, since while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">kiting the opponent to death</a> sounds appealing, it takes so much longer than the alternative that the enemy can simply ignore the Spring Attacker and eat the rest of the party in the meantime.
</li><li> Monks in 3.x are often seen as this. Though their hitpoints are average, pushing everything to their defensive stats can make them impressively survivable, their saves are great, they're very fast, they receive Spell Resistance and Evasion, and they're among the few characters that can consistently dodge Touch-based attacks. However, their damage (especially while using their superior mobility) is decidedly below average, and pushing those points into Dexterity and Wisdom leaves little room for Strength, which makes things even worse. A common joke about monks is that they're the best class in the game for surviving, and not much else.
</li><li> The Survivor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> has a number of handy defensive abilities and good save bonuses, but it's the only class in the game to have no Base Attack Bonus at all.

Usually this is more of a deterrent and leaves the wolf with no attacking ability, but a pack with enough sufficiently strong wolves can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">then push their large, prickly packmate down inclines and towards unhappy targets.</a>

</li><li> It is very simple to build an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalt</a> like this, since defensive and offensive skills and abilities are bought separately — there is nothing stopping you from investing your entire divine power into defense, becoming all but completely untouchable, while still remaining completely rubbish at attacking. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5fkxi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5fkxi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5fkxi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mind you, an Exalt who is "completely rubbish" at something by Exalted standards is still likely to be at least adequate at it by ordinary mortal standards.</span>

</li><li> As far as the magic paths go, this is the combat modus operandi of the Creation path. Heals, regeneration, resistance boosts (both status and elemental), extra maximum health, powerful shielding, cannon fodder minion spawning that also tends to be most competent defensively, and more besides; on the flip side, Creation has no damage spells and very few aggressive spells at all (and most of those can also double as buffs).

Getting Y-Wings to actually hurt people reliably generally requires buying either a turret or a couple of racks of torpedoes, and getting them to move at speed reliably basically requires you to be playing Scum and Villainy.

The more pacifistic among the Earth Shugenja are prone to exploiting this, simply responding to violence by armoring themselves up and waiting for the aggressor to give up once it becomes obvious they're not accomplishing anything.

However, the Giant defensive style is very guarded and difficult to crack; early in a match, they can't be thrown even with the simplest takedowns, and have to be worn down gradually with strikes and submissions. Also, the lack of effective offensive weapons means there are a lot of points left to put into defense for Create-A-Wrestlers.

</p><ul><li> In classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, this role falls to most non-hitscan enemies. They have better defenses than the zombie chaingunners and shotgunners, but lack their undodgeable attacks. The Pinky in particular has above-average health, but is restricted to a rather slow melee attack, making it borderline harmless in a one-on-one fight as long as the player keeps backing up. Fanmade maps tend to use these enemies as meatshields, forcing the player to either get around them or blast through them before the chaingunners chew through their health.

<ul><li> The Zombies are a good example of this in the Half-Life franchise. They may not be strong, but their toughness overall is rather high, except whenever it comes to shooting the Headcrabs off of them, which is a close enough weakness that Zombies normally have in common in various media.

<ul><li> For the Meat Shield version, a Heavy Weapons Guy with Natascha equipped can be one of these. For the price of lower firepower, anyone caught by these bullets will get slowed down, resulting in anything between a minor annoyance to a complete death trap depending on the circumstances. Additionally, the Natascha negates 20% the damage taken when the Heavy is below 50% health. Add a Medic into the equation, constantly healing the Heavy from any damage he might pick up from a lucky shot, and you've got a solid wall.
</li><li> A heavy carrying the Fists of Steel and being healed by a Medic can be almost unkillable, but is reduced to melee attacks if he wants to keep the protection.
</li><li> Similarly, a Eyelander (or reskins) and Chargin' Targe wielding demoman being healed by a medic. The Charging' Targe providing resistance to fire and explosive damage and the eyelander healing the demoman and increasing his speed and health upon killing enemies. The downside is not being able to equip the stickybomb launcher, making him unable to lay traps and limiting his ability to kill enemies at range.
</li><li> Tanks in Mann Vs. Machine don't have any offensive capability other than inching towards your base carrying a bomb, but they take impressive amounts of punishment. To get the achievement for killing it withing 20 seconds of it spawning, the recommended method is <em>five wrangled sentries</em> pointed exclusively at the thing.
</li><li> Also in MvM, the Scout, oddly, becomes this, in the inverse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">his usual game role</a>. His scattergun is designed to handle one-on-one situations while up-close with the enemy, making it decidedly lackluster unless fully upgraded at beating back the hordes. But he's as fast as ever, faster still if upgraded properly, and unlike other classes, when he picks up money, his health increases, and can go above his limit. A particularly nimble scout can have something like 600 health. On top of that, many players swap out the pistol for the Mad Milk (which gives everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> on the splashed enemies) and the bat for the Fan-Of-War (which does almost no damage but lets everyone do more damage to attacked enemies), further reducing his offensive power in exchange for support and versatility.

They wield handguns alongside the shield, but cannot fire them accurately without moving the shield away from their face to aim. Therefore their offensive power is very poor outside of extreme close range, but they are also nigh-unkillable from the front without exceptional aim (to target the hand extended to hold their gun) or the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">explosives</a> or Smoke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">gas</a>. A melee attack, as well as being electrocuted by Bandit, will cause them to lower their shields momentarily, allowing a follow-up attack. Montagne, however, takes the cake, as he is a shield operator whose special ability allows him to extend his shield down and outwards, fully covering him from the front and sides at the cost of his ability to attack.

It has a weapon virtually useless against armor that has an extremely sluggish rotation rate. However it has extremely good armor that can withstand 5 packs of C4 being detonated at once (other vehicles are fully destroyed with 3) and can function as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">spawn point</a> for the entire team which allows it to indirectly take down Tanks just by getting the tank to focus on it while the endless spawning team mates focus on taking it down.

His only ranged attack has a cooldown and his strongest attack is a hard-to-aim charge (that also has a cooldown). But to make up for this, he has a ton of health (most of it being armor) and he can deploy a front-facing barrier that can absorb massive amounts of damage and is big enough cover any teammate that's behind him.

With the most HP of any champion (By comparison, most heroes only have around 2-3 thousand HP.) and packing a shield that can withstand even more, and you also have cards that allow you to boost his health even further. This is enough to withstand any ultimate bar the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Dragon Punch</a>, and even then Fernando's own ultimate will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">stop the Dragon Punch cold</a>
</li><li> Terminus' only ranged attack is a small energy blast that deals little damage on its own. However, in addition to having a minimum of 4000 health, he can project a field in front of himself that can soak up unlimited damage for a short timewhich actually gives him extra charges of his ranged attack for potentially devastating (but still uncommon and reliant on enemies shooting at him when the power is active) damage bursts.

</p><ul><li> Tanks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> avert the trope, often ending up at or near the top of the damage dealing for their group. This is because, in World of Warcraft, much of a tank's threat generation is caused by damage output, and the tank often spends most of the fight attacking multiple enemies with close-range area-effect attacks to hold threat.
</li><li> The tanking classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em>, which include paladins, shadow knights, and warriors, play this trope straight. While the damage output of these classes is respectable, their primary focus is in holding the attention of the enemy. As such, their ability to deal damage is underplayed in favor of improving their damage-taking abilities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em>, one defensive choice for Tanker/Brute is Stone Armor. There's a power in that set called "Granite Armor", which turns you into a special character model (a living stone statue type of thing). While you have that active, you have somewhere between 15% and 25.2% Defense against all but Psionics, 37.5% and 63.7% damage reduction against all but Psionics, and high resistance to all status effects. The tradeoff is that you do 30% less damage, take three times longer to recharge across the board, run less than a third your normal speed and cannot jump.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> Due to the balancing factors present in the game's fitting system, any ship that is fitted for maximum defense is going to sacrifice maneuverability, speed, and damage output in order to achieve the most defensive ability. Some ships, such as the Drake, the Rokh, the Prophecy, and others are actually <em>designed</em> around the concept of surviving a fight by having a hard shell while only having moderate damage capabilities, while ships like the Dominix and the Armageddon, which can rely on remote drones to deal damage rather than their own weapons, can afford to dedicate more power and resources towards defensive modules. Some of these designs are even used as "bait ships" — ships that have tremendous damage-soaking ability in exchange for being ponderously slow and practically toothless, but still retaining the ability to warp-scramble attackers (thus keeping them from fleeing). Of course, the whole point is to trick a group into attacking your nigh-invulnerable ship, then calling in your friends to ambush them.
</li><li> The recent patch to Mining Barges and Exhumers has transformed several mining ships into Stone Walls. While all Exhumers grant a 5% bonus to shield resistances per level of Mining Barge skill (which you need to have maxed out just to fly an Exhumer), the Skiff takes it one step further by also adding a 5% bonus to Shield Hitpoints per level of Mining Barge. It also has more mid-slots than any other Exhumer, and since it only has to equip one mining laser, has the most extra CPU and Powergrid for fitting shield modules. This allows the Skiff to fit a buffer tank that can exceed 90,000 effective hitpoints. However, since it is a mining ship, it has poor handling and virtually no offensive capabilities other than drones.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Paragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>. Warriors are loaded with defensive skills, but their offense is at least halfway decent. Paragons, however, have armor that's on par with a warrior, can carry a shield for extra defense, and are absolutely packed with defensive skills and partywide defensive buffs. Killing a Paragon who knows what he's doing is an exercise in frustration. They aren't very dangerous though, and their offense is mildly annoying at best.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em>, the RAcaseal has the highest Defense, second-to-highest HP, and pretty high Evasion. The result of this is being a godly tank. However, their damage output is nothing to write home about.
</li><li> The Ice School in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101">Wizard101</a></em> is the only class that can equip gear with resistance to all attacks other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">crowns gear</a>. Even though later gear allows other schools to equip similar gear ice still has the best resistance. Also ice has the weakest attack spells and many defense-based spells and can even steal defensive charms and slow healing effects from enemies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">AceOnline</a> has the M-Gear. It shtick is stacking as much defense as it can to wither enemy attacks. A properly leveled M-Gear can hold off an attack by as many as <strong>thirty</strong> assailants at once without so much as breaking a sweat. Its crushing lack of attack power though, is more of an annoyance when level grinding, because enemy mobs give paltry amounts of EXP that killing many of them quickly is the only way to effectively level up.
</li><li> Among the tank jobs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, the Paladin exemplifies this idea. Compared to Warriors, Dark Knights, and Gunbreakers, their options for doling out damage are underwhelming. When it comes to sheer survival, however, the Paladin is hard to beat: they have very high defense in comparison to other tanks, and their skillset is centered around damage mitigation and staying alive long enough for their teammates to fell the enemy and win the fight.

<ul><li> The Tug is the toughest sloop-sized ship in the game by far, as it has 1110 HP, over twice as much as a Warsloop (550 HP) and over 3 times as much as the Torpedo Boat (350 HP), however, the Tug is also the poorest armed ship available to the Royal Navy, as it is only equipped with 1 medium gun and 2 light guns (which is even less than the Warsloop's 1 light and 4 medium guns), the Tug is also very slow for such a small ship, moving at only half the speed of a Torpedo Boat. Although the Tug lacks firepower and speed, it makes up for it in being the second cheapest ship available to the Royal Navy, costing only 30 Victory Points compared to their third cheapest ship, the Warsloop (which costs 40 Victory Points) and by the fact that the Tug's engines are powerful enough to tow a Weapon Barge, without much trouble, which can compensate for the Tug's lack of firepower.

They have an astonishing 1600 hitpoints, similar to a Town Hall structure, but attack slowly and for unimpressive damage. Their defenses can be boosted with Hardened Skin to reduce damage taken by 12 units, and Resistant Skin to mitigate spells cast upon them. Their "medium" armor-type is well rounded too resisting many damage types, and only receiving extra damage from "normal" attacks (most melee attacks). Their taunt move takes advantage of their colossal endurance by forcing enemies around them to target them instead of the more frail Nightelf units.

This gives them two chances to block any attack. In adventure mode, it is possible to wield hundreds of shield at a time, making the adventurer nearly impervious to attacks. Needless to say, though, shields aren't great for attacking with.
</li><li> One of the challenges in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>: Rebirth</em> turns you into one of these.

</p><ul><li> The Sentinel role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> is unable to directly attack enemies, but can taunt enemies to target them and possess exceptionally high defense and hit points.
</li><li> The Paladin class of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em> are this trope. Their attack is merely passable, but <em>ye God</em> is their defense high. Past level 45 they'll only take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> from physical attacks, and if you teach them the shield skill <em>Magic Mirror</em> they'll be completely immune to magical attacks, which means if you use their <em>Forbearance</em> ability— which takes damage for the entire party— your adventuring party is nigh-untouchable. Even before they learn all those high level abilities they're exceptionally useful since they learn the defense-boosting <em>Kabuff</em> spell and magic defense-boosting <em>Magic Barrier</em> spell at fairly low levels. They are defensive beasts.
</li><li> Many, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>, in varying degrees — not only between offense and defense, but the game's special and physical attack classifications.
<ul><li> Perhaps the most extreme example of this trope in the entire series is Shuckle, a Bug/Rock type Pokémon that not only has the highest Defense (tied with Mega Steelix and Mega Aggron) and Special Defense stats of out of any Pokémon in the game, but also sports some of the lowest HP, Attack, Special Attack, and Speed.
</li><li> The queen of the example belongs to Cresselia. Her HP is ridiculously high, with an amazing Defense and Special Defense stat to back her up as well as having access to several fantastic status moves, making it impossible for most Pokemon to take Cresselia down with just one hit, even if it deals super effective damage to her. However, her offensive stats are pretty underwhelming, especially for a Legendary Pokemon.
</li><li> Two good examples are Umbreon and Mandibuzz, which is unusual for Dark-types. Their Defense and Special Defense are incredibly high and they have very good HP as well, but their offensive stats are low. Both do learn Foul Play, a move that uses the target's Attack stat when dealing damage and have access to a wide variety of useful status moves.
</li><li> The best-known example is Blissey, who has absurdly high HP (with a maximum of 714 points, the game's highest) and Special Defense, as well as healing moves. The item Leftovers, which heals 1/16 of the holder's maximum HP each turn, is incredibly effective here, as well as the move Softboiled, which restores up to 50% of the user's maximum HP. Even with her abysmal Defense stat, Blissey's enormous HP allows her to take a few physical moves. And forget about status moves — not only can Blissey heal them with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy, her ability Natural Cure removes any status when she switches out. Finally, the moves Double Team and Minimize, which increase the user's evasion, can compound Blissey's defensive strategy by making her hard to hit in the first place. Her stellar defenses come at the cost of speed and damage with below-average Special Attack, bad Speed, and outright abysmal Physical Attack (which maxes out at 10, one of the lowest in the entire series).
</li><li> Wobbuffet has an absurdly high HP, but it cannot attack by itself. It has to rely on taking attacks and retaliates with either Counter and Mirror Coat. Since Wobbuffet has Shadow Tag, which prevents the opponent from switching out, it's very risky to attack it. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>, since no player could switch out and they couldn't attack. This was rectified in future generations so if two Pokémon with Shadow Tag were to face each other in battle, they can switch out freely.
</li><li> Aegislash in its Shield Forme possesses excellent defensive stats that even Legendary Pokemon may have a hard time dealing with it, along with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> King's Shield. Which not only blocks attacks, but also sharply lowers the target's Attack if it dares to make direct contact with it. Its offensive stats are pretty awful though, which isn't important as Aegislash can switch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Blade Forme</a> whenever it uses an attacking move.
</li><li> Bastiodon's defenses are both incredibly high, and its offensive stats are both very low, though it has access to one move that gives it some offensive capability, Metal Burst, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">counter-attacking</a> move. It does have two double weaknesses, to Fighting and Ground, but it has the ability Sturdy, meaning it can't be knocked out with one hit. It also gets bonus points for being a <em>literal</em> stone wall, having a castle wall for a face.
</li><li> Toxapex boasts an incredible base 152 Defense and 142 Special Defense, plenty of resistances due to its Water/Poison type, can heal itself at will or when it switches out, making it incredibly difficult to take out without relying on stat boosts (these can be removed with Haze however), can learn a move that boosts both its defenses, and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> that blocks attacks and poisons whatever makes direct contact, but its offenses are quite lacking. It does have an ability that guarantees critical hits on poisoned enemies, but even then it's not much of an offensive powerhouse.
</li><li> Pyukumuku has solid defenses with 130 on each side, and it can have an ability that ignores stat boosts, but it is completely incapable of attacking and is in a three-way tie for the slowest Pokémon in the series. Fortunately, it learns a few useful support and debuff moves to make it somewhat worthwhile, and it can heal itself.
</li><li> Cosmoem is a more extreme example, as its defenses are one point higher than Pyukumuku's, and it can buff itself with Cosmic Power and take advantage of Eviolite, but it can't do anything to an enemy <em>period</em> because it only learns three moves, all of which only affect itself.
</li><li> Lugia's offensive stats are lousy for a Legendary Pokémon, but it has high HP and Defense, and its Special Defense is massive even by Legendary standards. It also boasts two strong defensive abilities: its standard ability Pressure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn">increases the opponent's PP usage</a>, meaning they'll probably run out of moves before Lugia runs out of health, and its hidden ability Multiscale reduces the damage it takes at full health. Furthermore, it can heal easily using either Roost or Recover, and can Whirlwind enemies out of battle to remove stat boosts or enable switching again, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> against brute force.
</li><li> Rock and Steel type Pokémon are generally designed as impressive damage sponges. Normal attacks don't faze them as much as other types, they boast the greatest defences even if they don't hit like a Fire or Fighting type would in terms of raw power. Ice-types are also often designed as this, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere">they really shouldn't be</a> as the increased defenses don't quite make up for their mountain of weaknesses.
</li><li> Eviolite turns most Pokémon into this: it heavily boosts defensive stats, but it can only be used on a Pokémon that can evolve, meaning its attacking stats usually come out lackluster compared to its fully-evolved counterparts. The most favored Eviolite users are already Stone Walls to begin with, since they aren't losing much, including Dusclops and Chansey, who end up being better than Dusknoir and Blissey at their jobs.
</li><li> Rest/Talk, or giving a Pokémon Rest (puts it to sleep for three turns, removing status, and fully restores its health) and Sleep Talk (picks another random move while sleeping, fails if it picks Rest) tends to result in this. It sacrifices two moves that could be used for coverage, removes control, and adds a one-in-three chance of doing absolutely nothing while sleeping, but as long as the user can't be knocked out in three turns, they're basically immortal.

<ul><li> Gregorio is known as old Iron Wall, sporting a massive shield, although we never see him fight. His fleet sports high defense and is often more reserved when it comes to firing the cannons, saving up for ram attacks.
</li><li> Then there is the boss fight in Yafutoma where the player must fight against a literal turtle, which has a high defense count already but also has a special skill that renders all attacks down to 1HP damage and allows it to heal every turn. The only saving grace is that it can't attack in this form allowing you to focus on gaining SP to perform your own special attacks when his defense drops.
</li></ul></li><li> Estelle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> has the most staying power and worst killing power in the game. She has excellent Defense stats, she can cast healing magic, her Elemental Artes all add a defense buff of some sort, and she's the only playable character who thought to bring a shield. By contrast, Estelle's damage is outright terrible. Her attacks have a very short range, she has the game's lowest Strength stat, she can barely stagger enemies in a game where such a thing is crucial to survival, and her Mystic Arte is also the game's weakest among the party members.
</li></ul><ul><li> This is the default strategy for Peco in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em>. He has the highest natural HP and second highest natural Defense totals in the game, with average attack and low magic. Oh, and he recovers about 5% of his max HP every combat round. So he's already very difficult to kill, and most people will apprentice him to Fahl (who gives the best level up gains for, as you might guess, HP and Defense), making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>. The fact that Peco starts at level 1 and can therefore give himself the aforementioned level up gains right off the bat helps a lot.
</li><li> Though he's generally better off being played as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with a little less lightning, it is possible and in some cases advisable to play Paladin Cecil from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> as a shielding/turtling Stone Wall in the somewhat-more-customizable DS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a>. Start with his already excellent defense and HP stats, give him some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus Or Minus One Armor</a> (which generally only he can equip), and give him an ability set including Draw Attacks, HP+50%, and Brace. Draw Attacks means that every monster with a single-character-hit move will use it on him instead of the other, less-well-defended characters, HP+50% does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, and Brace reduces all incoming damage by 75%. For the remaining slot, you can stick him with White Magic, which allows him to cast buffs on himself and heal the damage the takes. As if this wasn't enough, you can also stick him in the back row, which will reduce his offensive output but will also even further increase his defense. Combine all of these, and Cecil is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>, which can be quite useful as that game can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, especially in the endgame or bonus areas. However, this build also severely reduces his ability to deal any damage, even with the best weapon in the game, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> Rydia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> Edge are more than capable of making up the difference.
</li></ul><ul><li> Sword-and-shield Warriors in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> series typically lean towards this, focusing on abilities that deflect damage rather than dish out the hurt.

</li><li> The Arcane Warrior class, a heavy-armor-wearing mage/tank hybrid. Their abilities allow them to either nullify or greatly reduce all damage, and they have access to any regular mage spell, such as heals and crowd control. If built correctly, they can resist all spells, as well. Add poultices into this for when mana gets low, and the Arcane Warrior can be nearly invincible. The only catch is their abilities use so much mana that all they can really do is auto-attack and occasionally heal, making battles take a long time.

<ul><li> The Protector class for the first two games. While their offense will sometimes be the weakest of the front row, most Protectors will simply laugh at hits that would have overkilled other characters a few levels higher than they. They have skills that further increase their/ally's defense, attract enemy attacks towards themselves, resurrect themselves automatically once per battle, take hits for other, squishier units, and nullify, to add insult to (non)injury, physical attacks.
</li><li> The third game has the Hoplite, which has a major focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">defense.</a> Most of their skill tree is dedicated to improving their ability to take hits, shield others, recover from damage or status effects, and even nullifying damage.

It is not uncommon to see Shadowmere trade blows with dragons without suffering any significant harm.

When combined with the Knight's ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield">Dual Wield</a> shields, a Templar can live through just about anything.
</li><li> Barik from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny">Tyranny</a></em> comes included with a set of <em>extremely</em> heavy armour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume">that's permanently stuck to him by the Edict of Storms</a>, is kitted out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">sword-and-board fighter</a> by default, and can learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">taunt moves that force enemies to attack him</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Ruler class resist every standard class (except Avengers, their counter class, and Berserkers, which hit everything hard), but in exchange don't get an advantage over anything but the vanishingly rare Moon Cancer class (and Berserkers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">which get hit hard by everything</a>). The quintessential example is Jeanne d'Arc, who boasts the highest HP in the game and adds a host of skills meant to reduce damage, but the third lowest ATK of the five-star Servants (outdone by many four-stars), a deck with only one Buster card in it, and almost no offensive tricks. Even her Noble Phantasm is nothing but defensive buffs, and when not upgraded, it stuns her after use. This makes her the absolute queen of stall teams, but near-useless if you want to finish a match quickly.
</li><li> Mash Kyrielight, as expected of someone whose class is called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Shielder</a>", fits this well. Her HP is high, she has tons of defensive abilities, including her Noble Phantasm, and her class gives her no weaknesses, meaning no enemies hit her effectively. However, it also gives her no enemies <em>she</em> can hit effectively, her ATK is kind of bad, and she lacks any self-damage-boosting skills, so her damage contribution is basically just going to be adding to the occasional Buster chain.
</li><li> Cu Chulainn, especially his original Lancer version, tends towards this playstyle. All three of Lancer Cu's skills are based on defense: he can dodge three attacks directed at him, he revives himself if his health hits 0, and he can cleanse himself of status effects while also healing himself. However, this obsessive focus on defense means that his damage is no better than a baseline silver Servant, aside from his Noble Phantasm having an instant-death effect (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">which rarely ever works</a>). Cu can feasibly solo some very hard bosses with the right setup... just don't expect him to do so quickly.

However, he cannot attack the main opponent or his/her partners when they are in front.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> V</em> has a few of these. Due to how it is possible to win a game peacefully, without going to war with other people, the stone walls in this game are very good for winning a peaceful victory while deterring anyone who tries to invade.
<ul><li> The Shoshone. All of their units get a 15% increase to combat power when fighting on friendly territory. Due to how all of their cities get an extra 8 land tiles around them the moment they're founded, the Shoshone have a lot of extra friendly territory to be more powerful on. On offense, though, it's mostly a long wait until you can pick up the Comanche riders.
</li><li> Morocco. When the game starts, they are usually placed within a desert, and if they stay in the desert, they are very hard to invade. They are able to build the Kasbah improvement on desert tiles instead of Forts. Unlike normal forts, which simply provide a 50% defense boost to units in them, the fact that they also provide boosts to gold, food, and production boosts transforms deserts from comparatively useless terrain to something that keeps Moroccan cities growing, while still having the 50% extra defense to units in them, so invaders have to go through them before they can get to the cities. Their special unit, the Berber Cavalry, which replaces the normal cavalry, only increases this, as they become more powerful when fighting in friendly deserts. Add in the fact that they're a trade-focused empire, meaning that invading them will likely cut out a big pile of money for you, and few people will invade Morocco... and for that same reason, Morocco's in no hurry to invade anyone else, because that would cut off their trade.
</li><li> Korea. It has two unique units that nobody else has access to. First is the Hwacha, a replacement for the Trebuchet that is about 62% more powerful than the Trebuchet, but lacks an offensive bonus against cities, making it excellent for defending but not that great at bombarding enemy cities. The other is the Turtle Ship, which replaces the Caravel. It has about 55% more combat strength than the Caravel, but it is unable to travel into deep oceans. Similar to the Hwacha, it is great for defending your own coastline, but not very good at going on the offensive.
</li><li> Ethiopia. If someone else has more cities than Ethiopia, all Ethiopian units get a 20% combat bonus against them. Their special unit, the Mehal Sefari, which replaces the Rifleman, only increases this, as it can get up to a 30% combat boost the closer it is to the capital. And these stack, giving Ethiopia up to a 50% combat bonus while defending, making them very hard for some big bully to take down. However, the very same bonuses that make them so strong defensively also make them suck on offense; the Mehal Sefari's boost stops working when travelling to attack far-off cities and, as Ethiopia conquers enemy cities, it will eventually have more cities than the enemy, thus disabling that other bonus too.
</li><li> Babylon. Its Unique Building, Walls of Babylon, provides a larger bonus to city strength and HP than normal Walls, but does nothing for offence. It also has the Bowman, a unique Archer with some added punch, who can then be stationed in a city to make it basically impregnable. Aside from that, though, Babylon's offensive potential is pretty much nil — however, its <em>real</em> focus is Science, meaning that after a few turns, Babylon's tech advantage will more than make up for its lack of special offensive units.
</li></ul></li><li> Push cards and Sgt. Blok in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Calculords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Calculords">Calculords</a></em>. Push units can push enemy advances back and usually have high HP, but little to no offensive power. This doesn't mean they aren't threatening, since any units pushed back to their base are destroyed automatically. Many push units also possess armor that protects them from damage below a certain threshold. A simple yet effective strategy is to fill a lane with push units (with an armored one at the front), and buff the lane's health and/or armor. Sgt. Blok is an enemy commander who makes extensive use of push cards, to the point of having very few attack cards in his deck; his advances an be hard to stop as he has plenty of armored troops to put at the front of a line.
</li><li> The Sentinel class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF">Wild ARMs XF</a></em>.

Waterbenders do not have the more typically aggressive offensive moves, instead focusing on redirecting their opponents' moves away from themselves, and most of their offense comes from their defense by turning their opponents' energy against them. In the context of the Hundred Years War, the Northern Water Tribe demonstrates this strategy as a whole. As Zhao pointed out, they were able to survive a hundred years of war as the landscape itself was an icy fortress. However, they lacked the ability or resources to mount any offensive campaigns against the Fire Nation. Notably, Iroh's defensive tactic to redirect lightning is inspired by waterbending tactics.

<ul><li> Although Stonewall Jackson himself doesn't really fit this trope, another American Civil War officer, George Henry Thomas, certainly does. Fighting for the Union, Thomas became known quickly as a great defensive general. The Battle of Chickamauga, where, after his superiors bungled their battle strategy and caused a disaster that lost the army (which was already outnumbered by 10,000 men) a full third of its strength, Thomas rallied the remaining troops into a stiff defensive position and fought off wave after wave of Confederate attacks. This gave Thomas his famous monicker "The Rock of Chickamauga". Later, his methodical mindset became an irritant with his superiors. General Grant once complained, "There is no better man to repel an attack than Thomas, but I fear he is too cautious to take the initiative. He wasn't so much cautious as methodical — you could maneuver around him fairly well, but you attacked him at your great peril.
</li><li> Chiselers in table tennis are players who solely play defense, whittling down their opponent's bodies or psyches. A famous match between two world-famous chiselers (Alex Ehrlich and Paneth Farcas) lasted two hours and twelve minutes before the very first point was scored, and that was because Farcas's arm had locked up. The referee had to be replaced part way through, as his neck began to lock up. The match led to table tennis receiving a time limit of twenty minutes.

It was slower and had offroad treads. It was used to deal with bunkers and fortified positions, supporting infantry as they pushed inland out of the beachheads during the initial stages of the Normandy invasion. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13zxkr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13zxkr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13zxkr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Jumbo actually was factory produced with the 76 mm gun, but many were given field refits of the 75 mm gun because it had a better high explosive round, making it superior to the 76 mm for that role. Most platoons kept at least one tank with a 76 mm gun for anti-tank combat. The 75 mm's armor piercing shell was also considered acceptable against most German tanks, it was only the Tigers and Panthers that were well-armored enough to need the increased penetration of the 76 mm gun.</span>
<ul><li> British tank doctrine during World War II had two main types of tank: "Cruiser" tanks, which operated as mechanized cavalry and often fell into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> territory, and "Infantry" tanks which, as the name suggests, were designed to provide support for infantry and were more centered around this dynamic. The Churchill tank had even more armor than the famous Tiger I and all but the biggest German guns had trouble disabling it, but its own main gun was rather underpowered and inadequate to deal with other armored threats, and it may have been slow, but due to its design being made it was slow <em>everywhere</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">able to traverse mud, trenches, hills, and other nasty terrain</a> that would've stumped most other tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> Switzerland has traditionally adopted this as its military style. They remain famously neutral, never going on offense — but to this day, it remains one of the most strongly fortified countries on earth. Their military capabilities are almost entirely focused on defending against invasion, so while they could never have invaded their neighbors, they've also remained uninvaded themselves — a claim their more powerful neighbors cannot make.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-2">The famous Il-2 Sturmovik<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was nicknamed the Flying Tank because it had steel armour protecting the cockpit, engine, fuel tanks and other vital parts from enemy AA-guns and a rear gunner to keep away enemy fighters. The payoff was that it had a much lower speed than lighter armoured single seat ground attack planes like the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Typhoon as well as a much smaller payload in bombs and rockets. Most attack planes since have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a> with few exceptions like the A-10 Warthog and the Su 25 Frogfoot.
</li><li> The real life military tactic of the Shield Wall was essentially this. Soldiers would form a line where their large shields either touching or overlapped, extend their spears, and wait. Trying to go on the offense with an intact shield wall was slow and difficult, because everyone would have to move at the same pace, which could be tripped up by differing terrain, or someone getting tired and not being able to hold up the heavy and cumbersome shield for defense. Trying to attack a shield wall was a daunting task without overwhelming numbers, however, because while simply standing with a raised spear or making a short stab with a sword isn't very impressive offense, it's very good at keeping the men in the shield wall protected while the attackers either die or wear themselves out trying to breach it. As such it was the backbone of the Greek phalanx, the Roman legions, and continued in use all the way to the late Middle Ages.
</li><li> There is also the power of literal stone walls. Fortifications made out of stone by themselves have no means of attack and are completely immobile but the wall created a tall barrier that the enemy either has to find some way over, under or through to get into the city/keep that lays behind the wall. Since attacking a fortification before the invention of cannons was such a daunting prospect, one common tactic when faced with a stone fortification was to surround it and wait till the defenders starve to death.
</li><li> The <em>crupellarius</em> gladiator type was distinguished by a primitive plate armor stronger than even the standard battle dress of the era. In one slave rebellion, Roman soldiers confronted by <em>crupellarii</em> found their swords so ineffective that they had to break out pickaxes and hatchets to do any damage. However, the armor was heavy and ungainly, and the gladiators in question were fighting in the hot Italian sun, meaning that <em>crupellarii</em> had to be very cautious and conservative when moving and attacking or risk heat stroke.
</li><li> In World War 1, the "female" varients of the British Mark tanks fits this bill. The female variants had just as much armor and were as slow as the male variants. The male variants had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhallicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhallicWeapon">large cannons</a>, the female varients were only equipped with machine guns. This made them great against infantry but left them with no offensive capability against even lightly armored positions. In the first tank battle of the war (as well as the first one in world history), a pair of female Mark 1s were unable to do anything against a German tank.
