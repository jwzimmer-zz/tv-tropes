<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>, the former "Fool King" of Immanity had challenged the Warbeast race eight times to a game, betting large portions of territory despite the kingdom's resources being nearly spent. While most of the territory was useless with his people's existing technology, this still ended with eight losses that cost his people the majority of their territory and left them with nothing but a single city remaining. However, while this appeared to be a fool act that hastened the demise of the human race, the truth is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the king knew the kingdom's resources were running out fast and that he personally had little chance to defeat any of the other races, so he challenged the Warbeasts who required contestants to have their memories erased in order to prevent loss on their part, used his resources and apparent weakness to convince them to play with the decreased cost of not telling anyone as long as he lived, and then worked around this pledge by sealing his knowledge in a book to be opened by the next king. Then, instead of passing the crown to his daughter, he arranged it that the next king would be chosen by a series of contests. In this way, he gave his race a fighting chance, ensuring that the knowledge he'd accumulated would be in the hands of a talented successor capable of using it to challenge the Warbeasts and win.</span>

So long as a single human soul exists within it, it will stand as eternal proof that Humanity existed, even when the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are all long gone. That's rather hopeful for a series well known for its terrifying imagery.
<ul><li> Evangelion's backstory is expanded upon from the various official materials and videogame adaptations, revealing things that are only vaguely hinted at in the series itself. This trope is the origin of both the Angels and mankind, having been created when an ancestral alien species sent out progenitor beings (dubbed "Seeds of Life") billions of years in the past to different planets to seed intelligent life. The conflict in the series originated because two Seeds of Life landed on Earth by accident, creating two separate and different forms of "human" life - the Angels and humanity.

They suspected that Frieza was up to something when he recalled all the Saiyans to their home planet and knew that they couldn't leave since the scouters would sense them.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>, it's implied that Zor sent his battlefortress to Earth for this, so someone that weren't either the tyrannical Robotech Masters or the now crazed Invid would hold the secrets of Robotechnology and the power source behind it and not misuse it. Sadly, the Masters' troops tracked his ship down before their fuel could run out...

He and his fellow survivors establish a community that lasts into the story's present day, 3,700 years later. He devises stories designed primarily to teach his descendants to survive in the stone world. However, the 100 Tales Byakuya created also serve another purpose.

<ul><li> Before becoming a sun (and thus effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">killing herself for her people's survival</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Xadhoom</a> recorded a copy of her mind and immense knowledge. At first it seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">subverted</a>, as she also asked her storyteller father to send one last Evronian to steal the recording so her recorded mind would kill him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">giving him the key of her power but not the key to SURVIVE her power</a>...

Also, Paperinik now has the recording, and last said recording is seen he says he wants to give Xadhoom's mind a new body...
</li><li> When Xerba was conquered by the Evronians, the Xerbians were able to launch three colony ships. <em>Xabra</em> was shot down immediately, and <em>Xenia</em> escaped to establish a colony, but the flagship <em>Antra</em> went straight to Earth to warn us about the Evronians, so that our primitive but more militaristic race would be able to use their advanced technology (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill">that the Evronians had to trick their way around, as Xerba's orbital defences were too much for them and they knew</a>) and their data on the Evronian military to repel the eventual invasion, and possibly ultimately take them down. Sadly, they're caught between the Evronian fleet that had invaded Xerba and the one <em>already</em> preparing the invasion of Earth, and by the time the <em>Antra</em> is discovered by Paperinik <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ship is orbiting Saturn completely lifeless, save for a crazed defence droid that is trying to recreate a crew to protect</span>.
<ul><li> Xarion, a high-ranking Xerbian government officer who was on the <em>Antra</em>, manages to escape with a copy of the database to try and reach Earth anyway, but finds himself with an Evronian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> on his escape pod. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He manages to push the Evronian out and get to Earth, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">his use of an Evronian tracker gets him mistaken for an Evronian by Paperinik and the database is destroyed in the ensuing fight</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Evronians</em> did it too: after Xadhoom wiped out large parts of their military, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship">their mobile homeworld</a>, their emperor and most of the Imperial Council, a group of survivors dispatched to Earth Grrodon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeShifting">Voluntary Shape Shifting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>, to prepare the planet for an invasion.

</li><li> Again from the Evronians: as Xadhoom was destroying their mobile homeworld some members of the Scientific Caste, led by a cyborg called "Wise Among Us", took off with a colony ship to build a new Evronian nation, apparently on different principles from the Evronian Empire (they actually had two, but Xadhoom stole the other to escape with Paperinik, the surviving Xerbians and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">the former Coolflames</a>, and found there the equipment to copy her mind).

<ul><li> This requires a little bit more clarification. There are actually three timelines involved. The original timeline <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sent a device to convince Christopher Columbus to travel to the New World instead of leading a final, victorious crusade to capture Jerusalem for Christianity</span> creating the second timeline.

The people of the 15th century wouldn't be able to understand what was going on, so the time travelers had their timeline's history etched directly onto their skulls so that future archaeologists could find it and know the sacrifices that they had made.</span>
<ul><li> What was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">etched on the metal plates in the skulls were directions to discovering the archived knowledge from the second timeline.

</li></ul></li><li> There was a short story called <em>Last Contact</em> where the Big Rip happens much earlier than expected, and there's a throwaway line about how they're discovering new alien stars daily, because those aliens are doing very noisy artificial things (like throwing a huge pile of exotic atoms into their sun) simply as a "The universe is ending, but I'm here!" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or as one of the human characters put it "they were saying goodbye". At the end, there was a device which had been designed by humans to record data about the Rip, in the hope that some of it <em>might</em> survive and <em>might</em> be found by and be of use to a hypothetical race in the next universe.</span>
</li><li> This is the direct origin story of one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a></em>. A highly advanced species faced with a slow decline into extinction embarks on a long-term project to send all of their accumulated knowledge out into the universe in a self-sustaining "Prior Wave". It takes long years and much difficulty until the wave is finally <em>sent</em>, and it travels through the universe for rather longer, touching the ancestors of at least one known civilization along the way...until it gets absorbed, purely by chance, by a cloud of cosmic dust that is going to collapse and form a solar system. Fast forward to the actual formation of the planets, and one of them in the new star's habitable zone is featuring a super-intelligent crystal shell englobing much of it (and eventually its atmosphere) — the future Empress of Therm. (A poignant scene shows how the last survivors of an expedition launched by the Empress much later, after intelligent organic life has finally evolved on her world and she's gone about building the actual empire she takes her name from, <em>discover</em> that planet of origin...a dead world with no signs of the original civilization left at all. Even the ruins have long since crumbled into dust.)
</li><li> A version of this trope, less dire when it was enacted, happened in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>. Alderaan's pacifism is mentioned to be a relatively new development. When it became global, some of their weaponry was auctioned off, some was melted down and repurposed... and two warships were set aside, computer-controlled and kept in local space. The Rebellion found one not long after the world was destroyed.

</li><li> An unintentional example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy">The History of the Galaxy</a></em>.

Three of the ancient races in the region manage to save themselves by hiding inside a globular star cluster and using powerful gravity generators to cloak it from outside view (the gravity generators kept light from escaping the cluster; thus the Forerunners couldn't see it). A race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Fish People</a> called Delphons chose to stay and fight. Their only means of fighting the Forerunners was their own stars, which they used as beacons to attract the swarm and then set off a nova reaction. By the time the swarm was destroyed, the Delphons were extinct. Three million years later, a human archaeological team finds a group of frozen Delphons and several inactive Forerunners. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> downloads the memories of one of the dead Delphons and puts them into the brain of a human soldier.

<ul><li> One of the memories experienced by the soldier has him looking at a hominid, implying that the Delphons had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">colony on Earth</a> and pulled a species-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to allow younger races to evolve.

It affected <em>Picard</em> and no other crew member. The life he lived involved getting married, having a family, and other things he's never made time for - taking it from a disturbing experience to something he sees as a gift.
</li><li> The episode "The Chase" reveals that all humanoid life is this—a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursor</a> species that inhabited the Milky Way eons before life anywhere else was more complex than bacteria seeded planets all over the galaxy with DNA so that evolution there would result in people who resembled them after their eventual extinction.

</li><li> A version in <em>Voyager</em>'s "Fury" where Kes returns, determined to punish the crew for taking her from her homeworld, which results in her becoming a super-powered outcast at the end of her lifespan (Ocampans live for 9 years). She uses the ship's warp core to make herself appear younger and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travels</a> into the past. Her scheme is foiled, and she is killed. Determined to break the loop, Janeway has the Kes of the past record a message for herself. When the loop comes around again and Kes once again boards the ship, Janeway plays the message to her, convincing her to stop.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a hyper-advanced ancient race created an octonary star system (a system with eight suns), something that doesn't occur in nature, so anyone would be curious and come look, and placed a warning on the system's only planet Aia. Anyone touching the artifact receives the Admonition, a data dump of visions showing the destruction of entire civilizations due to the rise of synthetic life forms and the coming of "the Destroyer". Centuries ago, a group of Romulans happened upon the planet and learned the awful truth. Those who did not go mad or kill themselves from the visions formed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Zhat Vash</a> with the goal of preventing the apocalypse by ensuring that synthetic life is never created</span>.

It gave them the gate coordinates from which the Goa'uld launched their attack. Unfortunately this SGC never learned how to speak Goa'uld and the warning went untranslated until a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">quantum mirror</a> landed the prime universe's Daniel Jackson in that one.

</li><li> Then they did it <em>again</em> with the Asgard.

The episode shows that what we've always assumed was the original timeline was actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>. Originally, the Atlantis expedition arrived from Earth and found the city with only enough power to turn on the lights. The shield failed and the city started to flood, killing most of the population. One character managed to accidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> 10,000 years into the past. She devised a plan to modify the city's power supply to keep it operational for 10,000 years, so that when the team we'd always seen finally arrived ("again"), the city had enough power to maintain the shield and rise to the surface of the ocean when the shield finally did fall. The plan required her to go into stasis and wake up every 3,300 years to maintain the system, so that when she was finally awoken for good, she was in an alternate present.

<ul><li> In "The Music of the Spheres", the world is bombarded by alien broadcasts that anyone under the age of 21 or so believe to be the most beautiful music they've ever heard. When the broadcasts prove addictive and cause those who listen to them to mutate, the world governments declare martial law, until scientists succeed in decoding the message. The signals originated on a world whose sun had turned ultraviolet 40 years ago. The signal warned that Earth's sun was about to undergo a similar change, and that the broadcasts would genetically alter those who heard them into a new golden-skinned form that could survive under the new sun. Fortunately, it had a rare good ending with no twist involved: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the powers that be actually realize the importance of letting that music play, specifically rebroadcast it across the world, including using mobile vehicles to get the sound out to third world countries and to the non-human life on the planet, and in the end, it's insinuated humanity will be just fine. Even those who are too old/decide not to mutate will live... indoors and underground.</span>
</li><li> In "Origin Of Species," a group of students is brought to the future <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where they find that humanity, in the interim, got heavily into genetic manipulation, basically dooming the human race.

Samuel Colt, yes that Samuel Colt, sends the ashes to them via Western Union with instructions to wait like 100 years so that they get them in the present.

Rahl himself is killed by his son Nicolas, who becomes an even greater tyrant. Fortunately, there is a backup plan. Shota manages to survive this long and lets Richard know what to do.

Then Walternate kills his wife Olivia and plots to speed up this world's destruction as revenge for letting his world die. Walter realizes that the only way to prevent this is to somehow send a vision to Peter in the past and tells Peter that this might just be exactly what he's experiencing right now. He's right.

But after facing defeat at the hands of a trans-planar rebellion (not that there's much to fight over at this point), the Illithids sacrificed unbelievable numbers of their Elder Brains to create a psionic maelstrom that sent the surviving members of their race into the distant past - that is, shortly before the <em>D&amp;D</em> setting. This way they can get a head start on forging their empire while avoiding that pesky slave uprising altogether. It also explains their tremendous egos; after all, they <em>know</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">their victory is inevitable</a>.

Different factions viewed it in their own way. Some wanted more resources, others wanted to protect the new world from human influence, yet others just wanted to be there for any fighting that took place. It was only after they got to Pandora that they discovered that the state of Earth isn't the same as when they left. The AIs have kicked all the humans into orbit and seem to be in the process of doing something unclear to Earth. Tectonic activity is mentioned.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Prothean</a> scientists used an experimental one-way Mass Relay to travel to the Citadel and block the Reapers' primary route into the galaxy, in the hopes that it would give the <em>next</em> advanced species that would arise - some 50,000 years down the road - a chance at stopping the Reapers' cyclical extermination of sentient life. It's all the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker">tearjerking</a> when you realize that they had departed from a hidden sanctuary world where they had been held in stasis as the galaxy burned around them, after the managing AI had switched off life support to all the other colonists to preserve their lives, as they were classed "critical personnel".
<ul><li> Also, the beacon from the beginning of the game served a similar purpose, though it wasn't entirely intentional. The Protheans left on Illos sent out a signal once they thought the Reapers were gone, just in case there was someone, or anyone, out there to receive it, so they could know they weren't alone.
<ul><li> It's not a coincidence "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7bE3hUwylQ">Vigil's Theme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is the menu music for <em>Mass Effect</em>.

<ul><li> Also from ME3, we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Crucible, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superweapon">superweapon</a> designed to fight the Reapers by one cycle, and left for the next to find. That cycle found it, but was unable to complete it, so they documented what design changes they could, and hid it for the <em>next</em> generation, passing it on and on, through the ages, always hoping that the next might be able to finish their work. Every reiteration of the Crucible brought it closer to completion, and each cycle that failed to complete it ensured that the knowledge was left for the next. It's even mentioned that the Crucible was extremely simple in design, ensuring that the next cycle would be able to translate it with the limited knowledge they would find in the ruins of the cycle that came before it. Oddly enough the knowledge of what it actually <em>does</em> or how it works was lost long ago; every cycle just knows that it was something the previous cycle tried but never finished.</span>
</li><li> We also have Javik, the last Prothean. A soldier during the last days of the Prothean Empire, whose plan was to go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryosleep</a> with hundreds of thousands of others, so that they could rebuild the empire after the Reapers left for dark space again. Unfortunately, several Protheans on the colony end up indoctrinated and sabotage the defenses. When Javik is about to be frozen, the facility's VI called Victory informs him that there's not enough power for all the occupied pods to last long enough, and what's worse: automated unfreeze is no longer an option due to damage. Following its programming, Victory shuts off all the pods but Javik's despite the latter's protests. Victory tells Javik to tell future races of the Protheans. However, Javik has other plans - he will be an avatar of vengeance against the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reapers</span>.
</li><li> Invoked by Garrus after recruting Javik, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumour">half-seriously</a> suggests that if they ever come close to losing the War, they should take a leaf out of the Prothean's book and put Shepard on ice, ready for Round Two in 50,000 years.
</li><li> Additionally, there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the VI Vendetta</span> left behind on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thessia</span> by the Protheans to aid the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">asari</span> in becoming the dominant species in the next cycle.

Unknown to him and the Scourge though, the Red Dragonflight saved a portion of the Sunwell's power. They made this power (presumably with the help of the Blue Dragonflight) into a human girl named Anveena Teague. The romantic subplot comes in because the blue dragon Kalecgos is the one sent to fetch Anveena, and along the way they have adventures and fall in love. In the last raid of the Burning Crusade expansion (called the Sunwell Plateau), Anveena has to "die" (more like dissolve though, as she wasn't properly alive in the first place) so that the Sunwell can be reignited.</span> A literal example of flinging a light into the future.

While their empire was crushed centuries prior, they at some point managed to produce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality warping book</a> that alters history the more it is written. When placed near any material that can be used to write with (though human blood seems to produce the greatest additions), it will absorb said material and add new sections that further detail the Daevites' history. What were formally utter defeats only become setbacks, and previously unmentioned survivors of battles will be revealed to have split off and rebuilt the Daevite civilization. While the book currently puts the Daevites as having been overthrown by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> during his early conquests, it leaves the fates of many high-ranking persons ambiguous, and further additions to the text would likely describe them as having resettled elsewhere and continued their empire. Should the account ever catch up to modern day (or at least within several centuries of it), it would likely alter history to such a point that the world as a whole would be substantially transformed for the worse. On top of all this, the book in-possession of the Foundation appears to not be the only surviving record, as there have been noticeable additions to it several times when it was nowhere near any inking substances.

<ul><li> That said, some people may actually implement parts of it, in the event something of that magnitude happens: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Terminal_Event_Management_Policy#Seriously_should_this_be_considered.3F">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel">The History Channel</a>'s 'Life After People' Mount Rushmore will probably remain recognizable long enough for other species to develop sapience and recognize it as an unnatural structure.

<ul><li> According to the show, the longest-lasting element of human civilization will be probes sent into deep space, and the instruments left on the moon, where the lack of atmosphere (and thus erosion) will preserve them much longer than anywhere on Earth. Asteroid and micrometeorite impacts will eventually destroy the moon instruments, while the probes will suffer a similar fate from interstellar dust, though at an even slower rate.
</li></ul></li><li> As an inversion of sorts, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant">Waste Isolation Pilot Plant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> project is struggling to find a way to <a class="urllink" href="http://downlode.org/Etext/WIPP/">inform future generations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> not to mess with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">our</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">radioactive waste</a>.

</li><li> Several cases during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Most of them, with the exception of the first example are more of hoping that their allies will rescue them in the future, rather than just sending the light off to help others.
<ul><li> Several inmates at Nazi concentration camps wrote and buried diaries to let the world know what happened.
<ul><li> The history and life of the Warsaw Ghetto was extensively documented by Jewish scholars and buried. Most but not all of the document caches have been recovered.
</li></ul></li><li> As Poland fell, they sent off to the UK their work on breaking the German codes. This has been portrayed as a dying man flinging his sword to his ally, so they can continue the fight.
</li><li> When Vichy France was invaded, all the French warships stationed at Toulon were sunk by their crew to prevent their capture by the Nazis. All except for the submarine Casabianca, which escaped the harbor to fight for the allies. In order for this to happen, dock crews had to risk their lives by helping and the other submarines of the fleet had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice themselves to draw fire</a>. They did this under the promise that Casabianca make her survival count.
</li><li> When Italy signed the armistice with the Allies, Supermarina (the naval command) and the smartest parts of the government, knowing that the Germans would have fought on anyway with the help of the remaining troops loyal to Mussolini, sent many troops to the mountains and the Allies-occupied zones in the south and most of the fleet to Malta, ready to fight to take back the country and, for the troops in the mountains, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">make hell for the former allies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">the Fascists</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation#Projects">The Long Now Foundation's projects<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are about this. They include a clock to run for ten millenia and an effort to preserve languages that are likely to become extinct.
</li><li> Some high schools have buried time capsules, where they get a container, fill it with stuff from their year and bury it. Decades later, at a school reunion or something, they dig it up and see what everyone put in there to reminisce about their teen years.
</li><li> From the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> poem <em>In Flanders Fields</em>:
<div class="indent">Take up our quarrel with the foe: / To you from failing hands we throw / The torch; be yours to hold it high.
</div><ul><li> Except the failing hands aren't passing the sword to continue fighting, the failure was that they did not keep the peace. The 'we' is both sides of the conflict  passing the idea and hope for peace to future generations. The torch is for peace.
</li></ul></li><li> A total of five space probes have been sent out, or are on their way out, of the solar system (Pioneers 10 and 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, and New Horizons). On them contains information about both the location in space, as well as <em>when</em>, they originate from. A number of scientists think that they may one day be picked up by some other intelligence and will tell them we were here, once. Although, others hypothesize that <em>we</em> may end up recovering them in the future as museum pieces to early space exploration.
</li><li> On a smaller scale, this is the purpose of reproduction. Every living organism eventually dies. Its genetic material and heritage is carried by its offspring.
</li><li> This is (part of) the idea behind protected archives like the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarastollen_underground_archive">Barbarastollen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or "Zentraler Bergungsort der Bundesrepublik" (central retrieval site of the federal republic of Germany). The storage location is covered by more than 200 meters of granite.
</li><li> Another small-scale example: One reason pilots (and especially test pilots of experimental aircraft) are trained to deliver all information in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan">Danger Deadpan</a> is so that they can give a clear picture of what's going on with their craft even when disaster strikes, as it might save the lives of future pilots, crew, and passengers by allowing others to find and fix the faults that caused the accident.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KEO">The KEO probe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, at least assuming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">it ever gets off the drawing board</a> (the idea was first conceived in 1994, and construction/launch have been pushed back <em>six times</em> since then).
</li><li> This is the exact definition of and reason why art and culture are made. Humans crystallise little pieces of their own souls in their artistic creations and fling them out into the world so that something of themselves will live on when they are gone.
<ul><li> Speaking of art, one of the last things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoyOfPainting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoyOfPainting">Bob Ross</a> did before dying of lymphoma was to certify other people to teach his painting style so the world would always have some happy little trees.
</li></ul></li><li> On the more "Ominous Warning" end of the scale, nuclear waste is stored in massive, underground tombs. Future civilizations may (logically) assume that they are actually tombs of beloved individuals or reliquaries. To warn them of the danger, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/">we intend to leave a simple message<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
