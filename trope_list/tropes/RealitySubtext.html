The Morse code messages the father sends them from his ship when he tells them he's not coming home yet — "I'm sorry and I love you" — are thus meant for Miyazaki's family.
</li><li> The story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em> was based closely on the experiences of the writer, Nosaka Akiyuki, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.

</li><li> The author of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">Light Novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a>!</em> (a black comedy slice-of-life show about a hikikomori) is an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a>, and even admitted in one of his author's notes that he's been living off the royalties of the book and delaying his work on other novels. Also, the dub of the anime based on the book cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPatton">Chris Patton</a> as the lead character. Patton has admitted to having anxiety issues (including a time in high school where he refused to leave his room). It's hard to tell if this influenced his casting or not, but it certainly helped inform his acting—his work in the show has ended up being one of his most critically praised roles in anime dubbing.
</li><li> Takotsuboya, known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">Dark Fic</a> doujins, comes from a background of soul-crushing tragedy of failure after failure as he wanted to become a mangaka but failed in his dreams completely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> parallels director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">real-life battle with depression</a> (hence mental illness being such a major theme of the show), as well as his growing distaste for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a> culture. The infamous masturbation scene from <em>End of Evangelion</em> is often cited as an especially blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">middle finger aimed at the audience</a>.
<ul><li> Likewise, Anno later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorRecovery">recovered</a> and eventually entered into a happy marriage. It's widely believed that his new lease on life was responsible for the comparatively upbeat and optimistic tone of the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movies. Shortly thereafter, his mental health plummeted once again for the third movie...and, this being Anno, this too is evident in the movie.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em>:
<ul><li> One can feel the influence of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the 2011 great earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan</span> on certain parts of the film. It's no coincidence that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> at the last part is 5 years <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at least from Taki's perspective</span>, just like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">5 years passed between the great earthquake in 2011 and the film's release in 2016.</span>
</li><li> Mitsuha's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallTownBoredom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallTownBoredom">Small Town Boredom</a> and desire to move to Tokyo reflect the gradual dying-off of rural Japan as their young move away to urban areas.
</li><li> The novelization has an exclusive scene where, after the Shinto ritual, Mitsuha and Yotsuha have to entertain some guests and they note afterward that the party was full of elderly, most likely a jab at the silver tsunami Japan's facing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen">Barefoot Gen</a></em> is basically an adaptation of Keiji Nakazawa's life in Hiroshima before, during and after the atomic bombing as he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> Gen were raised in a house of outspoken and ostracized pacifists and both of them lost nearly all their family members from his burning house except for his mother, elder brothers, and infant sister who died from malnutrition stemming from food shortages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheComiq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheComiq">The Comiq</a></em> has an in-universe example, as Ryota's work has parallels to murders that took place three years ago, specifically a symbol found at the scene of the crime. The backgrounds turn out to be drawn by the supposed murderer, who is actually innocent and seeking a way to clear his name.

<ul><li> According to the introduction to the Fleischer/Aparo <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a></em> trade, the only reason the Spectre was revived as a character at all was that then-DC editor Joe Orlando was mugged and the thief got away. This left him longing for a superhero who punished the wicked after every legal recourse has failed. A little research into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a> later, he found some early Spectre stories that were just up that alley, and voila.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ShangChi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ShangChi">Shang-Chi</a> was initially created as the son of the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Yellow Peril</a> villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu">Fu Manchu</a>. Since Marvel lost the rights to Fu Manchu in the ensuing decades, whenever Shang-Chi's father appears, he's never referred to by name. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a></em>, where T'Challa tries to speak Fu's name, only to be cut off before he can say it.
</li><li> The marriage of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a></em> characters Scott Free and Big Barda is based on that of their creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>, and his wife Roz to whom he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> for fifty years.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> miniseries <em>Shattered Image</em> was intended to be a reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, where the characters from the various studios making up Image would be briefly shunted off into separate universes, then joined back together, mostly. The original notion was that the Silvestri characters would get their own 'verse, while the Liefeld characters would stay part of the whole. Instead, due to real-world machinations, the Liefeld characters vanish without anyone noticing partway through the series (replaced by similar heroes from other 'verses), and the Silvestri characters leave in a solemn parting scene, then return suddenly in the very last panel.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Captain Marvel</a> and Superman see each other, they usually end up throwing punches, much more often than is typical for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">Let's You and Him Fight</a>. This is largely a nod to their very first battle <em>in court</em>. DC Comics sued Fawcett over Captain Marvel being too similar to the Man of Steel, and eventually got the book canceled. Comic writers have since explored this situation decades later by having the two of them fight one another in the panels.

</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, James Robinson's final issue of the series (and the last issue of <em>Justice League of America</em> before the 2011 reboot) was very obviously a bitter commentary on the behind the scenes issues of the series itself. In the issue, Dick Grayson and Donna Troy lament that nobody will remember their League, but that they're proud of the work they did, and that they will never forget it. This incarnation of the team was going to be rebooted out of continuity, along with all of the team's members aside from Dick himself, who Robinson also commented on regarding his return to the Nightwing role after being Batman for a few years.

Tragically, though, Mike suffered from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">sudden heart attack</a> in the middle of drawing the book, having finished seven pages. His friends and coworkers then collaborated with the Hero Initiative to finish the book while receiving VERY little pay (sometimes as little as a dollar per page), and released the complete story as a tribute to him.

Meaning that established supporting characters such as Kate Cushing were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, with their fates in doubt. Peter Parker himself, who had only recently returned to New York City with the promise of a permanent staff position, was among those fired and faced an unstable future. The story reportedly served as a way for DeFalco to work "through his feelings" concerning the ongoing financial difficulties of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> and a series of Marvel staff layoffs. Some were staffers which DeFalco himself had hired for Marvel, and he felt partly responsible for the company letting them go like this. Per "The Life of Reilly": "In his Daily Bugle scenes, Tom D. worked in a lot of in-jokes and references to what was going on at Marvel, all of which probably went over the heads of people on the outside, but were glaring obvious to anyone who was working (or had been working) at the company."

It is the story of an immortal man who is tired of his long life and seeks death. He describes himself as "tired, and old and lonely". The story is considered to express the 65-year-old Bark's own feelings of fatigue and decision to end a whole era of his life.

The two characters had strikingly similar origin stories, and many comic historians have commented that Druid was likely a precursor of sorts to Strange. Many years later, <em>Avengers Spotlight</em> #37 revealed that Doctor Druid and Doctor Strange had actually been empowered by the same man, the Ancient One, and that Druid had essentially been used as a guinea pig to make sure that it would be safe for the Ancient One to make Strange the new Sorcerer Supreme:

The tears in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>'s eyes are real - Spencer Tracy was dying, and she and Tracy had been together for twenty-five years.

It's essential to the plot because it means the aliens don't think to steal his basketball skills and this incident, in turn, leads to him returning to basketball which he also did in real life, making this a sort-of fictional autobiographical account. They even go so far as to acknowledge in-film that Jordan is a subpar baseball player and is only being indulged because of his celebrity.

Han's flustered efforts to bluff his way through the exchange ("Uh... Everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you... How are you?") are all the more believable because Ford neglected to memorize his lines for that scene, and actually <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">improvising as he went along</a>. Han's wincing expression at the end of that monologue (as if to say "They couldn't <em>possibly</em> have bought that...") was actually Ford's expression, as he was absolutely sure that he'd screwed up that take.

<ul><li> It is believed that following 9/11, an entire scene was cut from the first film where Spidey strings a huge web in between the World Trade towers. There was a trailer composed of this scene (which was, obviously, pulled after the attacks), but whether this scene was from the movie or created specifically for the trailer is less certain.

The movie was made by Trey Parker shortly after he found out his fiancee Liane had cheated on him.
</li><li> The Oracle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> had to be played by a different actor during the last movie, as the previous actor died from complications of diabetes.

</li><li> Both the first and last <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky">Rocky</a></em> films mirror <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>'s story of making them quite movingly.

Then when Stallone tried to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em>, it was at a time when he was a laughing stock after several poor career moves, and no one thought the film could be anything but a disaster. Yet when the film was released, the fans all trumpeted it as a worthy conclusion to the story.
<ul><li> This trope was further emphasized with the spin-off film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed">Creed</a></em>, which focuses on Adonis, the son of Apollo Creed, trying to become a boxer in his own right with the aid of Rocky's training. The film was the first in the series that Stallone neither wrote nor directed, and it essentially allowed him to pass the torch to Ryan Coogler and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBJordan">Michael B.

Notably, it was made in 2018, during a period of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">renewed tension</a> between the United States and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin">Vladimir Putin</a>'s Russia.

When Smith agreed to let Mewes reprise his role in <em>Clerks II</em> in 2006, he did it on the condition that Mewes stay clean. Considering Smith had actually forced Mewes into rehab himself at least once before, and he had earlier refused to cast him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerseyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerseyGirl">Jersey Girl</a></em> because of his drug problems, he understood the significance of making Jay an ex-drug user all too well.

The film, released in 1991, bluntly parallels the ending of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> as tensions between the United States (the Federation) and the Soviet Union (Klingons) had subsided partially due to the potential damage done to Russia, one of the world's greatest superpowers, after the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 (the destruction of Praxis).

<ul><li> The film can also be seen as an example of a once-good government taking increasingly dark and amoral actions in the name of protecting its citizens from a perceived outside threat, a subject that is very relevant to the post-9/11 western world.

This lack of recognition reflects the obscurity of the comic series compared to other properties from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His getting it right at the end reflects the hope that the film could raise its profile among fans. Judging by the reviews and box office totals, this wish likely came true.

Appropriately, Tony Stark's struggles with alcoholism have long been a major element of the comic book's mythos, and the first movie is ultimately about Stark resolving to turn his life around after getting a second chance at life.
</li><li> The third film was supposed to be an adaptation of the <em> Demon in a Bottle </em> storyline but was changed at Downeys behest. He didnt want to get in the headspace to put his own recovery from alcoholism at risk.

</li><li> Some have viewed the film's premise of the Avengers splitting into two factions going against each other as being accidentally reflective of the massive friction and tension generated by the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The USA at the time was said to have engaged in a kind of "social civil war" having been deeply polarized by its two candidates, particularly the surprising popularity and support of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">most controversial candidate and eventual winner</a>.

There were threats of fights between the extras, and in one instance a filming location had to be changed because of threats from a member of the Bloods. The scene in question contained Doughboy, who is heavily implied to be a Crip, shooting someone who is heavily implied to be a Blood.

The character became a lot more personal to Vicky, and so she decided that the young cat's journey would echo Dan's.

Because the actress knew more about being pregnant and having children, Piper's second pregnancy was a lot more realistic than her first: she wasn't on her feet as much, she didn't fight any demons, she talked about breastfeeding and maternity more, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyMarieCombs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyMarieCombs">Holly Marie Combs</a> was noticeably more maternal with her onscreen children.

Riker's statements about Commander Shelby mirror Piller's feelings about younger writers like Ronald D. Moore. Riker and Guinan's conversation about Riker becoming his own man and "letting go" of Captain Picard in order to beat him could almost be about the show's struggle to find its own identity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">in the long shadow of the original series</a>.

Since Kira was the show's female lead, this would have been hard to hide, so the writers resorted to a plot twist: Keiko O'Brien was pregnant, and her baby had to be <em>transplanted into Kira</em> to save its life after an accident, and then (because of Kira's biology) couldn't be taken back out before the due date. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS05E01ApocalypseRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS05E01ApocalypseRising">Apocalypse Rising</a>", Kira is talking with Dr. Bashir, she gets off the line "this [pregnancy] is all <em><strong>YOUR</strong></em> fault."

Nana Visitor is severely claustrophobic and found the Cardassian makeup incredibly uncomfortable, eventually ripping it off her face when a take took too long.

</li><li> The "Equinox" two-parter seem to be suggesting this is how awful it could have been if we had taken a violent route and not produced the show we have — a complete antithesis of Gene Roddenberrys ideals.' Ron D.

As a consequence, <em>Enterprise</em> Seasons 2-4 (and to a large degree the films, which will <em>never</em> wholeheartedly embrace the pacifist and multicultural message of Roddenberry's time) was a show defined by the war on terror. Even before the terrorist attacks, it seemed like the stories were consciously girding themselves for the conservative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">Bush</a> presidency. The cast was mostly white Americans. The Captain was not a scientist or a diplomat, but a ruggedly all-American test pilot.

</li><li> After six series in six years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> took a three-year hiatus between 1994 and 1996 as Craig Charles (Lister) had been arrested, and then cleared, of rape. Co-creator Rob Grant also left for undisclosed reasons. Only two more series (16 episodes) have been made since then, though a recent set of specials suggests the franchise is not quite dead, though certainly, its halt at the top of its momentum did not help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>: A month after actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">Neil Patrick Harris</a> came out as gay, the show introduced Barney's gay brother (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WayneBrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WayneBrady">Wayne Brady</a>), who makes a lifestyle choice with which Barney initially disagrees. Said lifestyle choice being getting married instead of living the life of promiscuity that Barney favors.
<ul><li> The show also hid the pregnancies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CobieSmulders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CobieSmulders">Cobie Smulders</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a> using large, baggy shirts, but towards the end of the season, Hannigan was too big to hide and needed to go on maternity leave, so the writers created a joke that offended Hannigan's character Lily so much that she wouldn't speak to the rest of the group for a month.
<ul><li> This also led to a line in the next season premiere when Marshall asks Robin and Lily if they have lost weight to distract them from a previous comment he had made. Both women's babies had been born during the summer hiatus.
</li></ul></li><li> However, during a later season, several months after Lily became pregnant, Alyson Hannigan announced she was pregnant again.
</li><li> The part in "Vesuvius" where Marshall gets mad about a silly scene where his film counterpart ("Narshall") eats a cake is based on an interview where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel">Jason Segel</a> had criticized the writing on the show. Specifically, he used a hypothetical joke about Marshall eating a cake and then lying about it as an example of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">formulaic</a> the writing on the show had become. The scene in "Vesuvius" was basically the writers having some fun and throwing a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at Segel.

Also, the sudden disappearance of Dr. Erica Hahn was due to the unexplainable firing of actress Brooke Smith.
<ul><li> Season 6 has had to do quite a bit of covering up — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">George was killed in a bus accident when T.R. Knight wished to leave the show</span>, Katherine Heigl was written out for some episodes in order to shoot a movie and spend time with her recently-adopted baby, and Meredith had a storyline that required her to be bedridden to cover up Ellen Pompeo's pregnancy.
<ul><li> And the maternity leave of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaCapshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaCapshaw">Jessica Capshaw</a> (Arizona) led to a hugely important arc: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arizona leaves for Africa, she and Callie break up, Callie sleeps with Mark and gets pregnant, Arizona returns and they reunite and decide to raise the baby together, Arizona ends up proposing and Callie says yes immediately after a near-fatal car accident.</span> A rather extreme example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>.

Second, the first (and only) line for Kyra in the episode is "I just went out to get something to eat!" The line references actress Scarlett Pomers' battle with anorexia (and explains away her absence for the last quarter of the fifth season).

The episode "A Civil War" revealed that her character, Dani Reese, has an Iranian mother and can speak Farsi.
<ul><li> Also, during production on the last season, she became pregnant, which resulted in the last five episodes being rewritten so her character would be recruited for an FBI joint task force and only able to communicate with the main character by phone, requiring the casting of Gabrielle Union as a replacement partner.

This was written into the story as the First Doctor being "trapped in a time eddy" and only being able to communicate with his successors through a viewscreen in the TARDIS. On top of that, it wasn't just his last appearance as the First Doctor but his last acting appearance <em>ever</em>.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>'s refusal to appear in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho20thASTheFiveDoctors">The Five Doctors</a>" was explained away by having the Fourth Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">represented by archival footage</a>) also get trapped in a time eddy.
</li></ul></li><li> During the production of the Second Doctor serial "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber">The Mind Robber</a>", Frazer Hines (Jamie) contracted chicken pox. This resulted in a last-minute rewrite of the serial, which allowed another actor (Hamish Wilson) to play Jamie's part for episode 2 of the serial.
</li><li> In 1970, <em>Doctor Who</em> made the switch from black and white to color. At the same time, the production team came up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> where the Doctor gets exiled to Earth in the 1970s, which allowed them to save the money that would ordinarily get spent on more exotic settings. The producers considered having him face off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">a number of alien invasions</a>. However, it was felt the sheer number of invasions would push <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> too far, and so the Master was introduced as a recurring villain. Furthermore, the Master was originally slated to die saving the Doctor's life. Instead, Roger Delgado (the Master) died in a tragic car accident. Jon Pertwee (the Third Doctor) left the show partly due to this and the Master got new life later, played by other actors.

</li><li> Much as the Fourth Doctor enjoys fighting the robot in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot">Robot</a>", he is clearly bored out of his mind with having to be in UNIT, snoozing with his hat over his eyes or talking over everyone else during the exposition scenes and even having a mini-meltdown at the end about how he refuses to go on like this. The creators were getting sick of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">UNIT limited the space-time travel premise of the show</a>, and the Doctor's boredom is a metaphor for their own boredom and a plea to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisitingTheRoots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisitingTheRoots">get the audience back into space again</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E2TheEndOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E2TheEndOfTheWorld">the second episode of the new series</a>, Rose Tyler rants at the "bitchy trampoline" Cassandra that "she'd rather die" than have any of the cosmetic modifications Cassandra suggests. The very powerful subtext at work here is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper">Billie Piper</a> had <em>anorexia</em> years earlier.
</li><li> A mild case, but it seems very likely that the Tenth Doctor's last line before he regenerates into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">his eleventh incarnation</a> is as much his actor speaking as he is, as said actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a>, got into acting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">play the Doctor</a> and, more or less, was considered one of the best Doctors ever. The line?
<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> I don't want to go.

That's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a> grew up on the Fifth's serials, considers the Fifth his favorite Doctor, and cites <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a> as the reason he wanted to become an actor and eventually play the Doctor. That's Tennant's fanboying you see throughout the whole thing.
</li><li> Not just Tennant's; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, who wrote it, is also an unabashed Davison fanboy.

</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewWaterhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewWaterhouse">Matthew Waterhouse</a> was 16, his older brother committed suicide, just two years before Matthew got the part of Adric.

To explain his in-character entrance as the Doctor at the 2013 <em>Doctor Who</em> Prom not long after filming of that movie wrapped, prefilmed footage clearly filmed before production of <em>How to Catch a Monster</em> began depicted the Doctor (and Clara) getting into the Royal Albert Hall by bodyswapping with people present on the stage; the process caused the Doctor to inherit his target's short hair when he appeared on stage.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>" featured a forgotten incarnation of the Doctor who had fought in the Time War, serving as a metaphor for the Wilderness Years and the many diverging, convoluted arms of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> that took over the Doctor's 'life' at that time.
</li><li> Smith's final episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor">"The Time of the Doctor"</a>, has the Eleventh Doctor suffer a leg injury that leads to him either limping or using a cane for the remainder of the story. This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>, as Smith had hurt his leg in real life just prior to the start of filming.
</li><li> Also in his last episode, Smith's baldness was written into the story, allowing him to conceal a spare TARDIS key under his wig. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, he'd shaved his head for a film role; in-Whoniverse, Clara correctly deduces that Eleven cut off his hair on a whim because he was bored.
</li><li> Eleven's final lines, right before he regenerates could easily be interpreted as Matt Smith saying the lines in regards to his tenure as The Doctor:
<div class="indent"><strong>Eleventh Doctor/Matt Smith:</strong> I will always remember when The Doctor was me.
</div></li><li> The subsequent season premier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">"Deep Breath"</a>, contains a large amount of commentary about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>, who is currently the oldest actor to portray the Doctor in the revived series. Clara acts as a stand-in for the audience and questions the legitimacy of the new, physically aged Doctor, which parallels the fervor in the fanbase about such an old actor playing the character after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a> precedent that was set with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a>.

It is very easy to see this as Peter Capaldi and Steven Moffat wishing their successors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker">Jodie Whittaker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall">Chris Chibnall</a>) all the best.
</li><li> There are a lot of examples to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>, as he was the most blatant example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaCasting">Meta Casting</a> yet seen on the whole show, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes">Robert Holmes</a>, who edited much of his era, thought he was an interesting person enough that he deliberately wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorSharedBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorSharedBackground">elements inspired by Baker's life into the Doctor's backstory</a>, or would use the show to criticize aspects of Baker's behavior.
<ul><li> One of the Fourth Doctor's most overwhelmingly common villain templates was religious fanatics or ritual-obsessed villains, usually in robes and using Catholic-inflected iconography. He had spent his teens and the beginning of his 20s as a monk in an extremely repressive environment and still carried emotional damage from this, and enjoyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">the opportunity to work out his issues by shouting at people in cassocks</a>, which the writers were happy to give him. In particular, Holmes based Time Lord society on the organizational style of the Catholic Church.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius">The Brain of Morbius</a>"'s plot kicks off when a religious fanatic looks up to make eye contact with the Doctor and becomes infatuated with his face. This is peculiarly similar to a formative experience Tom Baker recounts in his biography, where, as a monk forbidden to look at faces, he'd accidentally glanced up to see another novice and become infatuated with his face.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes">Robert Holmes</a> wrote "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang">The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a>" at a time when Baker's mental health was starting to fail him, and his ego and drinking habit was beginning to cause production issues and public embarrassment. The story portrays the Doctor as very selfish and aloof, paying little attention to Leela and trying to ditch her four times (as Baker hated the character and had been pushing for her to be written out), contains a setpiece where the Doctor intentionally upstages another actor on a stage as a mindgame (Baker often hogged scenes and stepped on lines to abuse actors he disliked), and also portrays the Doctor as having a secret alcohol stash.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor audio drama "The Justice of Jalxar" contains a scene where the Doctor has to protect a group of innocents by confessing to all the crimes he has committed to a homicidal justice robot, so it would pursue him rather than the ordinary people. His confession is structured like a Catholic confession and involves him begging "mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa", something absurdly uncomfortable to listeners aware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> had spent years as a Catholic monk not allowed to look at people's faces, forbidden to laugh, repeatedly made to repeat that he was worthless and told that if he ever left he would go mad outside, leaving him with lifelong emotional damage.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Combining Reality Subtext and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>, many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> fans believe that Trini, the original Yellow Ranger, is dead, since her actress, Thuy Trang, died in a car accident. Her death has never been mentioned on-screen, but since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> shows are usually independent of each other, this is not surprising. However, this one's purely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow">Reunion Shows</a> involving characters who knew her have never mentioned anything bad had happened to her.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Power Rangers Dino Thunder</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank">Jason David Frank</a> - playing veteran ranger and mentor Tommy - had prior commitments in the USA in the middle of filming (which takes place in New Zealand), and so the producers arranged to have Tommy first trapped in amber, then stuck in his Ranger suit, and then finally invisible (so that Frank could provide voice-overs without having to be present on set).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>: Kendrix, the Pink Galaxy Ranger, makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a> near the end of the teamup with the Space Rangers. Her actress had to leave the show to undergo leukemia treatments. She was written out in this manner so that if the treatments were unsuccessful (as is all too often the case) people would have a grand heroic deed to remember her by. Fortunately, the treatments worked, and as a result, Kendrix was revived at the end.
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em> episode shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickVanDyke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickVanDyke">Dick Van Dyke</a> as the character of Mark Sloan watching home movie footage of himself playing 'cowboys' with his son Steve (played by real-life son Barry). This is in fact real footage of Dick Van Dyke presumably playing 'cowboys' with a toddler age Barry though it could conceivably be another family member.
</li><li> A.J. Langer came down with the chicken pox during filming of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife">My So-Called Life</a></em> episode "Life of Brian" (which has nothing to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">the Monty Python film</a>). This resulted not only in her very limited screen time in that episode but also in having all of the makeup to be thrown out.
</li><li> For the first three or four seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, the character of Marcy was married to a materialistic banker named Steve Rhoades, played by David Garrison. When Garrison grew tired of television and did not want to continue the series, he and the producers mutually agreed to write off his character. Over the course of several episodes, Steve would be phased out of the show, culminating in his going to jail and Marcy's divorcing him. Garrison would, however, return to play the role of Steve several times during the rest of the show's run.
<ul><li> Another example came from Katey Segal's first pregnancy. The writers fully embraced it as material for that season and had Peg in-show getting pregnant as well. Unfortunately, this plan did not materialize as perfectly as the writers hoped. Right before the predetermined birth, Katey suffered a miscarriage. This forced the writers to give the season an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> ending because having an infant on-set would be traumatic for Segal. Fans were initially displeased, but after the writers explained the tragic situation behind the season finale, they cooled down and expressed their condolences to Segal. Segal would become pregnant twice more during the show's run, thankfully successfully both times. Both times, the writers had Peg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and invoked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">The Bus Came Back</a> when Segal was ready to return to work.

Melchett's actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>, was an alumnus of Cambridge, whereas Blackadder's actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a>, attended Oxford.

Vancouver is rainy, forested, and has similar architecture to the Eastern US. Los Angeles mostly looks like Los Angeles. As a result, there were substantially more episodes set in the American Southwest, which LA can credibly replicate.
<ul><li> <em>The X-Files</em> first did this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a> first became pregnant. For a while, her character Dana Scully was wearing her trenchcoat and sitting behind desks a lot more until she was abducted by aliens and was gone for the length of Anderson's maternity leave.
</li><li> Not only that but when Scully returned she was in a coma for most of an episode. Due to complications from the pregnancy, her pallor didn't need a lot of make-up.
</li><li> This had even more effect on the plot than most such cases since it helped kick-start the show's long-term myth arc, whereas before it had only featured vague alien-related plots and unconnected events.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">Peter Sellers</a> guest starred on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>, there was a brief bit where Kermit told him that he could feel free to drop his personas while backstage and be himself. Sellers' response was, "There is no me; I do not exist. There used to be a me... but I had it surgically removed." He meant it.
<ul><li> Sellers' claim that he existed as only what others wanted him to be was based on feeling his real self wasn't sufficiently able to make others or himself happy (and a desire to protect his privacy). In any case, his fascination with being others and never himself was what caused him to identify so much with Chance the Gardener in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Being There</a></em>, to the point of spending much of his final years getting a film adaptation made so he could play Chance. Indeed, his family and friends have argued that of all of Peter's characters, Chance is by far the closest to who he actually was as a person.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly">Gene Kelly</a> guest starred, Scooter predicted the world would end and Beauregard was certain it was true.

</li></ul></li><li> Let's just say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaredPadalecki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaredPadalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>, the star of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> is somewhat... accident-prone.
<ul><li> When Padalecki broke his wrist partway through filming an episode in season 3, Sam Winchester had to break his wrist in a fight. There then follows at least one episode where Sam doesn't seem to do much while Padalecki was dealing with the pain and painkillers.
</li><li> In one episode of season 4, Sam was only onscreen for forty seconds because Padalecki was busy filming the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th2009">Friday the 13th (2009)</a></em> remake.
</li><li> In Season 10, Sam begins the first few episodes with his arm immobilized in a sling after having badly dislocated his shoulder before season 10 filming began. Padalecki had undergone surgery and had clearly lost a bit of weight, but could be explained in character due to the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dean had literally disappeared for weeks after dying in Sam's arms. Turns out, Dean had become a demon.</span> Multiple characters bring up the injury in-universe -at least once per episode for the first four episodes.

In real life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YancyButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YancyButler">Yancy Butler</a> has had battles with alcoholism, which led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">the show's cancellation after the second season</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight">Sports Night</a></em>, Robert Guillaume's real-life stroke was written into the story line as a stroke suffered by his character, executive producer Isaac Jaffee. This led to some very emotional scenes upon his return. Likewise, the on-screen portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> throughout season 2, was almost certainly Aaron Sorkin's somewhat pissy reaction to the same. The latter theme would reappear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em>.

Aaron Sorkin had recently broken up with his blonde, Christian girlfriend having had many of the same conflicts with her. Critics were quite to point out that this gave Sorkin an opportunity to win all the arguments by proxy since he was now writing both sides.

<ul><li> Vir Cotto got a lot slimmer halfway through the series, which fit with the character developing from mostly comic relief to playing a more serious role in the show. In reality, Stephen Furst had been ordered to lose weight after becoming diabetic.
</li><li> Zack Allan's complaints about his ill-fitting uniform were based - in some cases word for word - on that character's actor, Jeff Conaway, complaining about his ill-fitting costume. (When he later gets a change of costume, it is a notably better fit.)

One of Claudia Christian's brothers was killed by a drunk driver when they were kids, and she placed the other earring in his casket at the memorial service. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacguffin">Ivanova's reason</a> for wearing the single earring was made explicit in the prequel movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveFilm01InTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveFilm01InTheBeginning">In the Beginning</a></em>, which shows that she gave the other earring to her older brother for good luck, only for him to die during the Earth-Minbari War.
</li><li> The infamous "teddy bear meets airlock" and the annoyance over merchandising? Yeah, JMS had a lot of pent-up frustration, particularly at Kenner, over their interference with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> to make the series more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toyetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toyetic">Toyetic</a>, so when he had an opportunity to take a clean shot at toy companies, he did so with glee.
</li><li> Ivanova shows up in one episode leading a gaggle of Drazi with her leg in a cast. Reference to the rather... rambunctious nature of Drazi politics? No, Claudia Christian was in an accident and broke her leg. However, it was left in because it fit in hilariously well with what was going on in the character's life at the time.

</li><li> In one episode, Briscoe is huddled by the door of a courtroom with some cops and is providing whispered commentary so as not to interrupt what's going on inside. The scene was written this way because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryOrbach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryOrbach">Jerry Orbach</a> was so weak from cancer treatments that he couldn't raise his voice to a normal speaking volume.

(He still appeared in every episode, just not as many scenes). Many of the scenes revolving around Monica's support of him moving probably reflected the real life support the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Friends cast</a> gave Matthew Perry during this time. (Especially as other cast members said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CourteneyCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CourteneyCox">Courteney Cox</a> who plays Monica, was one of the most supportive people for him).
</li><li> Chandler's weight also fluctuated throughout the series, much more than the other characters, due to Matthew Perry's drug problems. In the early episodes, Chandler was average size, however, in later seasons he was extremely skinny and in other seasons he gained weight back. In one case he looked noticeably heavier in a season premiere that was supposed to take place shortly after the previous season's finale.
</li><li> Monica and Chandler's struggle to have children while not based on Courteney Cox's miscarriages did reflect her situation. To the extent, Courteney found some scenes difficult to film, and Matthew Perry's previously mentioned close friendship with her meant his delivery of Chandler's "she's mother without a child" speech was particularly heartbreaking and emotional.

The Fox Network refused to sign off on the proposed plotline of season 3, forcing the writers to redo everything, and their new season arc came to involve the death of Callies' character. The actress refused to return to work just to be killed off, hence her offscreen death in the fourth episode of season three.

He miraculously survived the event with little lasting damage except for a rather large scar down the back of his neck. To allow him to recover but still be an active part of the show for its final season the writers came up with a scenario involving Anders being struck by a bullet and suffering massive brain trauma and being immobile for the remainder of the show but still an integral part of the final arc. By the time the post-script move <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Plan</a></em> went into production, he was back on his feet and back to doing the kind of stuff his character was known for.

</li></ul></li><li> In the 1983 adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong">Jin Yong</a>'s story <em>Return of the Condor Heroes</em>, numerous people applauded the performance of how love-struck and romantic Andy Lau (who played Yang Guo) was towards Idy Chan (who played the character's love, Xiao Long Nu). Apparently, Andy Lau has since admitted that he harbored a huge crush on Idy Chan. To quote him, "When I collaborated in <em>Return of the Condor Heroes</em> with her, I really felt that she's my girlfriend. When we go home after work, I would be worried about her and think of her. Then when we collaborated again in <em>Casino Raiders</em> where she played Alan Tam's girlfriend, I felt unhappy about it."
</li><li> Alaina Huffman's pregnancy has apparently been written into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>. In fact the <em>Stargate</em> canon has never (in 16 seasons of television starring at least one and usually two or more women) included a pregnancy it wasn't forced into by actress pregnancies. The best one is probably the first, Sha're's pregnancy with the Harcesis, which actually came about because Vaitiare Bandera was pregnant. The father was Michael Shanks, who played Sha're's husband, Daniel. Less important for the series but the same father, Dr. Lam/Lexa Doig, which resulted in Lam just disappearing for a while without explanation. Note to producers: keep Michael away from your actresses.
<ul><li> Later on Amanda Tapping was in Area 51 for 6 episodes at the beginning of the ninth season because of her pregnancy - lots of cunning video-conferencing with conveniently placed computers. While she was away Claudia Black did a guest spot on the show to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">inject some estrogen</a>. At the end of the ninth season Black's character, Vala, returns...and she's pregnant, because Black was.
</li><li> Teyla's pregnancy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> was because of Rachel Luttrell's real-life pregnancy. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">But Michael Shanks wasn't even on that show</a>!)
</li><li> And a non-pregnancy <em>Stargate</em> one — in the episode "Nemesis" Daniel Jackson is mostly out of the picture because he has appendicitis... because Michael Shanks was recovering from appendicitis.
</li><li> Also, Jack O'Neill was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">transferred to the Pentagon to head Homeworld Command</a> when Richard Dean Anderson decided he wanted to retire. Later on in the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">his replacement</a> Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), complains about shows who lose their lead actors and just replace him with a younger version of the same guy.
</li><li> General Hammond died of a heart attack because of the death of his actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonSDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonSDavis">Don S. Davis</a>. The <em>Daedalus</em>-class battlecruiser <em>George Hammond</em> in one of the movies and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> was renamed in his honor.
</li><li> In <em>Family Ties</em>, Carter and Jacek have a conversation which is ostensibly about the lack of funding given to the SGC, but is actually an obvious reference to the then-recent cancellation of the show and its replacement with the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka">Eureka</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jacek:</strong> I don't mind telling you, I'm a bit disappointed in this facility. I was expecting more. <br/><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, at times so do we. But the truth is the Stargate Program just doesn't get the support it used to from the people in charge. <br/><strong>Jacek:</strong> Why not? <br/><strong>Lee:</strong> <em>[working on something nearby]</em> Eureka! One down, twelve to go. <br/><strong>Jacek:</strong> That's too bad, because after all your Stargate Program has accomplished for this <strong>network</strong> of planets, I would think the decision makers would show it the respect it deserves.
</div></li><li> Poor Sergeant Siler is the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, who always gets voluntold and blown up or beaten for his troubles so often it has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>. However, there's a reason for this. Dan Shea, who plays Siler, is also the series' stunt co-ordinator (as well as Richard Dean Anderson's stunt double), so of course he does all the cool stunts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MakeItOrBreakIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MakeItOrBreakIt">Make It or Break It</a></em> actress Chelsea Hobbs (Emily Kmetko) was pregnant so this was written into her character's story arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The final season opens with an episode where Joel Hodgson (the creator and original host) made a cameo after leaving five seasons before. Replacement host Mike Nelson becomes jealous that he got to escape and have a normal life, and Tom cautions him "Don't compare yourself. It ain't healthy." This line is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nod</a> to the "Joel vs. Mike" debates that raged over the Internet when Hodgson first left the series, debates that still go on to this day over a decade later (despite the fact that Hodgson and Nelson are good friends).
</li><li> During an Season Seven episode, Crow goes through a hassle trying to get his film made and marketed. This mirrors the tough times getting the <em>MST3K</em> film made and marketed.
</li><li> The episode <em>Gamera vs. Guiron</em>, has a line that's become infamous as the show's most obscure joke ever. There's a shot of a girl running away from the camera, and Tom Servo shouts, "Look out, Mike, she's got your keyboard!" This was a reference to the fact that head writer Mike Nelson was once dumped by a woman who stole his keyboard and took it back to Japan with her. (And this was back when Joel was the lead character, and Mike Nelson only made occasional appearances in front of the camera.)
</li></ul></li><li> During the filming of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> pilot, Kirsten Nelson (Chief Vick) was pregnant. While she gave birth before the filming started proper, they never hid it in the pilot, and her character continued to be pregnant until halfway through the first season.
<ul><li> Timothy Omundson (Lassiter) broke his collarbone in a mountain biking accident. Consequently, Lassiter's arm was in a sling for a few episodes in season 2, an injury that he mysteriously never explained despite being asked by other characters.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, Jane Leeves' pregnancy was written into the show. The guilt Daphne suffers as a result of leaving Donnie at the altar, and the difficulties in Daphne and Niles' new relationship, cause Daphne to begin overeating. She gains sixty pounds, but Niles is so blinded by love he doesn't notice until Daphne falls to the floor and is too heavy to get up without the help of Frasier, Niles and Martin (who remarks "it took three Cranes to lift you!") The weight problem was written into the show to allow Leeves to continue working while pregnant. Daphne then left for several weeks to attend "fat camp" and returned with her figure restored. During the episode "It Takes Two to Tangle" in which she did not appear while at the resort, Niles tells Roz that Daphne had lost 9 pounds, 12 ounces (the weight of Leeves' baby in real life). Leeves' second pregnancy, in the 11th season, was written into the show as her character getting pregnant, though.
</li><li> JJ's eponymous final episode for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> is practically this. The cast and crew's sentiments about the decision to fire A.J. Cook were expressed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">very subtly</a> and emotions of the other characters during JJ's farewell weren't just acting, they were real.
<ul><li> And the reason that JJ has to leave the BAU is extremely close to the reason that AJ Cook had to leave the show: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">mandates from those higher up</a>.
</li><li> Prentiss' departure was also forced by the same mandate, requiring the producers to fire Paget Brewster. Both ladies made it back after one season and a <em>very</em> aggressive fan campaign.
</li><li> Matthew Gray Gubler injured his knee while filming <em>500 Days Of Summer</em> and so his character Spencer Reid had to be shot in the leg to explain this.
<ul><li> In fact, earlier in the show, a wrist injury on Gubler's part required Reid to go through the same.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode <em>Coda</em> centers around Reid and Rossi trying to communicate with a young autistic witness. One of Joe Mantenga (Rossi)'s daughters is autistic. (Interesting sidebar: his other daughter appears in the episode <em>3rd Life</em>.)
</li><li> Reid saving the day with a magic trick in <em>Derailed</em> way back in the first season was written in because Gubler is accomplished at sleight of hand. It's since become a recurring character quirk. In fact, fans often debate how much of what we're seeing onscreen is Reid and how much is Gubler as a profiler.
</li><li> Jason Gideon left the agency due to emotional stress and growing pessimism due to the cases he was working. This reflects actor Mandy Patinkin's growing disgust with the show's grim content.
</li><li> Hotch goes on a temporary assignment (off-screen) in the third episode of season 12 before being revealed to be put in a witness protection system in a later episode. In reality, Thomas Gibson was fired due to an altercation with a co-writer.
</li></ul></li><li> Following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter">John Ritter</a>'s tragic and sudden death (he collapsed on set), his show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules">8 Simple Rules</a></em> aired a sobering episode about his character dying in an accident and his family dealing with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "The Jacket", Jerry and George meet Elaine's father, Alton, and they're very intimidated by him. Lawrence Tierney, the actor who played Alton, scared the <em>Seinfeld</em> cast and crew just as much with his offscreen behavior (he stole a butcher knife from the set and hid it under his jacket), which is why the character never appeared again.
</li><li> Jason Alexander struggled to act alongside Heidi Swedberg, who played George's on-and-off girlfriend Susan, and felt that his comedic sensibility was "off" in every scene they did together. He claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">Larry David chose her as George's fiancée in Season 7 for this exact reason</a>, stating that their <em>non</em>-chemistry created the perfect effect as people would neither root for or against them as a couple.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid">Larry David</a>'s divorce with his real life wife led to Season 6 onwards being about Larry and Cheryl's gradually worsening relationship. In Season 8, they actually get divorced. This has considerably changed how the series might have continued.
</li><li> Shane Conor's drug problems and alleged violence on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em> led to him being fired from the show, so his character Joe Scully implausibly disappeared to run a farm in Bendigo.
</li><li> Mr. Humphries of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed">Are You Being Served?</a></em> was eventually promoted to Senior Salesman because the producers were tired of casting elderly actors who subsequently died. In turn, actor John Inman asked for Humphries' promotion not to be formally acknowledged, because he was superstitious about all those dead actors before him.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em> when through two elderly female bailiff characters, with both actresses dying, so the producers finally cast a younger actress for Roz, who happily survived the rest of show's run.
</li><li> Then there is the insanity that is the show formerly known as <em>Valerie</em>. Star Valerie Harper was let go at the very start of production of season 3, amid accusations of demanding too much money and being hard to work with; her character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">killed off</a> and replaced with Sandy Duncan (who played her sister-in-law), and the title was changed to <em>Valerie's Family: The Hogans</em>. Then Harper won a defamation suit against the studio, forcing them to change the title again to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoganFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoganFamily">The Hogan Family</a></em>.
</li><li> In the middle of filming the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus">Titus</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CynthiaWatros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CynthiaWatros">Cynthia Watros</a> became pregnant. <em>Their</em> way of hiding it was rather ingenious; during the early stages, her character wore a lot of baggy, shabby clothes, as she had temporarily gone back to her parents and pretty much given up on her dreams after Christopher started drinking again (long story), and she was still getting over that. Later, as she got bigger, her character broke her leg chasing after a burglar, and spent the bulk of the rest of the season in a wheelchair. They <em>did</em> also work the pregnancy into a cutaway gag; Erin wins a pie-eating contest, then stands up triumphantly, revealing a swollen belly.
</li><li> Following the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a>, the first episode of the next season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em> had the WNYX staff dealing with the death of his character, Bill McNeal of a heart attack in front of the TV. Apparently the actors <em>weren't acting</em>. Their responses to Bill's death mirror the actor's actual responses to Phil's death, including, apparently, Beth (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VickiLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VickiLewis">Vicki Lewis</a>) standing outside Bill's apartment, drunk, calling his name, and Matthew (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyDick">Andy Dick</a>) believing Bill's gonna come back somehow. Of course, <em>that</em> puts an extra subtext on Dick's fucked up behavior the last few years (particularly the incident that caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz">Jon Lovitz</a> to beat the crap out of him).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance">Sonny with a Chance</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">retooled</a> into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoRandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoRandom">So Random!</a>!</em> due to the departure of star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a> following her rehabilitation from eating disorders, self-harm and depression.
</li><li> During the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, Hercules received less screentime. Iolaus and Autolycus got more to do, a Autolycus/Salmoneus episode (which Herc doesn't even appear in) and several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungHercules">Young Hercules</a> episodes were produced. This was due to Kevin Sorbo's health problems that year and production worked to accomodate while he recovered. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> "Yes, Virginia, There Is A Hercules" is quite obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>, as it shows a production team desperately trying to do the show when Sorbo is suddenly unavailable.
<ul><li> During a <em>Xena</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> "Prometheus," Michael Hurst injured his arm during a fight sequence. In "Cast A Giant Shadow," Iolaus' arm is subsequently injured and shown in a cast for a couple episodes.
</li><li> "Regrets... I've Had A Few" was filmed at the end of Season 3. Kevin Sorbo was eager to start his vacation, so the writing staff decided to give him less to do and plug the <em>Young Hercules</em> pilot at the same time.
</li><li> In "For Those Of You Just Joining Us," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Rob Tapert</a> announces his plan to kill off Iolaus in the fifth season to generate interest in the series. He mockingly says this Paul Coyle, who is being played by Michael Hurst. The real-life Tapert actually did do this with Hurst for those reasons, though presumably in a far kinder way, of course.
</li></ul></li><li> Early into the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucyLawless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucyLawless">Lucy Lawless</a> broke her pelvis during a stunt accident on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>. More so than with Sorbo the following year, production jumped through hoops to make it work. Xena's bodyswitch with Callisto in "Intimate Stranger" carried on into "Ten Little Warlords," she now died at the end of "Destiny" and new Xena-lite scripts were produced (such as "The Quest," "Necessary Evil" and "For Him the Bell Tolls") to give Lawless time to recover.
</li><li> The breakup of Penny and Leonard on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">was certainly not inspired by the fact that Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki broke up in real life around the same time</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Surely!</a>
<ul><li> Also, several episodes featured Penny tending bar at work and not much of her being seen from the waist down. This coincided with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaleyCuoco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaleyCuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a>'s leg being in a cast after she was seriously injured while horseback riding.
</li><li> Similar tactics were needed when Mayim Bialik (Amy Farrah Fowler) injured her hand in a car accident. For several episodes, Amy's hand was always out of the shot, usually hidden behind things or placed beneath a tabletop.
</li></ul></li><li> The TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom">Max Headroom</a></em> was about an investigative reporter fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">MegaCorps</a> using the power of pirate broadcasting. Seven months after its American debut, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion_incident">we got this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen">Tim Allen</a>'s sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em> sees his first lines including "I'm back!" and "It's good to be home" - referencing his return to TV and network ABC over ten years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> ended.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em>, Sophie disappears to go "find herself". This is because of actress Gina Bellman's real-life pregnancy.
<ul><li> Several episodes are centered around examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowoff">The Cast Showoff</a>. <em>The Schehearade Job</em> involves Alec Hardison playing the violin, which Aldis Hodge can do in real life. <em>The Studio Job</em> centers entirely around Eliot performing country music, while Christian Kane has his own country band.
</li></ul></li><li> Because of the intense, complicated nature of their storylines, this is often seen on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">soap operas</a>. One actress' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> struggle with losing her pregnancy weight was turned into a storyline for her character, with the actress admitting that many of the things her character said were things she had said to her own husband (though her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> methods never became as extreme as her character, who turned to diet pills and eventually ran down her friend's son—who lived, fortunately—while high), while several others' decision to have plastic surgery was also played out on the show. But the most prominent example has been with onscreen romances eventually transcending to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Two especially eerie examples include two characters who were involved in an extramarital affair—the actors eventually left their spouses to marry each other, while at least two others had a couple's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> love story virtually parallel their onscreen one—meeting, friendship, dating, marriage, children...and divorce.
<ul><li> NYPD Officer John Perry had a recurring role as a police officer on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>. On September 11, 2001, he was at One Police Plaza (just a few blocks away from the World Trade Center) when he learned of the attacks and dashed to the site to help. He was killed when the South Tower collapsed. In September 2002, the first anniversary was commemorated when Llanview's Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan gazed at a photo of Perry and sadly commented, "I can't believe it's been a year" The in-universe story was that Perry had been <em>visiting</em> New York that day (the show is set in Pennsylvania), but died just as he had in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. It's not hard to imagine that Robert Woods (who played Bo), didn't have to do much acting to convey his grief. Until the end of the series, Perry's picture was visible during any scenes set in the police station.
</li><li> In the spring of 1993, actor Clint Ritchie was badly injured in an accident on his California ranch. Storylines for his character Clint Buchanan were nixed and the character was written off for the summer as having been injured in the same manner. (Once again, it's highly likely that Robert Woods' didn't have to do much acting to convey his joy when Ritchie returned to the set after recuperating).
</li></ul></li><li> By the fourth and final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> adopted a more mature image (she was 18-going-on-19), and had already released the reflective and (slightly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> album <em>Can't Be Tamed</em> earlier in 2010. Many of the plots and themes in <em>Hannah</em> seemed to address this change, from Miley wincing at the girlish look of the new room her dad put together for her, to Hannah trying new styles of music and getting backlash for it, to Miley Stewart wondering if fans would accept the real Miley without the wigs and flashy clothing after she revealed her identity and performed as herself.
</li><li> Lindsay got pregnant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> because of Anna Belknap's real-life pregnancy. The first time, it was hidden, but the second one was the reason for Lucy's birth.

Subverted in that the actors had broken up before the characters got married.

</li><li> On the season 4 premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, this happens a lot. Abed not wanting to graduate is rather bittersweetly reflective of the show's fans' reaction to this season rumored to be its last. The theme of coping with unexpected/unwelcome change also reflects the numerous behind-the-scenes shake-ups that have dogged the show since the middle of the previous season, chief among them the mid-season hiatus and the firing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon">Dan Harmon</a> as show-runner. Abed's 'happy place' is presented as a rather blandly cheery and formulaic sitcom  the same sort of sitcom fans worried that <em>Community</em> itself would turn into in an attempt to become more 'mainstream' after the firing of Harmon.
<ul><li> Halfway through his guest stint as Robert Laybourne in Season 3, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGoodman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGoodman">John Goodman</a> unexpectedly had to grow a beard and ponytail for his role as a drug dealer in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flight">Flight</a></em>. Troy is surprised by Laybourne's shocking new appearance, which Laybourne <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">claims is a result of</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Going through some stuff right now</a>".

Troy reacts angrily to this and calls Braff a "Son of a bitch" for bailing on the show after it made him famous. In real life, it had been announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino">Donald Glover</a> (Troy's actor) was leaving the show five episodes into the season in order to focus on his rap career, which made the line a bit of good-natured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecatingHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecatingHumor">Self-Deprecating Humor</a>.
<ul><li> The entire episode is this. It's basically an acknowledgment of the show's decline in quality, with Jeff pointing out that none of the characters have accomplished the goals they set out to do at the onset at the series, and have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> parodies of themselves. There's even an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> away the events of the reviled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Season 4</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 5's finale has a similar tone, as the show's future was once again uncertain. With both Donald Glover and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a> gone, some fans began questioning how much longer the show could go on, and to reflect that, Annie asks if Greendale is even worth saving now that Troy and Pierce are both gone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em> had to do this twice with the patriarch of the Ewing family. Jock Ewing was killed off in the fourth season of the original series after actor Jim Davis passed away prior to the season. Then, in an eerily similar situation, JR was killed off in the second season of the new series following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman">Larry Hagman</a>'s death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice">Miami Vice</a></em>, Sonny Crockett has a very contentious working relationship with his commanding officer, Lieutenant Martin Castillo. This "feud" wasn't just created for the cameras - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonJohnson">Don Johnson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardJamesOlmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardJamesOlmos">Edward James Olmos</a> often argued during the first season due to their wildly different acting styles, and there are scenes and moments that unintentionally evoke this feeling of tension between them. Notably occurs in "Nobody Lives Forever" (where Johnson looks visibly disturbed while Olmos glowers at him) and "Back in the World", where Crockett rails at Castillo for not having the resources to do his job (and Olmos not even looking at Johnson until the very end of the scene).
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> finished, writer-producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> said that he belatedly realized that he had written a story about a man having the worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodMidlifeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodMidlifeCrisis">mid-life crisis</a> ever, at a time in his life when he was probably due for one himself.
</li><li> Minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>: actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt">Chris Pratt</a> dropped a significant amount of weight and put on some muscle for his part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty">Zero Dark Thirty</a></em>. They could cover up the muscle by dressing his character Andy in baggy clothes (not much of a departure for the slovenly character); the weight loss is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwaved</a> in a throwaway line revealing that he's given up beer.
</li><li> If one interview, in particular, is any indication, this was the result of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainPowerAndTheSoldiersOfTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainPowerAndTheSoldiersOfTheFuture">Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future</a></em> breaking a number of taboos, including at least two instances of swearing, and an important good guy character being killed off onscreen. In the interview in question, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> reveals that he had known someone who had taken their own life despite his best efforts to stop them, which likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">influenced his decision to write those certain episodes (possibly even more of the series) the way he did</a>.

</li><li> The "show about making a show" premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> gave numerous opportunities for this; a notable example is a season 6 arc involving Tracy Jordan making offensive comments about gay people, which aired less than a year after a similar real-life incident involving the character's actor, Tracy Morgan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> was conceived after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>, who'd sworn that he would never again work with Fox after his terrible experiences making <em>Firefly</em>, was asked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizaDushku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizaDushku">Eliza Dushku</a> to produce a show for her so that she could get out of her contract to Fox. To hear Whedon tell it, Fox treated him very much the same way that Rossum treats its "Actives", which may go a long way towards explaining why the show is much darker than most Mutant Enemy shows.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill">One Tree Hill</a></em>, Lucas Scott and Brooke Davis became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a> after their breakup.

</li><li> Laurel Lance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> is walking with these. She has an alcoholic father, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieCassidy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieCassidy">her actress'</a> father having drinking problems. In the second season, she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a> speech mentioning how people tend to stay away from her, alluding to her status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> to most of the show's fandom. In the third, she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for her sister as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a>, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> and out.
<ul><li> This gets twisted further in Season 4 with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laurel's death</span>. Laurel continued to be a polarizing figure after donning the Black Canary mantle, only for many a fan's view of both Laurel and her previously torpedoed relationship with Oliver Queen to improve dramatically right before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Damien Darhk kills her</span>, though this is also tied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">their wariness</a> with the show's handling and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">shilling</a> of Felicity Smoak—once a fan favorite whose romance with Oliver Laurel was pushed aside for—in the third and fourth seasons. Laurel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> to Oliver, Oliver's laudation of Laurel's contributions to Starling City, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his declaration of vengeance against Darhk</span> all mirror the majority of the current <em>Arrow</em> fandom in some way or another.

She then begins wearing traditional Indian clothes and even has a traditional Hindu ceremony <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for her son Leo</span>.

Dr. Elizabeth Corday and Dr. Peter Benton have a brief and tense relationship that finally fizzles out when she realizes he'll never get over his discomfort of dating a white woman (he's African-American). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, Benton's portrayer, Eriq LaSalle was equally uncomfortable with the relationship, feeling that it sent a negative message to the African-American community and asked the show's writers to nix it.

According to director Koichi Sakamoto, the main actors had become as close as family over the course of the shoot, thus the tears being shed were their real tears over the fact that they were about to go their separate ways. It was made worse was the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryuki Takahashi, Kengo's actor,</span> couldn't be on the set for obvious plot reasons.

</li><li> In late 2014, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum">★</a></em>, recorded early the following year, was composed as a way for Bowie to reflect on this information and the very real possibility that the disease would kill him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">It did</a>: his cancer was declared terminal in November, and he passed away on January 10, 2016, two days after both <em>★</em>'s release and his 69th birthday.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s "Wake Me Up When September Ends" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmericanIdiot">American Idiot</a></em> is about Billie Joe Armstrong's father's death from cancer when Billie was 10. The funeral was at the beginning of September, and when he came home from it with his mum, Billie locked himself in his bedroom, telling his mum to wake him up when the month ended.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryChapin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryChapin">Harry Chapin</a>'s song "Cat's in the Cradle" was based on a poem his wife wrote and was inspired by not being present at his son's birth.
</li><li> Steven Curtis Chapman's song "Cinderella", about a father reflecting on how quickly his daughter is growing up and that he needs to be there for her even when he's busy, was originally inspired by his young daughters trying to get his attention by putting on Cinderella costumes and dancing while he was rushing through their bedtime routine so that he could get to the studio and work. The song—which features lyrics like "Soon the clock will strike midnight and she'll be gone"—took on a tragic meaning later when one of his daughters that inspired the song, Maria Sue, was killed when her older brother accidentally ran over her in the driveway of their home. Although Chapman originally decided to never sing the song live again, he later decided to use the song to reflect his hope that he'd see his daughter again in Heaven, changing the final line from "she'll be gone" to "I know the dance will go on."
</li><li> In-Universe example: in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMightyWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMightyWind">A Mighty Wind</a></em>, Mitch Cohen's solo work after the breakup of the group Mitch &amp; Mickey mimic his growing depression and mental instability, featuring such albums as "Cry for Help" (cover: Mitch in a padded room restrained by a straightjacket) and "Calling it Quits" (cover: Mitch waist-deep in a grave holding a shovel, with a tombstone behind him reading "RIP Mitch Cohen"). Like almost everything else in the movie, this is played for laughs.
</li><li> Teen Pop example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> wrote the songs on her <em>Breakout</em> album following her breakup with her first serious boyfriend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJonas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJonas">Nick Jonas</a>. Several of the songs refer to the breakup.
<ul><li> In turn, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJonasBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJonasBrothers">The Jonas Brothers</a> album <em>Lines, Vines And Trying Times</em> might contain songs written from Nick's standpoint about that same breakup.
</li><li> Miley's 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">New Sound Album</a> <em>Bangerz</em> was recorded at the age of 20-going-on-21 following a transitional period in her life. She had stayed in Detroit filming <em>LOL</em>, then shot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoUndercover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoUndercover">So Undercover</a></em> in Philadelphia, where according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> Miley had for the first time in her life truly grown up, away from her family, her comfort zone in Toluca Lake, California, and her Disney bubble. She had gotten her first tattoo away from the supervision of her mother, went clubbing, gotten to walk around freely in the streets of Philadelphia without paparazzi, enjoying life, and she had gotten a pixie haircut. She left her manager and record label, decided after the limited releases and subsequent flops of those films to concentrate almost exclusively on music and worked on developing a new sound and mature lyrical/musical approach to the album, working with producers Mike Will Made It and Pharrell Williams. She had worked so intensely on the record, apparently her most personal record, that her longtime relationship to fiance Liam Hemsworth deteriorated. They called off their engagement not long before the album came out. The album's lyrics reflect these changes; in keeping with her new image and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> approach, the album was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">with an Explicit Lyrics sticker</a> for the first time in her career.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> and his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin were on a career high in 1976. Albums were debuting at #1, and Elton was perhaps the top solo artist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. Personally, though, Elton and Bernie were both burned out from the rock lifestyle and superstardom. Elton broke up with his boyfriend, manager John Reid, while Bernie's first marriage was collapsing. Elton and Bernie had taken to drugs and alcohol, and Elton would soon reveal himself as a bisexual (in 1988, he would come clean as gay) to <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine, leading to a backlash in Middle America. Elton's mental health was eroding as well, leading to depression and failed suicide attempts. This would be the context of Elton's 1976 double album <em>Blue Moves</em>, an album filled with dark, introspective, despairing songs about failed relationships and dark character studies, with bits of bitter irony scattered around. Oddly enough, it would later be cited as one of Elton's favorite albums that he made.
<ul><li> <em>The One</em> and songs like "Runaway Train", "Simple Life" and the title track, and subsequent songs like "Weight Of The World", "Dark Diamond", "The Bridge" and "My Elusive Drug" reflect on Elton's rehabilitation in 1990.
</li></ul></li><li> 1978 saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> score their first hit, an (at the time) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">uncharacteristically romantic</a> pop ballad called "Follow You Follow Me". They embarked on their longest, most successful tour yet, with a new audience thanks to FYFM's popularity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> returned to an empty home, his wife having left him (she had an affair with the house painter, then left for her native Canada) and taken the kids and dogs with her. Phil and the band took a hiatus for Phil to (unsuccessfully) repair the relationship. He channeled his grief and frustration into his first solo album, <em>Face Value</em>. the songs he contributed to Genesis' <em>Duke</em> album, and some of Phil's <em>Hello, I Must Be Going</em> album. "Against All Odds", in fact, was written around the same time.
<ul><li> Collins later channeled the grief of his second marriage collapsing in songs on his <em>But Seriously...</em> and <em>Both Sides</em> albums. "Dance Into The Light" and <em>Testify</em>, more "up" albums lyrically and musically, celebrate his romance to Orianne Cevey, who would be his third wife (they'd sadly divorce as well).
</li></ul></li><li> Earlier, <em>former</em> Genesis frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> felt stifled. The band wanted to lean more towards top 40 material, whereas he wanted to continue experimenting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a>. This was as the band was starting to reach mainstream success, and Gabriel's personal life (troubled marriage, sick daughter) meant that giving up his creative ambitions looked like a sensible option. He rejected the "sensible option" and started his solo career with the triumphant "Solsbury Hill," about his decision to take that risk and leave.
<ul><li> His 1992 album <em>Us</em> was written while Gabriel was divorcing his first wife Jill, going through a breakup with actress girlfriend Rosanna Arquette, and estranged from his daughter Anna. The resulting album lyrically deals with dysfunction and miscommunication in relationships.
</li><li> <em>Up</em> deals with mortality and death, a reflection of the death of his father and that of a mutual friend.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a>'s "I'll Go On Loving You" (self-explanatory) was released around the time that he and longtime wife Denise were going through some rough times, and actually spent some time apart from each other to cool down.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a> recorded her hit, "Skyscraper", during the time period when her then-unknown depression, eating disorder and self-harm issues were at their peak, and her bulimia was damaging her voice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">She claims</a> the raw, emotional vocal take used was Demi singing from the heart as a kind of cry for help. A more technically polished take was apparently attempted post-rehab, but she preferred the more raw and emotional performance from the year before.
</li><li> The nostalgic, fun-loving album <em>An Innocent Man</em> was recorded in 1983 during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s courtship to supermodel Christie Brinkley, who would be Billy's second wife. The bitter, self-reflective <em>River Of Dreams</em> was recorded in 1994 following his legal battle with his ex-brother-in-law (to his first wife) turned financial manager, and while Joel was breaking up with Brinkley.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem">Afro Celt Sound System</a>'s song "Release" is sung <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation">from the perspective of someone dead</a>, encouraging the living to not "argue amongst yourselves / because of the loss of me", and to "be happy for me". These lyrics were written in the aftermath of keyboardist Jo Bruce's sudden death—the rest of the band had to put their upcoming album on hiatus as they mourned. Sinead O'Connor penned the lyrics, and it was the inspiration the band needed to come to terms with Bruce's death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> was actually Roger Waters' way of dealing with the realization that he was becoming a cold destructive person, like Pink, the eponymous character of the album, and a way for him to reverse course on that. There are numerous other references to Pink Floyd's internal issues throughout the album as well, such as Pink saying that he has "a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains" being a reference to Richard Wright's cocaine addiction.
<ul><li> Waters wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>, <em>The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking</em> and parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut">The Final Cut</a></em> (mostly songs left off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>) in the same 1978-79 period, during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a>. The songs are lyrically and musically similar to each other and share similar themes of adultery, divorce, alienation, personal reflection, paranoia, fear, war, lack of communication and aging.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a> was written while Waters was 29, and fearing time pass him by while he felt disappointed that he hadn't really had a real breakthrough success with Pink Floyd in the years following Syd Barrett's departure. Much of the album deals with mortality and the meaning of life. The follow-up, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a></em>, was built around the pressures of the music industry, the band's disjointing and lack of focus when under pressure to record DSOTM and watching the positive and negative effects of their amazing success affect the band.
</li><li> David Gilmour wrote <em>The Division Bell</em> after a period dealing with cocaine addiction and overeating, adultery, legal issues, a painful divorce from his first wife, an initially sometimes-rocky relationship with his current wife, troublesome relations between himself and his Pink Floyd band members, a period of writers block and his estrangement from Roger Waters. The album deals with breakdowns in communication and the struggles he faced during that time.
</li><li> The themes of lack of communication between band members and their wives are equally explored on albums like <em>Obscured By Clouds</em> and <em>Atom Heart Mother</em>, notably "Stay", "If" and "Summer '68". All four band members' first marriages would break up by the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> and would contribute to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdowns</a> of each member (Gilmour, Wright, and Mason would be affected vias strong cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock">Writer's Block</a>, which would lead indirectly to their estrangement from Roger Waters).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> and as a solo artist, often wrote songs based on his personal life, sometimes as events were happening to him. Most famously, his <em>Mind Games</em> and <em>Walls And Bridges</em> albums (1973 and 1974 respectively) were written as John and Yoko separated and as John moved to Los Angeles to go through a painful two-year alcoholic binge he later referred to as his "lost weekend". <em>Double Fantasy</em> (1980) and <em>Milk And Honey</em> (recorded in 1980; posthumously released in 1984) saw John five years later, having reunited with Yoko, moved back to New York City, cleaned up, taken control of his life and living away from the music industry for five years to raise their son Sean and become a house-husband.
</li><li> Lennon's ex-writing partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> wrote the 1972 song "Dear Friend" as a peace offering to Lennon during the pair's very public feuding, and the 1982 song "Here Today" as a posthumous tribute to John. "Put It There" was a tribute to Paul's then recently deceased father.
<ul><li> Paul's <em>Driving Rain</em> album was written while he was in the glow of love to second wife Heather Mills. <em>Chaos And Creation In The Backyard</em>, in retrospect, may have reflected the pair's strained relationship, which would end in a bitter divorce.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Wings</a> guitarist Jimmy McCulloch struggled with drug and alcohol dependency, and his two Wings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone">compositions</a>, "Medicine Jar" from <em>Venus And Mars", and "Wino Junko" from </em>Wings At The Speed Of Sound", seem to reflect on his struggles. He died in 1979 of morphine and alcohol poisoning, two years after leaving Wings and a short stint in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmallFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmallFaces">The Small Faces</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a>' "Two Sisters" is about a young woman who is married with children - she starts off being jealous of the more glamorous life led by her single, freewheeling sister, then realizes she's better off because her children are important to her. Ray Davies actually meant the song to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> portrayal of the relationship at the time to his band-mate and brother Dave Davies: He was married with children, while Dave was single and more free to live the rock star lifestyle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>'s <em>St. Anger</em> was born out of struggling with diminishing relationships between the band members, alcoholism and never getting over Cliff Burton's death. This is all painfully documented in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rockumentary">rockumentary</a> <em>Some Kind Of Monster</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s romantic relationships and personal life are often reflected upon in her songs, sometimes to the point of humorists joking that she must start and end romances to provide subject matter for her music.
<ul><li> Much like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno</a> example right in the anime folder, this may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> when it doesn't end well.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the sometimes foul mood Ian Anderson went through recording <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a>'s <em>Minstrel In The Gallery</em> album, at a time when Ian was going through a divorce from his first wife, and he felt his band splintering and not playing as well together or concentrating on the music as well as they could have been (much of the album was acoustic/acoustical as a result), and he was busy writing the music in tax exile in Monte Carlo while watching "grotesque" tourists lounge around on the beach, the album had an even more cynical, darker (and self-reflective) air to it than usual. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Ian would in later years see it as well-recorded but humorless, and would cite it as one of his less favorite albums as a result</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance">in spite of it being a fan favorite to this day</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Benefit</em> saw Ian coping with success, the pressures of being seen as a countercultural hero, mistaken as a drug user/hippie for his madcap performing image and long hair, and his alienation at not really relating to many aspects of the counterculture who idolized him, such as recreational drug taking. He also saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">conformity</a> in how the counterculture conducted themselves, and in interviews expressed his distaste for the "seas of blue denim" flocking to his concerts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5r055');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5r055" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5r055');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One anecdote made by Ian in an interview taken around this time claimed that had Jesus been alive today, he and Ian would be turning over the racks of blue denim at all of the clothing stores in town</span>. He'd explore this further in <em>Thick As A Brick</em>.)
</li><li> Ian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">also suggested</a> the reasons for <em>A Passion Play</em> being written so complexly and with so little chances for the listener to breathe, is because Ian was fed up with drunken audience members whistling and screaming for "Aqualung" or "Locomotive Breath" during the soft acoustic passages during Tull's performances of <em>Thick As A Brick</em>, a decision that in hindsight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Ian regrets</a>, and felt helped lead the album to be a hard listen (even for Ian) and so critically panned.
</li></ul></li><li> Tragically, the pained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong">breakup songs</a> written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Motown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Motown">Motown</a> staff writer Rodger Penzabene, including <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTemptations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTemptations">The Temptations</a>' hits "I Wish It Would Rain", "You're My Everything" and "I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)" and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GladysKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GladysKnight">Gladys Knight</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a> duet "The End Of Our Road" were inspired by the songwriter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> heartbreak over his wife's adultery, and the couple's subsequent divorce. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, Penzabene would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">commit suicide</a> on New Year's Eve 1967, one week after "I Wish It Would Rain"'s release.
</li><li> Much of the music and lyrics written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>, at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">judging by the liner notes of the 1990s remasters of his albums</a>, seemed to be written by Costello as he gradually took on the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; Roll</a> lifestyle (mainly pills, alcohol and one-night-stands) he promised himself he'd never get involved in. <em>Armed Forces</em> and <em>Get Happy!!</em> in particular are filled with songs of regret, anger, and heartbreak. His lifestyle, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeusedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeusedToBeFriends">dissolution of his friendship</a> with Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas, also seemed to accelerate the end of his first marriage, which would inform latter-period albums like <em>Goodbye Cruel World</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BloodAndChocolate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BloodAndChocolate">Blood and Chocolate</a></em>.
</li><li> "You Try Somebody Else (We'll Be Back Together Again)" was one of the last songs written by B.G. De Sylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson before De Sylva left the songwriting team. De Sylva did go on to write songs with other collaborators (as did Brown and Henderson after they broke up a few years later) but never reunited with Brown or Henderson, and ultimately gave up songwriting to become a movie producer.
</li><li> Dennis DeYoung of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx">Styx</a>, similarly to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a>, felt disenchanted and disappointed in his lack of success in the music industry, and had seriously considered quitting music to be a professional teacher in 1976; thankfully, his wife talked him out of it. Much of his music on <em>The Grand Illusion</em>, <em>Pieces Of Eight</em>, <em>Cornerstone</em> and <em>Paradise Theatre</em> are filled with songs of hope and affirmation. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">claims</a> he wrote the songs about himself to raise up his own hopes to and convince himself to never give up, and that it was a bonus that it touched so many other listeners similarly. Likewise, a lot of <em>Killroy Was Here</em> came about because the band was pissed off about being unfairly smeared by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and the press over a wild and completely false <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory">Conspiracy Theory</a> about alleged Satanic lyrics in their music and the attempts by said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> to try and ban rock albums.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">sole member</a> of Grottomatic was so frustrated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Brony</a> culture that he wrote the song <a class="urllink" href="http://grottomatic.bandcamp.com/track/the-bronies-have-landed">The Bronies Have Landed,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> portraying the whole Brony concept as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">a serious problem.</a> By the time he had finished recording the song, he had learned to love it, and he soon wrote a followup called <a class="urllink" href="http://grottomatic.bandcamp.com/track/girly-cartoon-about-ponies">Girly Cartoon About Ponies,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which praises the show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> were on the verge of breaking up due to differences between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards by 1986's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirtyWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirtyWork">Dirty Work</a></em>, a fact reflected in the conflictive/bitter lyrical content of the album's lyrics/song titles. By 1989's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelWheels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelWheels">Steel Wheels</a></em>, they had patched things up (quite possibly reflected in the album's lead single, "Mixed Emotions").
</li><li> Lisa Loeb's song "I Do" was written to sound like a breakup song, but it is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to the record label agents who claimed they didn't hear a single on the album <em>Firecracker</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a> wrote the song "Freedom '90" expressly to commemorate the end of his contract with Sony Records. His music video for the song included, among other things, him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burning his iconic leather jacket</a> which he had worn in videos and promotional artwork for Wham.
</li><li> A particularly notable example would be the song "Save the Last Dance For Me". Its composer, Doc Pumus, suffered from polio and was inspired to write the song after watching his wife dance with other people at their wedding.
</li><li> At the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> wrote "I Will Always Love You", she was on Porter Waggoner's syndicated TV show. She wanted to leave the show to foster her budding solo career but wanted him to know that she appreciated all he did for her, and her thoughts resulted in the song. After she played it for him, he decided to release her from her contract as long as she had "Love You" recorded. It would go on to become a huge country hit and the rest is history.
</li><li> "Take My Hand, Precious Lord" is a hymn about someone in deep despair begging God to comfort them and give them strength. Thomas A. Dorsey <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/precious.asp">wrote it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after his wife Nettie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">died giving birth to their son</a>, who also died two days later.
</li><li> The Headstones album <em>The Oracle of Hi-Fi</em> has a number of songs that reference rehabilitation, addiction, and mistakes. This album was recorded after lead singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughDillon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughDillon">Hugh Dillon</a> got treatment for drug addiction. Incidentally, it is pretty apparent during the title track of their previous album, <em>Nickels For Your Nightmares</em>, that this album was recorded before his rehabilitation.
</li><li> Lesley Gore's 1972 album, <em>Someplace Else Now</em>, was written entirely by Gore and her writing partner Ellen Weston after a five year absence from the music business, during which Lesley had graduated college, come to terms with her sexuality, found herself becoming less and less in favor in the music industry after her Mercury Records contract expired and opportunities dried up, took on non-musical jobs for a while before deciding to move to California and make a return to the music industry, and refashioned herself as a singer-songwriter in the mold of the then-trendsetting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaroleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaroleKing">Carole King</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LauraNyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LauraNyro">Laura Nyro</a> as outside writers failed to present her with challenging material to record. The album is much more introspective, ambitious, and darker-themed than any Lesley album before (or maybe since).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>
<ul><li> One strip features Calvin getting upset over going to bed because it means that he can't play with Hobbes. Then he realizes that going to sleep doesn't have to mean being apart, because they can always play together in their dreams. Bill Watterson wrote the strip because his cat — who served as the inspiration for Hobbes — had just died, and what made him feel better was realizing that they could always be together in his dreams.
</li><li> In-universe, Calvin imagines himself as various alter egos, the most common ones being Spaceman Spiff, a heroic explorer, Stupendous Man, a superhero, and Tracer Bullet, a detective. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">They all are touted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue">as huge badasses</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSue">in Calvin's imagination</a>, but because they go up against people with more power than Calvin in real life (such as his mom, his teacher, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter">Roslyn</a>), they always lose.
</li><li> There's a <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> Sunday strip where Calvin's father says he sees everything in black and white, which leads Calvin to vividly imagine such a situation, and another with the same premise except with Calvin's father saying the boy doesn't have any sense of perspective, leading to Calvin being trapped in a world with no <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point">vanishing points<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Both strips are based on Watterson's arguments with his syndicate on merchandising, where the company would accuse the cartoonist of seeing no shades of grey and having no perspective.
</li><li> Another brief story arc in the strip saw Calvin placating the monsters under his bed by feeding them garbage, according to Watterson himself, a testament to how he sometimes felt in writing the strip.
</li></ul></li><li> A series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HeartOfTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HeartOfTheCity">Heart of the City</a></em> strips focused on Heart's friend Dean having a pet cat - Spock - who's so sick that his parents are about to have him put to sleep, but in the end, it turns out that it's a dog with the same name as the cat, and the cat is going to recover. The last strip of the series reveals that the cat who inspired the comic version has died.

As a result, The Lone Ranger was laid low for about a week and a half, and could only speak in whispers, until they found Brace Beamer, who would keep the role for the rest of the radio run.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">the Superman radio show</a>, Collyer's vacation times were covered by having the series focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> and Robin instead.

Romero wasn't killed in the line of duty but rather died at home of a heart attack. The cast responds to his death and spends the next several episodes grieving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey">Adventures in Odyssey</a></em>, "The Triangled Web" features a reunion of a number of the original kids. It is mentioned that Jack and Lucy went to the same college in Texas and got married by the end of the episode, reflecting how their voice actors Donald Long and Genni Mullen got married and moved to Texas as well.
</li><li> Done many times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheArchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheArchers">The Archers</a>: it's such a long-runner that a number of characters have been around long enough to become elderly - as have their actors. Dan Archer (the original patriarch), Tom Forrest and Mrs. Antrobus were all given radio deaths because the actor had died of old age. This hasn't always been played straight; when the actor playing Nelson Gabriel died, the character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> instead and other characters continued to refer to him as alive for some months. (News of his death was eventually mentioned.) A non-death example is that sometimes actors become well-known and aren't often available: Tamsin Greig's character, Debbie, has moved abroad but comes back every so often. However, in a similar situation with Lucy Davies (Dawn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK">The Office</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">Shaun of the Dead</a></em>) her character, Hayley, was recast.

</li><li> The first two episodes of season four, "Welcome to Woodland Valley", involved Bear and Ojo's public library being destroyed by a fallen tree as the town's community comes together to repair the building. The episode was made in response to the September 11th attacks which had occurred nearly a year before the season's premiere.

Since this led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rewrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rewrite">rewriting several scenes that were erased by the Time Slip</a>, Sauro-Hunter remarked that he was experiencing deja vu.

<div class="indent">Maltby and Shire are both sons of orchestra leaders: bandleader and recording artist Richard Maltby, Sr. and Irving Shire, for fifty years a leading society bandleader in Buffalo, New York. When, after Williamstown, there was a need for a dramatic turn for the baritone role, Maltby suggested it was time they wrote about their fathers. He already had a title in mind. Shire wrote the melody and sent it to Maltby in London. While waiting for a reply, Shire visited his father in Buffalo, and the events described in the song occurred. When the authors started work on the lyric, Shire described his trip, and Maltby realized <em>that</em> was the story of the song. In a way the song is about itself, for the melody referred to in the lyric is the very melody that Shire played for his father that day in Buffalo.

<ul><li> In the first show, the Phantom fell in love with Christine when he heard her sing, made her the star of an existing opera, then wrote an opera for her to star in. But as Christine realizes he's a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> murderer and stalker, she leaves him for the Viscount Raoul de Chagny.</span> Lloyd Webber met Brightman when she auditioned for Cats and was cast in the role of Jemima. He wrote a successful classical song for her, Pie Jesu, and specifically wrote the part of Christine for her (keeping the character design close to her style, added dance moves in Hannibal so that she could show off her footwork, and the cadenzas in the title song and Think of Me for her vocal range). He left her for another woman after six years of their marriage, and as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Christine clearly still loves the Phantom but cannot stay with him, which the Phantom also acknowledges, the feeling is supposedly identical between Brightman and Lloyd Webber.</span>
</li><li> In the sequel, Raoul <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> became an alcoholic and a gambler (metaphorically cheating on her with his addictions), and his marriage with Christine deteriorates. Christine gets fatally shot by a jealous Meg Giry after an accidental slight from the Phantom, professing her undying love for the Phantom with her last breaths. He gets acknowledged by his son with Christine, Gustave, who was previously thought to be Raoul's son. This mirrors the prevalent attitude of the fandom - that Erik (the Phantom) and Christine are the real crowd-drawer of the show, and that Christine should have chosen to stay with the masked composer in the first place.</span> Raoul's character is completely out of line with his portrayal in the first show, as Erik/Christine shippers tend to turn him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">Ron the Death Eater</a> or make him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">Die for Our Ship</a>.

However, he said, if that person was to have a health scare, then they would feel more inclined to keep an eye on what was happening inside them. Greg later revealed that he himself had been diagnosed with diabetes.
<ul><li> Similarly, the series creator Christian Faber said the idea of Bionicle came about after he had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that required him to take a pill to weed out the tumor. He had wondered if a pill like this was like a warrior going inside his brain to fight off an evil infection threatening his life and ultimately working together in unity with his bodies enzymes and would cure him of this ailment. Thus the idea for the first three years of Bionicle got concocted.

This is referenced in the plot of the sequel, which takes place 25 years after the events of the original. The <em>very first thing</em> Pit says as the game begins is "sorry to keep you waiting!" and it's directed at the audience as much as it is to Palutena.
</li><li> It was also a long time since the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFutureTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFutureTheGame">video game</a> released in 2011, but they managed to get much of the cast back. In the interim years, for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> had gone (mostly) bald.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTalesInTheHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTalesInTheHouse">VeggieTales in the House</a></em>: In "A Gift for Singing", Ichabeezer performs a rap bashing Pa Grape's store that, despite its nasty lyrics, is too much of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm">Ear Worm</a> for anyone to resist. This may be a reference to the controversy that surrounded the "Bunny Song" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> video <em>Rack, Shack &amp; Benny</em>, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a> that, despite its nasty lyrics, was too much of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm">Ear Worm</a> for children to resist singing aloud (to their parents' dismay).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Ducktales2017S2E16TheDuckKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Ducktales2017S2E16TheDuckKnightReturns">"The Duck Knight Returns"</a> had a boatload of this.
<ul><li> Launchpad tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drake Mallard to become Darkwing Duck for real "For Jim [Starling]", the in-universe actor for Darkwing, who was also voiced by Darkwing's original voice (and a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">The Danza</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings">Jim Cummings</a></span>.
</li><li> Around the time the episode aired, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings">Jim Cummings</a>, who voiced the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a> and voices the in-universe actor, Jim Starling, was involved in a nasty custody battle with his ex-wife, who levied accusations of rape and animal abuse against him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7linf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7linf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7linf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The charges were later dropped, though the judge in the custody battle issued restraining orders against both Cummings and his ex-wife and chastised the both of them for putting themselves above their kids.</span> Thus, this gives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an unexpected perspective on Launchpad's loss of respect for Starling after Starling snaps</span>.
</li><li> The episode address issues and questions involved with reboots, something the show itself had to deal with.
