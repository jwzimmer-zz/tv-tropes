<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: In a filler episode of the Vegeta saga, Kami uses a simulation to introduce Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu to the capabilities of the Saiyans. Of course, at the level of strength they then possessed, there was no possible way for them to win. And then Kami points out that the Saiyans seen in the simulation were nowhere near as strong as the two heading for Earth in real life, putting the power gap in perspective; that's when they begin training even harder.

</li><li> Many times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> series, although they're in a virtual world to begin with.
</li><li> Used once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>, where Gene goes through several launch simulations. Each time, something goes badly wrong as a test to see how he reacts in unanticipated situations. Needless to say, it pissed him off, and the first launch went perfectly... if you don't count the thousands of dollars worth of damage he caused to the landing dock.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> doesn't use it in its narrative, but in one interview the show's director offered this sort of situation to illustrate the differences between the two male leads. As he tells it, there's a car wreck and two men are injured, one worse than the other; there's also a hospital some distance away. Lelouch, an "end justifies the means" type, would consider the factors, then take the man with less severe injuries to the hospital; that man lives, and Lelouch consoles himself over the other's death with the knowledge that at least he saved one person. Suzaku, a "means justifies the ends" type, would do his best to get both of them to the hospital, but they'd both die along the way; at first he'd curse his own weakness, but then he'd assuage himself by saying that he did the right thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Banner of the Stars</a></em> opens with a fierce battle which results in the main characters' ship being destroyed. It turns out it was a mock engagement. It wasn't technically unwinnable, but as Lafiel and her crew were far less experienced than their opponents, nobody thought they'd win and it's made clear there was no shame in losing (Lafiel still feels disappointed in herself regardless).
</li><li> The beginning episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls">Sky Girls</a></em> were built up in such a way that the three main characters believe they're part of an aerobatics team, even when they start eventually training with weapons. But one episode's simulator suddenly throws the thought-to-be-extinct WORMs into their routine flight training. With no training and the WORM's overwhelming firepower, none of the girls, not even the Eika with her military background, can defeat it. It isn't until two episodes later (on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a> no less) that their true purpose is revealed.
</li><li> The "Program" short in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnimatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnimatrix">The Animatrix</a></em> featured scenarios which test how a crewmate would respond if one of their own turned against them. In this case, Cis is informed by her partner Duo that he has betrayed the rebels and informed the machines of their location. Having locked the program so she can't escape, it's pretty much a lose-lose situation. She can kill him but be killed when the machines destroy her ship, be killed by him outright, or join him in betraying the humans.
</li><li> In episode 56 (The Ultimate Test) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, Ash and company (along with Team Rocket) take a Pokemon test that seems designed to be impossible. One of the questions shows a black circle and asks which Pokemon's silhouette it is. Most answer Voltorb or Electrode, as both are the only perfectly spherical Pokemon. Instead it's "a Jigglypuff seen from above".

The scenario was that the <em>Voyager</em> is attacked by a Borg Cube (complete with exterior shot), and Hazard Team is sent to plant explosives around the cube to distract them long enough for the Voyager to escape. During the attack, Munro falls into an assimilation chamber, where he finds an assimilated Foster. Not wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>, he fails.

The instructor demands to know how Starr would defeat him as an obvious prelude to inflicting such a beating on Starr. Starr responds him by shooting him in both knees and declaring that he has no intention to ever be unarmed. While it supposed to be an unwinnable situation, it was never officially sanctioned, so it can't even really be called a "simulation".
</li><li> In issue 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyMorphinPowerRangersBoomStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyMorphinPowerRangersBoomStudios">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (Boom!

Tommy, who's still dealing with the guilt of what he did while brainwashed, demands another go anyway.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Kobayashi Maru" training scenario, first seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>, is a seminal example, even referenced in other sci-fi works. It's a test of how a cadet responds to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">hopeless situation</a>. The <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> in this scenario is a freighter which has struck a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMines">Space Mine</a> and drifted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeutralZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeutralZone">The Neutral Zone</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Klingon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Federation</a> territories. The cadet receives the ship's distress call and is obliged to respond by Starfleet mandate, so ignoring it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">is not an option</a> — and the Klingons will likely kill the crew for "violating Klingon space". Any attempt to intervene, however, will cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">multiple Klingon ships</a> to attack the cadet and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">blow them to smithereens in under a minute</a>. The trick with the simulation is that the computer will generate as many ships as it needs to, as fast and powerful as they need to be, regardless of what reality or physics would dictate, to make sure you lose. But in spite of this, during the film we discover that Kirk <em>did</em> beat it — by hacking the simulation in advance and reprogramming it so that he could win. Strictly speaking, this was cheating, but his instructors at least appreciated his lateral thinking and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">refusal to give up</a>. It should also be noted that Kirk apparently took the test several times before he resorted to his unique solution; as he put it, he faced the scenario of being in a no-win situation several times, he simply refused to accept it.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse">Star Trek Novel Verse</a></em> has many many variations of the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> scenario, giving us insight into how the various ship captains think by showing their responses to the simulation.
<ul><li> Kirk is throughout acknowledged to be the only one ever to <em>beat</em> the scenario, and as in the films, it's because he stubbornly believes that there is no such thing as a no-win scenario and hacks the simulation to reflect that. Exactly why seems to vary between novels. Some claim he just didn't like the idea of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">cheating computer</a> who would test him on a scenario that by definition cannot occur in real life. Others claim he specifically hacked the computer so that the simulated Klingons would think of him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a> and actually be willing to negotiate, reflecting the reputation he hoped to cultivate for real (and to an extent did) — the semi-canonical novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> claim this as a basis for the test's later use as a lateral thinking puzzle. Still others give Kirk a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> and claim that his refusal to believe in a no-win scenario comes from his traumatic memories of the executions on Tarsus IV (seen in "Conscience of the King").
</li><li> Sulu goes the diplomatic route, staying out of the Neutral Zone, and leaves the <em>Maru</em> to its fate at the Klingons' hands. This is the most "correct" decision, but it's a tough decision to make nonetheless.
</li><li> Nog used his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Hat</a> and tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy">bribe the Klingons</a>.
</li><li> Chekov <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">self-destructed his ship</a>, but in the process killed everyone — his own crew, the Klingons, <em>and</em> the crew of the <em>Maru</em>.
</li><li> Scotty kept using his science chops to lock the simulation in an endless battle, as he responded to every one of the computer's impossible attacks (at one point it summoned more ships than existed in the entire Klingon fleet) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">physics tricks that worked only on paper</a>. He and the computer kept going for hours, and the examiners realized that the only way the computer could win was by waiting until Scotty just collapsed of exhaustion — which, at the rate Scotty was going, could take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">several days</a>. The examiners shut down the simulation, and Scotty protested that if he had access to a real engineering room, he could have beaten the simulation. This got him transferred to the Engineering Corps, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">was where he wanted to go all along</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Riker</a>, ever unpredictable, is alluded to have brought an EVA suit to the simulation so that he could fight the enemy ships <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAFistfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAFistfight">with his fists</a>.
</li><li> At least two characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage">blew up</a> the <em>Maru</em> themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">One</a> rationalized that it was very likely a trap, and if it wasn't, it was screwed to Hell anyway. The other proved to be completely apathetic to the <em>Maru</em>'s crew and saw the simulation as a fight with Klingons, using the ship's volatile crew to his advantage.
</li><li> Kirk's nephew Peter does a different simulation where the enemies are Romulans rather than Klingons, and he uses this to win the scenario by doing something that would work against Romulans but not Klingons — he challenges the enemy commander to single combat. In Romulan culture, such a formally declared challenge cannot be refused (on pain of death); the examiners cannot anticipate that Peter Kirk would even know this and assume he cheated like his uncle, but Spock explains the truth (it works on Vulcans too, as the practice predates the Vulcan-Romulan schism). This provides the distraction he needs to beam the <em>Maru</em>'s crew onto the <em>Enterprise</em>; how he himself fares is a different question.
<div class="indent"><strong>Peter Kirk:</strong> It's a no-win scenario, Mr. Spock, I'll give you that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">But only for me</a>.

She then uses the computer's power to run the entire simulated ship. This causes the simulation (and the computer back at HQ) to crash, preventing the Klingons from formally recording a final victory. The instructors call this a qualified tie and tell her not to do it again.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch">Star Trek: Enterprise Relaunch</a></em> novel depicts the origin of the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> scenario, which is <em>not</em> a simulation. It goes like the simulation does, but with the additional wrinkle that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the enemy ships have a device that can take remote control of his ship's systems</span>. Captain Archer ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having to flee and allow the <em>Maru</em> to be destroyed</span>.

In it, our student Actor is put into a VR simulation of Overworld, in the docks of the city of Ankhana, where he/she hears the sound of a woman being assaulted down a nearby alley by a single man. Those actors who confront the man will quickly find out that there are two others waiting on the low rooftops to jump some fool like you rushing to her aid. Even defeating all three won't do; the best student in the College, Kris Hansen, got that far only to be knifed by the woman, who is in on the charade. When Hari Michaelson, a Labour-caste near-dropout with terrible magick skills, enters the challenge, he becomes the first person in the history of the College to beat the simulation — not bothering with spells, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">he gets the jump on the first man</a>, KOs the other two before they can recover from jumping into the alley, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatisfiedStreetRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatisfiedStreetRat">knows better than to trust the woman</a>, who gets her throat cut when she tries to knife him. He only fails because the test expected him to use magick, and the instructor hacked the simulation to bring the other players back to life and beat him senseless, something that was never before needed for the Lakefront sim. Regardless, as the instructor points out, the real point of the test is to show whether the Actor-to-be can give the viewers an interesting death scene.

As in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, cockpit-shaped simulators are essential tools for fighter pilot training — but here, holographic and gravity-altering technology makes the simulations <em>much</em> more realistic.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelStackpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelStackpole">Michael Stackpole</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing: Rogue Squadron</a></em> opens with prospective Rogues training by playing the <em>Redemption</em> scenario, which is so infamously difficult that it's earned the in-universe nickname of the "<a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Redemption_scenario">Requiem scenario<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Four X-Wings are tasked with defending the corvette <em>Korolev</em> as it transfers wounded to the medical frigate <em>Redemption</em>, while an Imperial frigate pops in and out of the system launching waves of TIE Fighters and Bombers. The "by the book" strategy developed by pilots is for two X-Wings to engage the TIEs as they're launched while the other two stay behind to guard the corvette, otherwise the Imperial frigate joins the battle and make a terrible situation even worse. It's noted that "by the book" is not a particularly good strategy, as it leaves those actually fighting the TIEs outnumbered by a substantial margin, but since the Rebels are outnumbered and outgunned regardless, it's simply the least bad of the available choices. Corran Horn only wins the mission by taking out the more dangerous TIE Bombers with his proton torpedoes before finishing off the enemy fighters, and even then he lucks out after barely "surviving" a head-on engagement that damaged the last remaining TIE Fighter enough for a torpedo to catch up with it. The mission is based in-universe on a historical battle and out-of-universe on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing">X-Wing</a></em> flight sim.

Things go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> immediately so that the pilots are being attacked before their ships have even exited the hangar, and when they request orders, they find that Control has been "killed". It is, of course, a test to see how the pilots can improvise and survive a worst-case scenario, with the twist that each pilot's score is swapped with that of his or her wingman, for an additional lesson on the importance of teamwork. Then they change the scenario to mimic what happened to Myn Donos' first command, which was wiped out in an ambush; Donos is excused from it because of the trauma, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wraiths put him into it anyway to try and break his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a></span>.

Even as a simulation, the top pilot kept gunning down the compulsive pilot within seconds, but this pilot was pleased to note that he was lasting a couple seconds more than when he'd started. Later in the book, that same top pilot is said to have engaged in a practice fighter duel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills">Darth Vader</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">lasted about the same amount of time</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Almost <em>every</em> novel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> has simulator runs, some of which are indeed meant to be (nearly) unwinnable. More often than not, however, it is Honor Harrington herself who sets up the exercise:
<ul><li> <em>On Basilisk Station</em> contains probably the most notable example. Her ship is built as a testbed for a new "grav lance" that can only be fired (for all intents and purposes) at point-blank range. All the ship's non-melee weapons are removed to make room for the giant sucker punch. In the first exercise, she does manage to "kill" the flagship of the Manticoran fleet, but in all subsequent exercises her ship is singled out and destroyed as it tries to close. The weapon's developer would later admit that she knew that the weapon in question was impractical for actual combat, but she was overridden.
</li><li> When Harrington is on medical leave and instructing at Saganami Island, she arranges for selected cadets to participate in extracurricular simulations. When she plays the Opposing Force, the students pass if they somehow manage to <em>survive</em> the simulated battle. That's fair, as Harrington is universally recognized as one of the top naval commanders of her era, and her opponents are college-aged officer cadets.
</li><li> In <em>Echoes of Honor</em>, an admiral training the new LAC squadrons is opposed to the idea, so in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SabotageToDiscredit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SabotageToDiscredit">discredit the whole idea</a>, the simulations are arranged to be so unwinnable as to be ridiculous. Alice Truman, the officer in charge of the LACs, was so good at training them that they kept winning, and she picked up on the admiral's plan and insisted that her superiors find a way to fairly evaluate the LACs whatever they did.
</li><li> In one of the prequel books, Travis complains about a no-win scenario he was observing. He notes that the trainees lost to an Opposing Force armed with a weapon that was physically impossible to produce. He then goes on to explain exactly why this so-called "Multi-Drive Missile" could never be made, earning him the ire of the officer who came up with the simulation, as he'd been trying to get the funding to develop said MDM. While it was eventually developed, Admiral Sonja Hemphill had an additional 400 years of further R&amp;D to build on to make it practical, and even then one of Travis' objections — that an MDM would be significantly larger than a single-drive missile, and thus have a different sensor return — still applied.
</li></ul></li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland">Otherland</a></em>, the barbarian Thargor gets killed. Then we find out it was a virtual RPG and meet the kid playing Thargor. Still, Thargor's death is pretty traumatic, since in this MMORPG, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">a character's death is permanent</a> and the player had spent years grinding that character until he was the most powerful in the whole game.
</li><li> The first book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten">Sten</a></em> series has the title character put through one of these during his basic training ... but it's not really a test. Instead, by claiming he handled the situation badly, his superiors can pretend he's being washed out of training and kicked out of the service in disgrace. He's actually being transferred to Mantis Section, the elite commando force. Sten isn't told this in advance.
</li><li> Early in the novel <em>Gravity</em> by Tess Garritsenn, there is a scene of a catastrophic space-shuttle launch that turns out to be a simulation. A higher-up had expressed concern that the team members were overconfident, so the instructors tried to take them down a notch and remind them, "Disaster is not theoretical."
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Culture</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceDetail">Surface Detail</a></em>, a protagonist in an Orbital militia does one of these and complains that it serves no purpose.
</li><li> One of the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> books begins this way, with the Yeerks supposedly invading the Hork-Bajir valley. It's used to demonstrate how unprepared everyone is, especially with all the families hiding there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedMarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedMarsTrilogy">Red Mars</a></em>, Arkady Bogdanov is in charge of landing simulations for the <em>Ares</em>. He takes an inordinate amount of glee in "problem runs", making everyone groan when the announcement comes over the loudspeaker. The actual landing on Mars goes off without a hitch.
<div class="indent"><em>"Arkady has gone mad!" <br/>"He has </em>simulated<em> going mad."</em>
</div></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth-Quoted</a></em>, in which the opening scene (quickly revealed to be a training simulation) shows Skeeve being beleaguered by a chaotic and brutal mob of <em>reporters</em>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome">Cripples</a></em>, the protagonists are hired to "tame" the AI of a newly-built warship commissioned by a human colony. The colonists angered the Halflings, who built the ship, by haggling over the price, a big no-no in Halfling culture (since it devalues their work). So the Halflings found a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">loophole in their contract</a> and programmed the ship's AI to reject the commands of any crew which it finds "unworthy". The only way to prove a crew's worthiness is to resolve a critical situation in a way that the AI would never be able to do. Nothing they do works — including a successful completion of a dangerous mission to destroy several powerful robotic ships left to guard a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> (because they needed a local human colony's help to do it) — until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist coaxes the ubiquitous rats on the ship to chew through enough cables to permanently damage the AI</span>. The AI finally considers the crew "worthy".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekRobinson">Derek Robinson</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HulloRussiaGoodbyeEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HulloRussiaGoodbyeEngland">Hullo Russia, Goodbye England</a></em> contains one based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> in the RAF: A flight simulator of a Vulcan jet bomber, tasked with delivering Britain's nuclear deterrent to the Soviet Union, creates a long and horrible sequence in which everything goes wrong. And that's <em>everything</em> — the bomb arms itself prematurely, or it jams in the bomb-bay with the clock ticking down to detonation, or Russian countermeasures show up and attack, or they fly too close to a nuclear explosion from a different aircraft, or the aircraft itself develops escalating mechanical problems. The test itself is unwinnable and designed to test the aircrews to the limit, weeding out those who prove to be indecisive.
</li><li> The main character of the Larry Bond novel <em>Cold Choices</em> starts the book in one — he and his crew are in a simulated submarine that is springing leaks, and the leaks get bigger and bigger as time goes by. Everyone going in knows that it's unwinnable — the people running the tests will just keep adding more leaks and pumping in more water until the compartment floods. The test is about their ability to keep their heads straight and continue to fight for their lives in a highly stressful and uncomfortable situation, and they are graded by how long they are able to delay the inevitable.

Of course, nobody bothers to tell her it's a simulation the first time, so for her the trope is in effect like she's in the audience until she fails and sees her friend die before the simulation resets.

The point is to emphasize that bridge officers are in charge of a ship with hundreds, if not thousands of people, and that (as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">The Wrath of Khan</a></em> once famously put it), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">lives of the many</a> outweigh the lives of the few, or the one</span> — even if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that "one" is one of your closest friends</span>. Troi can't overcome this, and Riker has to reject her:

I cannot let any bridge officer serve who's not qualified. I'm sorry.
</div><ul><li> In "Coming of Age", we see Wesley Crusher in a simluation where an "accident" leaves two technicians trapped in a room that would soon fill with radiation, and Wesley can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">only save one of them</a>. One is too injured to move on his own, and the other is too terrified to move on his own. Wesley chooses to save the injured man. Unlike the <em>Maru</em> scenario, this is just for entrance to Starfleet Academy, and it's tailored specifically to Wesley's greatest fear — which is why it's the exact scenario by which Picard had to leave Wesley's father (and his best friend) to die on an away mission.
</li><li> In "Chain of Command", Picard, Crusher, and Worf simulate storming a Cardassian base as preparation for the real thing. They program the holodeck to prepare for every eventuality, but in the field they still walk right into a trap.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "The Magnificent Ferengi", the Ferengi are attempting to rescue Quark and Rom's mother, and fail so miserably that one of her rescuers shoots her. Then it's revealed to be a holosuite simulation, in preparation for the real thing. And it's still on easy mode; they just suck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> is so guilty of showing someone dying in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpen">Batman Cold Open</a> and then revealing it to be a simulation that you could make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame">Drinking Game</a> out of it:

</li><li> In "Worst Case Scenario", Tuvok provides an interesting twist: he made a "Maquis Rebellion Scenario" simulation but never finished it, since he saw the Maquis as having so few problems fitting in that it would never be likely to even happen. Paris happens upon it, and he and the crew have so much fun playing with it that they pressure Tuvok to complete it. However, Tuvok and Paris then find that former Maquis Seska (who had defected to the Kazon) discovered it and rigged it to be a true no-win scenario with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a> — and with the safeties disabled, meaning they could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. The bridge crew couldn't shut it down quickly, but they did have access to the writing interface, allowing Janeway to write herself in as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> until they could turn it off.
</li><li> "Threshold" starts off with Tom Paris trying to break the Warp 10 limit in a shuttle. As he reaches Warp 9.95, the nacelles are ripped off and the shuttle explodes. Paris appears sitting on the holodeck floor, and B'Elanna Torres tells him he's dead. How they were able to program a simulation for what would happen at Warp 10 without any data on what happens when you approach Warp 10 is unclear, but this episode is infamous and that's the least of its problems.
</li><li> In "Learning Curves", Tuvok administers a battle simulation test to a group of Maquis crewmen. The attack ends with the simulated <em>Voyager</em> going down in flames, all phasers blazing. When the test ends, the trainees believe they were facing an unwinnable scenario (obliquely referencing the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em>), but Tuvok did program in a winning condition: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalWithdrawal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalWithdrawal">retreat</a>. Aside from the outcome of the battle, there was nothing at stake, so there was no reason not to withdraw and live to fight another day. It's distinct from the <em>Maru</em> simulation in that the latter included a distress call that Starfleet officers are duty-bound to respond to.

True to form, Tuvok is there to tell you what a sorry excuse for a Starfleet officer you are. Even worse, he tells you, as you board the turbolift, to consider the scenario to be your personal Kobayashi Maru.
</li><li> <em>Starfleet Academy</em> games tend to have the actual Kobayashi Maru as a level.

<ul><li> In the SNES version, the only way to get the Kirk ending was to play <em>as</em> Kirk — by inputting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode">Cheat Code</a> at the name selection menu (you could only select from a limited amount of preexisting names), enabling you to name your cadet "James T.

The Martian Manhunter put the team in a psychic simulation in which alien invaders killed the entire Justice League, as a test to see how the team would react to catastrophe without the League's guidance. However, upon seeing Artemis "die", M'gann inadvertently took control of the simulation and made the entire team think it was real, not only plunging everyone into extreme trauma, but also nearly trapping everyone who "died" in a coma. No matter what, winning was completely impossible. No matter what they did, the situation would continue to get worse and worse until they failed. Even when Martian Manhunter entered the simulation to regain control and end it, he forgot that it was fake, and only remembered when everyone but M'gann had been "killed".

<ul><li> US Navy and Coast Guard ships periodically undergo a 2-week long evaluation period where the crew completes various drills to simulate a whole range of routine and emergency scenarios. The "final exam" drill is designed to be impossible to pass. No matter how well the crew performs, the situation just keeps getting worse and worse until an abandon ship order has to be given. The idea is to see how long the crew can hold out in a worst-case scenario where there's no possible way to save the ship. Unlike many other examples of this trope, it serves a purpose beyond "see how they handle failure": keeping a dying ship afloat as long as possible gives the crew the best possible chance for a timely rescue and (hopefully) minimizes the loss of life.
</li><li> Part of a typical NASA Astronaut's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> involves dealing with emergencies in a simulator, though in this case the scenarios used have obscure or complicated solutions, as opposed to no solution at all. The idea here is training the astronauts in Olympic-standard mental gymnastics rather than training them to face death stoically. The latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan">part of the job description</a> anyway.
<ul><li> In the early days of Gemini and Apollo, NASA initially had a specific rule against these sorts of training situations, thinking that it would hurt morale to no avail if there was no actual answer. After Apollo 13, it was realized that the situation faced by the crew would have been rejected as impossible. Since that time, this rule was removed, and several unwinnable scenarios have actually been beaten by creativity and ingenuity.
</li><li> A released audio segment depicting the training for the Space Shuttle's earliest available abort mode, RTLS (Return To Launch Site), was this. Engine 1 (the center engine) failed approximately 30 seconds after liftoff. The trainers were sporting enough to wait until after the shuttle had gotten some return velocity to Kennedy Space Center (but not enough) before killing Engine 2 (the starboard engine) - mostly because the Shuttle's response to losing two engines during the powered pitch-around maneuver would be to drop directly into the Atlantic Ocean. Engine 3 died shortly before fuel exhaustion, leaving a contingency abort (essentially, ditching the shuttle as close to land as possible and abandoning ship via the mid-deck) the only remaining option. It's easy to tell why the astronauts who flew the Shuttle never, ever wanted to actually <em>use</em> the RTLS abort in a mission (fortunately, the only abort mode ever used was abort-to-orbit, used on <em>Challenger</em>'s 8th mission).
</li></ul></li><li> Various training simulations for prospective pilots involve the instructor randomly turning things off in order to simulate piloting a heavily damaged or malfunctioning plane. If the instructor so wishes, he can "break" so many of the plane's functions that all the pilot can hope for is a crash landing with a slim possibility of passenger survival. The latter is almost <em>never</em> done in simulator training, however, as the possibility is remote and simulator time is expensive. Training simulations typically have <em>one</em> failure occur at a time - which, depending on your view, leaves pilots woefully underprepared for a worst-case, real-world cascading failure scenario. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIeQG32v6Q">Captain Sullenberger, who landed the Miracle on the Hudson, gives his take.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A similar thing is occasionally done in military exercises — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">exercise coordinator</a> might at one point say: "Blue Team, your SAMs no longer work", or "OpFor, your fuel dump has been destroyed," so as to train participants to adapt when plans fall apart.
<ul><li> The same thing occurs during command training exercises for civilian disaster response: it's typical for the organizers to arbitrarily declare that a given response has failed in order to make the situation worse, or that <em>another</em> situation has sprung up while the agency which would normally deal with it is fully occupied with the first incident.
</li><li> And if all else fails, point to the guy making all the decisions and say "You're dead," then point to the next guy and say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">So what do you do?</a>"
</li></ul></li><li> Training for EMTs and ER personnel often forces them to deal with training scenarios where they have to save a patient and everything going wrong and the patient dying on them, or they do everything correctly and the patient <em>still</em> dies. The entire point of the scenarios is to drive home the fact that they <em>will</em> eventually fail to save a patient and that some of the reasons are outside of their control, but they still have to try.
</li><li> A fairly common practice after a particularly notable air disaster involving some kind of failure of the aircraft is to program a simulator with the scenario, put experienced pilots in the cockpit, and see if there was anything at all that could have been done. Even if the test pilots know what's coming, it's not unusual for it to be demonstrated to be utterly impossible to have saved the aircraft. In cases of <em>near</em> disaster, running the simulation often shows how ridiculously lucky and/or skilled the original pilots were to have pulled off what they did.
</li><li> A standard feature for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> contestant tryouts. For example, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleDare1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleDare1986">Double Dare (1986)</a></em>, contestant duos would be asked trivia questions and then told an answer given was wrong. This was done to see what sort of reaction happened, such as if the contestants argued with each other or disputed the answer being wrong. The producers of Double Dare wanted to make sure they had contestants who worked together as teams and were good sports.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in the most awful way during the US military's Millenium Challenge 2002 war game. The goal was to demonstrate and test new military technologies in a simulated Persian gulf war situation, especially relevant given the year. The official factions were merely Red and Blue, with Blue being the USA and Red being either Iraq or Iran. Red Team was commanded by Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, and was expected to lose for a multitude of reasons, including tech and manpower. Riper proceeded to use motorcycle messengers and light signals to operate off the grid of all the new fangled tech, leaving Blue unable to anticipate their movements. Blue demanded their surrender as a show of force, with a 24 hour time limit. This allowed Riper to also know when they were to be attacked, so he ordered a pre-emptive cruise missile strike that, were it real, would have had a death toll of over 20,000 troops. This also shut down their electronics and "sunk" numerous ships, including one aircraft carrier and ten cruisers. Most of what was left of Blue's Navy was then sunk by a wave of "suicide bombers". Then the military suspended the exercise, reset it, put a ton of artificial rules in about what Riper was and wasn't allowed to do and even required him to give them intel on Red's forces, forbid him from using some weapons and required them to not attack at certain times. The "training exercise" as the military put it was nothing more than security theater, absolute pageantry for the display of new tech, rather than anything for actual training, despite that most assuredly not being what it was meant to be. Given a no-win situation, Riper won. Embarrassed that old fashioned tactics could easily humiliate their new tech, they forced it from "unlikely" to "impossible" so they could get the desired result. Of course, history would show that unlike in the wargame, they couldn't do that in the actual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Asymmetrical warfare was shown to be a significant threat and going low tech could beat high tech, something they could have adapted to and planned for if not for the pride of certain individuals making them refuse to accept their no-win situation had been beat, which got many people killed in the long run.
