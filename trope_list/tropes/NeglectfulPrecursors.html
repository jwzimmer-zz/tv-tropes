<ul><li> A brief has been filed by the Kindgom of Astimata on behalf of the protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/UndefeatedBahamutChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/UndefeatedBahamutChronicle">Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle</a></em>. The, yet unnamed, race responsible for littering the continent, if not the planet, with numerous ruins, seven of which have been found and documented, left these structures mostly intact, only being damaged by the ravages of time. Inside these structures are large numbers of feral living weapons that attack any nearby humans with indiscriminate fury, killing them for sport, and should the humans somehow manage to defeat them, breeding chambers have been found within (at least in episode 8 of the anime continuity) which simply replace them. Absolutely no signage or warning of any kind is placed around these structures, the only documentation exists <em>inside</em> them. Furthermore, the only truly effective way to fight these monstrosities is the advanced, and long forgotten, weaponry and technology found within said structures, with little, if any, instructions in its use, leading to horrific, and unwilling, human experimentation, and at least one case of a massive living weapon of mass destruction, the Abyss Ragnarok being unleashed and wiping out numerous countries, and at least one case of a "ruins" structure itself being used as a weapon of mass-murder, by Hayes, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> that the ruin's own internal systems recognized as being a blood descendant of said race. In addition, a lower-tier member of said race, Krulcifer, was also once found inside one of these structures with absolutely no idea of her heritage, or any information regarding these structures, except what she could get her own hands on, and discovered, purely by accident, that she's an "administrator" which can bypass certain security measures but would still be attacked by the living weapons mentioned above.
</li><li> The prosecution would like to submit to the court the cases of a number of humans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> where-in they become Neglectful Precursors of much stronger beings than they are themselves. Because of bad initial appearance they dump their creations, which made them hate humanity or seek a very cruel ways to become humans, made worse when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> helps them survive and gain power by feeding them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Philosopher's Stones</a>.
</li><li> Your Honor, I bring before the court the case of Al-Hazard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>. The defendant is charged with the creation of no less than <em>twenty-one</em> 'Jewel Seed' Lost Logia with a combined output capable of fracturing reality, with an ease of use even a <em>child</em> could use. They also stand accused of the creation of a fully armed inter-dimensional warship complete with an army of drone weaponry.
<ul><li> The defendant wishes to state for the record that said warship was not of their creation, but rather the creation of the Belkan Empire. Additionally, the defendant takes no responsibility for Belka's other major blunder, namely the artificial eldritch abomination known as the Book of Darkness.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Your Honor, I would like to mention the Unnamed Aliens from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappySeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappySeven">Happy Seven</a></em>. They were fighting so much they created a super weapon strong enough to blow up the universe, hid it inside Earth, then left. And, then they waited till there was actually less than 5 minutes left to decide to come stop the machine.
</li><li> The prosecution presents it case against Humanity in the manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hotel">Hotel</a></em>. Humanity are precursors to the sentient computers, one (Louis) whose task is to ensure that the DNA of all Earth life is protected and a second who's task is to protect the DNA of humans in order to colonize another world in hopes of saving the species. While the creations of Louis may or may not be independent sentient robots separate from itself the creation of his counterpart in space certainly are ... we're assholes who did nothing but cause Earth to die and died in the process ourselves leaving Earth an unlivable wasteland.
</li><li> In the case of The People V. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humanity</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>. It engineered a vast, <em>vast</em> number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a>, which include the titanic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">cyborg-like God Warriors</a>, destroyed the entire ecosystem of the whole world, and finally all but perished in the Seven Days Of Fire. But its greatest sin was to create <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Heart of Shuwa</span>, a biological <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">computer which contains a human-like consciousness,</span> and which, when found by the few surviving humans, dispensed just enough scientific knowledge to enthrall them. Additionally, war technology pre-Seven Days Of Fire is still scattered across the planet, including the aforementioned God Warriors.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The prosecution submits the case of the Celestials of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> to the court's attention. Let it be known that the Celestials did willingly tinker with humanity's genes, creating the Eternals and the Deviants, as well as sticking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Gene</a> into humanity's genetic mix. They also happened to leave behind one of their advanced spaceships where it would be found by En Sabah Nur, one of the first mutants resulting from the X-Gene. One can guess at the sort of use he put the Celestials' technology to by the fact that he renamed himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Apocalypse</a>. Then it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they <em>let</em> En Sabah Nur nick their stuff so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">he would owe them a favor</a></span>, heedless of the consequences. In another case, the Celestials deemed the Terminex unfit for further evolution and wiped them out, they did not see fit to finish the job and let the Terminus project they left behind alone. This resulted in the destruction of entire ecosystems in numerous galaxies and may have been the end of life as we know it on Earth if not for the efforts of the Fantastic Four. For added kicks, the Terminus project only began in response to Celestial aggression in the first place and would have taken a trivial amount of effort for them to put an end to.
</li><li> Your Honor, I present to the Court the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Guardians of the Universe</a> — while it <em>is</em> true they created the intergalactic police force now known as the Green Lantern Corps, and that they have had a major role in the defeat of the Anti-Monitor, Superboy-Prime and Mandrakk the Dark Monitor, there has been an ever growing list of incidents which leads the prosecution to wonder exactly what is it that the Guardians have been doing with that power.
<ul><li> For starters, the Court is presented with evidence of the Guardians' creation of the Psions. They were given immeasurably powerful technology and isolated from the universe at large so they could strive to comprehend it without interference. Except the Psions have done just that, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a> in which they discover their origins, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Go Mad from the Revelation</a> that their entire existence is an experiment, destroy all technology, and start anew. Furthermore, the path the Guardians set the Psions on has arguably pushed them into a spiral of abuse of other species, creating a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>.
</li><li> The Guardians covered up the crimes of a rogue member of their collective, one Krona, namely: reprogramming and unleashing the berserk Manhunters on Sector 666, which ended in nigh-complete genocide; destroying entire universes in his mad quest to know of their creation; manipulation of the Emotional Entities; first contact with Nekron; and pouring entropy into the newborn universe, dramatically shortening its lifespan <em>and creating the Anti-Monitor</em>.
</li><li> The Guardians, in fact, have a noted record for hiding the records of their past failures, even though knowledge of this could prove critical in eventually saving the Universe as a whole, to make themselves look not completely terrible and/or incompetent. Examples of this include the sealed Apokolips campaign (in which hundreds if not thousands of Lanterns were slaughtered against Parademons), the existence of the Parallax Fear Entity (which led to the destruction of the Corps and the near-death of the universe), and most egregiously, the smear campaign against Abin Sur and Ganthet and the sealed records pertaining to the truth about Nekron and the prophecy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a>, in which they <em>continuously</em> suppressed vital information and fomented discord within the seven Corps, which were all vital in the banishment of Krona and the end of the Blackest Night.
</li><li> When questioned by the abomination Nekron, a Guardian was asked exactly why his people had chosen to patrol the cosmos. His answer — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "I don't remember".</span> — only serves to underpin how far the Guardians have strayed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For the record, it was to atone for Krona's actions, though they quickly became enchanted with the idea of establishing themselves as the <em>de facto</em> authorities of the universe.</span>
</li><li> In another earlier case, the Guardians chose to sentence one of their own, Appa Ali Apsa, to mortality and exile because he had decided to preserve the life of one Green Lantern over preserving the environment in a clear Catch 22 situation. While he eventually regains his immortality, Appa Ali Apsa's experiences as a result of his exile are one of the chief reasons he subsequently goes mad and brings in various cities from across the universe to use as his playthings, crossing the line himself into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursor.</a> Interestingly, their hypocrisy becomes more notable when earlier they elected <em>not</em> to strip the above-mentioned Krona of his own immortality after his repeated crossings of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, leading to <em>much</em> further misery.
</li><li> After corraling much of the universe's mystical energy into the Starheart (mainly because they feared magic and wanted to eliminate it so they and their Green Lanterns could better police the universe), they failed to keep it properly contained, creating a dangerous abomination with a serious grudge against them.

This species, alleged to have long been in peaceful contact with said whales, equipped their probe with the capacity to communicate with these creatures underwater... and to <em>decimate</em> Earth's indigenous ecosystems, in the event that the whales failed to respond. Even if the probe's makers were unaware that whales were not Earth's only sentient residents, such environmental sabotage is reckless and unconscionable. Moreover, if the whales' language were to <em>change</em> in the millennia between one probe's visitation and the next, rendering them incapable of a coherent response, then the probe's "peaceful communication" might well have exterminated the humpback species long before humans could do so! Your Honor, I submit a charge of reckless endangerment on behalf of plaintiffs George and Gracie, and of negligent homicide on behalf of other Earth life forms killed by the probe's transmissions.
<ul><li> Also to be tried in absentia: the "Ancient Ones" of Altamid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond">Star Trek Beyond</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> Your honour, my clients, the species known as 'homo sapiens or humanity' wish to file charges against the species known only as 'engineers' as portrayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus">Prometheus</a></em>. Having created humanity through an unsupervised and uncontrolled genetic experiment, these engineers then left clues as to their location on humanity's homeworld. When humans followed these clues, they became the victims of advanced bio-weapons that had been left lying about by the engineers in clear violation of basic safety regulations. Furthermore, the engineers are responsible for the creation of the species known as 'xenomorph', which presents a clear and present danger to all those who encounter it and can be found in multiple locations around the galaxy as a direct result of poor oversight.

Eventually they discover this, after which they then proceed to cause a energy cascade that wipes out their entire race, just to destroy the incredibly dangerous gates. Unfortunately, one survives and is copied to create another network by a second precursor race who are almost wiped out warring with each other over whether the gates are dangerous or not. The last member of said race is the titular Morgaine, who embarks on a million-year journey to close all the gates. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some others remain trapped on worlds as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>, and these fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a> as they typically run slave empires.</span>

Such reckless behaviour cannot be tolerated, and an example must be set. Humanity is now a wolfling species and will likely die out within the next few thousand years, given galactic dogma against such species.
</li><li> Every last sapient species and subspecies descended from deserted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Pak Breeders</a> have had more than sufficient cause to look up exactly how much it would cost them to head to the Core and sue Pak Protectors for their shoddy long term social engineering projects.

Even though it turns out the Consu consider lacking consciousness to be an ideal state of being, the fact that they never told the Obin this little fact, and treated the Obin like a bunch of irritating insects who should stop asking questions definitely qualifies them as neglectful.</span>
</li><li> Your Honor, the prosecution would also bring suit against several culprits from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em>:
<ul><li> First, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">T'lan Imass.</a> Their ritual sealing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">captured Jaghut</a> and Forkrul Assail proved ineffective in the long-term as any person with sufficient strength and interest could remove the rock and thus release the trapped being. In addition, their actions directly contributed to the destruction of magic at various locations around the world, which continues to this day.
</li><li> The Jaghut themselves weren't slacking off either. Known for having created some other races just for fun (they didn't need them for anything in particular), some of those sentient or semi-sentient killing machines (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Boles, the Nachts</span>), they then just up and left them to do whatever they pleased, which includes looking for new things to hate and kill because, well, that's what they do best.
</li><li> And not to forget the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azathanai,</span> who can be credited for creating most of the known races in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">Malazanverse.</a> Some still have some connection to whatever race they created, but some simply don't care anymore or think their creations deserve what they get.
</li></ul></li><li> Your Honor, the prosecution would like to bring suit against the Heechee of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga">Heechee Saga</a></em>, who are responsible for leaving behind advanced technology when fleeing from the Assassins, which was bound to be found by a younger race and, without proper instructions on the use, would likely end up misusing it to disastrous ends. Furthermore, the continuous use of said technology is what attracted the attention of the Assassins toward the Heechee in the first place, which means that, by leaving such technology for anyone to use, the Heechee have doomed an unfortunate young race (namely, humanity) to extinction.
</li><li> Your Honor, the prosecution respectfully wishes in indict The Great Old Ones from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> saga. These precursors left incredibly dangerous artifacts which regularly killed and maimed the people of Mid-World.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanithLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanithLee">Tanith Lee</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromTheFlatEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromTheFlatEarth">Tales from the Flat Earth</a></em>, the Gods created the universe, got bored with it, and now do nothing but stand around contemplating their own greatness. They've intervened in the world approximately three times in all of history, each of which was to deliver smack-downs on anyone who dared to challenge them.
</li><li> If it pleases the court, the plaintiff will now present exhibit A from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em>, which documents the decision by Swift Kick, Inc, a notoriously shoddy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenesisEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenesisEffect">planetary construction firm</a>, to shave off costs by making life on Earth mortal, including all possible sentient life forms arising on the planet.
</li><li> Your honor, while the Aldenata of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PosleenWarSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PosleenWarSeries">Posleen War Series</a></em> are already charged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">abuse</a> in conscripting the Posleen as soldiers, additional charges of neglect and reckless endangerment have been brought against them. Nearly every sentient species suffers from one genetic anomaly or another that has caused their race great distress. In example I present the Posleen once again, a race recklessly modified in such a way that their need for food far exceeds the ability of any planet to provide a stable supply. The many worlds left stripped of life and irradiated by the Posleen's nuclear wars are as much the fault of the Aldenata as the Posleen.
<ul><li> For corroborating evidence, I would like to introduce the Darheel, a species of predator that is no longer capable of consuming meat, which has led to species-wide mental problems and the Indowy who have for all intents and purposes been condemned to slavery owing to a genetically induced inability to stand up for themselves either mentally or physically.
</li></ul></li><li> Your Honour, the prosecution would like to indict the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RelicMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RelicMaster">Makers of Anara</a> for flagrant violation of their research ethics guidelines, irresponsible tampering with an entire biosphere with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> results, abandoning all the other inhabitants of Anara, creation of a biologically immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> which promptly proceeded to try and take over the world, and failure to ensure that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">weather and climate control machines</a> had failsafes, thereby threatening the safety and security of the planet's entire population due to their inevitable degradation.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Stargate Verse </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Your Honor, for unbelievable negligence, incredible incompetence, blinding hypocrisy, and a refusal to take any responsiblity at all for crimes, misdemeanors, or even basic sapient decency, the prosecution requests that The Ancients of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a> be assessed the maximum civil and criminal penalties available under the law. A summary of their deeds and lack thereof is as follows:
<ol><li> Refuse to help normal people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascend</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> save on their own merits, and punish those who do. Fair enough, but they also won't allow <em>anyone</em> who ascends to help mortals, bringing down the banhammer at the slightest sign of rule-breaking.
</li><li> Refuse to help any of the "lower beings" <em>at all</em>, including against monstrous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> beings that will kill or enslave everything in their path. Which is EXTREMELY hypocritical considering they're directly or indirectly responsible for the creation of almost all of them in the first place. Anyone of their kind that <em>does</em> attempt to help are treated <em>worse</em> than those that attempt to help them ascend. Witness: Daniel Jackson.
</li><li> Rarely took security measures (and almost never left instructions) regarding the <em>legions</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointlessDoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointlessDoomsdayDevice">Pointless Doomsday Devices</a> they left like so much trash throughout various galaxies including one capable of exterminating all life in the galaxy and another that could not be shut off once activated.
</li><li> Leaving other technologies throughout the galaxy, including a means of achieving immortality that causes insanity if used, to be exploited by anyone who discovered them. This resulted in the Goa'uld transforming from a simple parasitic species to the tyrannical rulers of the entire Milky Way Galaxy.
</li><li> Directly responsible for the creation of <strong>two</strong> horribly powerful, ravenous, immensely destructive beings (the Pegasus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Replicators</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">Wraith</a>). After exterminating their mistakes, they chose to ascend. Rather than use their ascended knowledge to fix the problems they had created they left their monstrous creations to slaughter countless millions of lives.
<ul><li> Your Honor, I must note that <a class="urllink" href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis:_Legacy:_Secrets">important evidence has recently emerged<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with regard to the creation of the Wraith. It has come the prosecution's attention that the Wraith came about due to an experiment to achieve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">Immortality</a>. Unwilling to test the process on themselves or their fellow Ancients, the researchers instead used a "lesser" species: humans. The majority of the test subjects did not survive the transformation. When it became clear that the survivors could only sustain themselves by feeding on the life force of humans or (more importantly in the researchers' eyes) Ancients, they imprisoned the newly-created Wraith and planned their extermination, which was prevented by the Wraith escaping and killing their captors. The Wraith Queen Alabaster and Teyla Emmagan, descended from human-Wraith hybridization experiments, can both testify to genetic memories of these events. The Wraith Old One is the only known survivor of the original Wraith and could also confirm through firsthand knowledge, but is unlikely to recognize the validity of this court and more likely to see it as a snack.
</li><li> It should also be noted that, in their war with the Wraith that lasted thousands of years, the Ancients with all of their superior technology never bothered to look for a way for Wraith and humans to coexist. Yet in a matter of mere years, a combined research group of Tau'ri and Wraith have developed an experimental retrovirus that allows a human to be fed upon by a Wraith without any permanent damage at all. Preliminary field tests have demonstrated that it works in at least some humans, with wider trials planned in the immediate future. Not only that, but some were able to genetically modify Wraith so they need not feed on humans at all. Had the Ancients been willing to even consider possibilities other than a war of extermination, billions of lives could well have been saved.
</li></ul></li><li> Intentionally created, in the Pegasus Galaxy, Stargates that terminate in orbit around planets without including a warning system. In fairness, sometimes even the gates on planets opened into environments that had become non-survivable in the intervening centuries, and of course hostile beings may lie in wait at other gates, so anyone with a lick of sense will send a probe through first.
</li><li> One of the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> beings managed to ascend and attempted to use the Ancient knowledge for his own benefit. Because his ascension had been aided by another the Ancients responded by only partially de-ascending him, leaving him with all of his knowledge (as well as being effectively unkillable).
<ul><li> This was done purely for a petty guilt trip on the person who had ascended him. Even if her decision was wrong they allowed Anubis to kill millions of innocent people not only without restraint but with their <em>explicit protection</em>. Effectively setting a murderer loose in a building full of helpless children and then preventing anyone from stopping the killing, putatively to teach a moral lesson.
</li><li> It does deserve to be pointed out here that when Daniel asked Oma Desala who the other people in the space-diner were, and if they were Ancients, she replied that "some of them" were, but not all. From this, it's relatively simple to note that the Ancients were only <em>one</em> group among the "Others" and are entirely plausibly neither the most numerous nor the oldest of them.
</li></ul></li><li> The justification given for their constant absence is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">not wanting to involve themselves with mortal affairs</a>, believing they do not possess the right to wield such power in such a way. Yet when the Ori, beings comparable to the Ancients to whom they should have no such restrictions, set their sights on the Milky Way galaxy they are allowed to just waltz in on a technicality. In addition, they are perfectly willing to break this non-interference clause when <em>their own</em> well-being is at stake, sending Morgan Le Fay to stop Merlin (who at the time was descended and should have been out-of-bounds) when he made a device capable of killing ascended beings.
</li><li> The Morgan Le Fay case bears further elaboration, as she very carefully leaked information to the humans, while the rest of the Ancients watched her. The moment she tried to do anything but be vague, she was dragged away, never to be seen again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At least until the Ancients needed her again.</span>
</li><li> The primary aspect of the Ancients non-interference pact is long as there are no ascended powers being used. That seems reasonable. Yet when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adria fully ascended, and later came down to our lowly plane of existence and acted with her full powers, did the Ancients finally stand up and say, "No"?</span> Well, no. While <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adria</span> returned to the Ori galaxy and never returned to the Milky Way afterwards, thus the Ancients were still playing by their (pompous, overblown, immoral) rules, the very fact that their rules allow for such a loophole merely strengthens the case against them.
</li><li> Decided to ignore any and all precautions regarding the safeguard of their technology, or leave any kind of warning regarding their technology, even when clearly having the power to manipulate the physical environment to do so. This extends to the Ancient Library of Knowledge and the Destiny Chair, both of which are designed so that if the users aren't pure Ancient, it kills them.
<ul><li> The defense would remind the prosecution that's what the ATA gene was for: locking out access to their technology for any non-Ancients. Dr. Rush does say in <em>Universe</em> that the ship <em>Destiny</em> pre-dates the ATA gene and genetic locks, so it's clearly something they added later on, perhaps for that very purpose (security). Unfortunately, that didn't stop sufficiently determined societies from getting around the locks (if you build it, somebody's going to find a way to tear it down), and the presence of the gene in a subset of the human population is thanks to a couple of post-Atlantis Ancients "getting frisky" during their brief time back in the Milky Way before ascending.
</li></ul></li><li> Furthermore, there is evidence that the Ancients were effectively incompetent, as they a) were not able to cure a plague which a Goa'uld symbiote is able to cure with no side effects, b) were not able to utilize their own technology to go back into time, instead creating a time loop/trap for other races to discover, c) were not able to defeat either the Wraith or the Replicators even though the "primitive" Tau'ri were able to, and d) were not able to hold Atlantis after being given control of it back again, because of their arrogance and general incompetence.
<ul><li> The defense argues point #3 also applies to the Asgard vis-a-vis the Replicators, and #4 is the fault of Rodney McKay editing the Asuran base code, thereby allowing them to edit it themselves and remove the restriction on attacking their creators.
</li><li> They appear to have laws against theoretical research or practical results of time travel, discussed in one of the <em>Atlantis</em> episodes when Weir went back in time.
</li><li> They left a time travelling puddle jumper on Atlantis. Even if they lock Atlantis and the Jumpers from activation by those without the Ancient gene, they have no idea what might happen to the city in the future which could have included the time jumper making it's way to the surface and being discovered by anyone. In a universe where meddling with time travel can drastically alter history <em>AND</em> existence being in a multiverse, this is a horrifyingly stupid technology to leave hanging around.
</li></ul></li><li> Allowed one of their number (Orlin) to give advanced weaponry to a civilization attempting to defend itself against the Goa'uld — said civilization then proceeded to use this technology to plot conquest against other worlds. Then acted to prevent this aggression by committing genocide against said civilization. While leaving the advanced weaponry <em>intact</em>, thereby providing themselves with an excuse to murder any <em>other</em> race curious enough to try activating it.
</li><li> So, the prosecution suggests we extend the verdict to Guilty, guilty, hypocritical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> scumbags. Thankfully, the Ancients turned out to be <em>so</em> neglectful they actually left behind the keys to creating the sangra'al, a device capable of destroying <em>themselves</em>. All in favor of capital punishment?
</li></ol></li><li> The Defense would like to point out that the reason the Ancients didn't fight the Ori or Adria was that they were in fact more powerful than the Ancients. It is stated that any human who believes in the Ori makes them more powerful on the ascended plane. As the series went on the population of the ENTIRE Ori galaxy and a large portion of the Milky Way was helping the Ori, and all that power switches from being split by a whole race to concentrated in one single being. It would've been frankly suicidal for the Ancients to directly intervene, but letting SG-1 fight in their own way kept the focus away from themselves. Also, why would the Ori need to cheat and create a human with some Ori powers that wasn't ascended? Because the Ancients were preventing them from intervening directly, which would have been a thousand times worse. <br/><br/>The convenient (alleged) banishment of Morgan Le Fey (a powerful Ascended Ancient) to the galaxy wherein lived the Ori, conveniently accompanying SG-1 through the Supergate, conveniently being present to heal Teal'c of mortal injury, conveniently giving Daniel Jackson the knowledge and means to sever Adria's power, and conveniently being on-hand to destroy her once her power had been severed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">all while sticking exactly to the letter of their rules</a>, should not be ignored.

Your Honor, I hereby move that they be found <strong>guilty</strong> not only of neglectful actions to their <strong>distant</strong> descendants but also guilty of neglectful actions to their <strong>immediate</strong> descendants as well.
<ol><li> An <em>amicus curiae</em> brief has been filed by council representing Gaius Baltar advising the court that, in the event that the opportunity arises to breed with <em>anything</em> that may end up dooming humanity, Baltar will volunteer to test this to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">satisfaction</a></em> of the court.
</li><li> A point of order has been brought before the court. While Adama mentions that the natives were tested for genetic compatibility before the "back up plan" was even possibly considered as an option, the sample size is not known. Further, any concept of informed consent for this is clearly an impossibility as the natives were faced with beings with powers and abilities far beyond their comprehension, all of whom likely took samples of blood and other bodily fluids. This means that the Cylon and Battlestar humans' "master plans" of ending the war by stripping the Battlestar humanity of all technology and leaving them marooned on the back-water world later known as "Earth" not only introduced untold numbers of genetic defects when the inevitable cross-breeding occurred, but likely created all sorts of blood-letting cults and religions due to the mistaken belief that the "supernatural" entities that came visiting 140,000 years ago came solely for the purpose of harvesting their blood, organs, etc, and offering these body-parts up as a sacrifice would bring the "gods" back.

<ul><li> The defense would like to point out that the elves later fought a several-millennia-long string of world wars with each other that totally destroyed most of the elven empires that created the mythal in the first place. Kind of hard to fix something when <em>you</em> no longer exist. Furthermore, recovered records indicate that the ease by which it was lost was partly the result of a deliberate policy of limiting information on the Mythal to those specific ancient elves that created the Mythal, with the benevolent intent of <em>keeping</em> any competent enough wizard from changing the control condition.
</li><li> As it pleases the Court, it is the ancient elves that are on trial, not their modern-day descendants. That the ancient elves managed to destroy their own civilization without securing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> is exactly why they're being prosecuted.

While things were all right for a while, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium</a> was discovered and the Element Lords led their subjects in waging a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBloodForPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBloodForPhlebotinum">No Blood for Phlebotinum</a> war over it, one that only ended when said Unobtainium split the planet into pieces. The Great Beings tried nonviolent solutions, all of which failed. The eventually resorted to creating baterra robots, a last-ditch doomsday weapon programmed to end the war by killing all armed combatants. However, they were released too late to prevent the disaster, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrideCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrideCommand">overrode their shutdown commands</a>.
<ul><li> While the sheer number of safeguards ensuring Mata Nui's functioning, as well as the attempts to stop the war and the disaster, argue against negligence, the issue of the Element Lords still looms large. However, it occurs to the court that the Great Beings are only precursors to Mata Nui and his inhabitants, not to the other races that they passed off to the Element Lords. So they were precursors and may have been negligent, but not both at the same time.
</li></ul></li><li> Charges have been found and filed against the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> being known as Primus: the defendant failed to properly expunge a deadly form of reproduction from the early Transformer ancestors, leading to the creation of the Swarm, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that nearly destroyed several civilizations across the galaxy, <em>including</em> the modern-day Transformers. The defendant also created the Fallen, a creature that oversaw the universal element of entropy, an element that the defendant's brother and eternal enemy Unicron <em>is the embodiment of</em>, essentially handing the Chaos Bringer his very own avatar to do his bidding with. In short, thanks to the defendant's absentmindedness, he had an indirect hand in creating two of the Transformers' worst enemies, of whom only one had been "neutralized" (although the Swarm's "purified" form of the Vok could arguably be considered just as nasty as their previous selves), while the other is still at large and continues to plague the defendant's creations, on occasion. The defendant also is highly reluctant to wake himself unless there is a significant and direct threat either from Unicron himself, or against the defendant's person, and even then, he uses proxies to do the dirty work, for him; for instance, he allowed the Transformers to wage a civil war that lasted aeons and devastated and drained their home planet - <em>the defendant's body</em> - almost to destruction, with very little repercussions, but when Unicron began actively hunting down and consuming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">sparks</a> of the Transformers, thus weakening the defendant's power, the defendant hired one of the remaining Transformers to form an army against Unicron, and allowed him to choose a scant <em>2</em> soldiers from time and space to fill that army with.

Naturally, the enslaving Ur-Quan Kzer-Za stumble across it, naming it Sa-Matra. Among the numerous other artifacts the Precursors left behind are: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">bombs used as planeteering tools</a> (one is used to put a hole in the outer layers of a star, causing it to flare like a supernova and sterilizing the entire inhabited system, and another is deemed powerful enough to destroy the Sa-Matra <em>only after amplifying modifications are added by the Chmrr</em>), the Mycon (biological planeteering tools that evolved into a race of fungi who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">terraform inhabited water worlds by force</a> to their own scorching ideal conditions), and Inter-Dimensional-Fatigue-wave-generating devices (the study of which gets the Androsynth eaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Lovecraftian extradimensional horrors</a>).
<ul><li> Arguably an act of self-defense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has stated that the sequel was always intended to explain what happened to the Precursors. Despite the fact that the original creators lost control over the IP before making said sequel; to some extent, the (non-canon) sequel Star Control 3 DID justify things. The Precursors had been searching for a way to survive a galaxy-wide genocidal sweep of sentient species from even more powerful space entities and FAILED to come up with a combative method of survival despite said superweapons.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eloh, the ancient precursors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa">Tabula Rasa</a></em>, created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">superscience capable of manipulating energy and matter by acts of will</a>.

When this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">didn't end well</a> - surprise, surprise - they annihilated the entire military of the first race to rise against them, the Thrax, firmly cementing xenophobia. Then a small faction called the Neph went and enslaved the Thrax and went on a war against the rest of the universe to make sure no one would ever be their equals again, starting with the mainstream Eloh. Rather than actually fighting back or enlisting (or even warning) the sentient races across the universe, the Eloh just tossed various pieces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> on random populated and unpopulated worlds.

</li><li> Potentially the player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em>. One of the achievements requires them to uplift a certain number of creatures. The easiest way to do this is to just randomly drop monoliths on every planet encountered without sentient life and then forget about it.
</li><li> Your Honor, I would like to submit another case: The Elder Gods from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> series. They seem to be perfectly willing to allow the realms to be endangered by either a renegade Elder (Shinnok), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> protector (Raiden) or other entity (Blaze).

</li><li> The Shee in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures">Creatures</a></em> series created the Norns, fuzzy adorable little critters with rudimentary intelligence that they claimed to love as pets. But when they decided it was time to move on to a bigger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldShapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldShapes">round</a> world, they left most of the creatures they had created to die on their home planet.
</li><li> Your Honor, I would like to bring forth the case of the people of Vana'diel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> versus Altana and the Celestial Avatars. Upon creating the world of Vana'diel Altana carelessly left the keys to undoing all of creation, the Mother Crystals, not in scattered places across the planet buried deep under the seas or mountains, but instead she left them easily accessible within hundreds of yalms of each other. And when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">the Zilart</a> attempted to harness the power of the Mother Crystals nearly obliterating the planet, did she attempt to move the Mother Crystals or even destroy the machinery that the Zilart created? No! She left it all intact setting the stage for the same tragedy to unfold again! Instead she sat back and watched while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">random people</a> got together and fought back the various schemes that she could not be bothered to acknowledge.
</li><li> The citizens of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> galaxy would like to present the following class-action suit against the ancient Hiigaran, Taiidani and Bentusi empires. The actions of the ancient Hiigarans, Taiidani and Bentusi resulted in the Hiigarans' descendants being exiled for 4,000 years on the barren desert world of Kharak, admittedly to prevent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ancient Hiigarans from enslaving the galaxy</span>. The terms prohibited the exiles from developing certain technologies. However, the records of those terms were lost, so that the Kushans had no idea of the danger. As a result, the modern Taiidani attacked in response, unaware that the Kushans had no way of knowing what was going on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wiping out all life on Kharak</span>.
<ul><li> Movement to remove the Bentusi from the claim. Yes they were involved in the original exile, but they were actively helpful to the modern Hiigarans and bore no grudge against them, even explaining the situation so the Hiigarans could understand why their homeworld was destroyed, which was done without the consent or help of the Bentusi.
</li></ul></li><li> The people of the collective worlds of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> wish to file charges against the Lufenian people. The plaintiff also wishes to directly charge Cid Lufaine and Shinryu in this incident. As evidence we point to the Lufenian War, which was directly responsible for the creation of airship technology, the floating fortress (which was filled with weaponry), the relocation of the crystal of Wind to said fortress, the invention of the War Machine technology, initial contact with the being known as Omega, the invention of Manikins, and the creation of the beings known as Cosmos and Chaos. Cid Lufaine and Shinryu, while not the perpetrators of the original Lufenian conflict are indicted for the following: 1.) Usage of Cosmos and Chaos to involve the innocents of other worlds, 2.) The eventual freeing of Chaos from World B, and the Time Loop he created thereafter, 3.) Imprisoning innocents in their sick war games, in a location known as "World B." 4.) The inhuman treatment of said innocents as cattle to feed Chaos and Shinryu, and 5.) All incidents caused, directly or indirectly, by the actions of Cid Lufaine, Chaos, and Shinryu, who, implicitly, endorsed the atrocities committed by Mateus Palamecia, the Cloud of Darkness, Theodor "Golbez" Harvey, Ex-Death, Kefka Palazzo, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jecht, up to and including their willingness to repeatedly restore life to these individuals at the cost of life of the innocent.
<ul><li> Though it should be noted, most of the actions committed by Cid of the Lufaine were in the service of country Onrac. Onrac was in a war with another country using devastating weapons of mass destruction. The Onracian military hired Cid as a means of creating weapons to counter this enemy, while the Lufenians with all of their superior technology appeared to not have been directly involved in said war. Therefore the entirety of the Lufenian people cannot be held directly responsible for the actions of one man, specifically Cid of the Lufaine.
</li></ul></li><li> In light of the testimony of Cmdr. Shepard of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, the Citadel races would like to file charges against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Catalyst, and its creators to be tried in absentia</span>. These individuals are responsible for the creation of the Reapers, currently facing at least 740 counts of galactic genocide. Only their claimed rationale for allowing these acts, that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they believed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a> to be inevitable, and thus created the Reapers to prevent sufficiently advanced races from creating sufficently powerful synthetic races</span>, prevents the plaintiffs from charging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">abuse</a> rather than neglect.

</li><li> Your Honor, the plaintiff seeks an injunction against Jas, the alleged Elder God of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>. Jas left behind a stone that was supposedly used by the current gods to create the current Runescape from an empty plane. This is up for debate, but it is clear that the Stone of Jas was the real reason behind the devastating God Wars, which resulted in the extinction of several races, turned a populated area into the cursed region known as the Wilderness, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">resulted in a single tribe of goblins hiding in a cave for centuries</a>.
<ul><li> Furthermore, Jas cursed a group of creatures called the Dragonkin to guard the stone. And by guard, the plaintiff refers to their habit of causing mass destruction to the nearest human settlement whenever <em>anybody</em> uses the Stone. To break free of this curse, the Dragonkin have created corrupted versions of themselves called dragons to act as bodyguards. These dragons have caused massive loss of property and life.
</li><li> Your Honor, the prosecution would like to present several exhibits. The Stone of Jas is one of 12 artifacts. The gods (not the Elder Gods, but the ones worshipped now) drew their power from these artifacts, and are responsible for cataclysmic conflicts.

While they did at least try to seal away their most dangerous creations, the execution leaves much to be desired. First, they allowed rumors of their Vaults to spread, ensuring a constant stream of treasure hunters seeking out their lost artifacts. Second, the Vaults are a far cry from secure; most Vaults are either guarded by a formidable but not insurmountable monster or locked with a poorly-hidden key that causes the growth of a dangerous mineral if used. Frankly, the entire effort was just sloppy.

While likely not outright precursors like the Quintessons, there is considerable evidence to be presented: At least two of their machines were present on or in the orbit of prehistoric Earth prior to the Beast Wars. While appearing more curious than malevolent in the beginning, by the halfway point of the show, they were clearly shown as openly hostile, and omnicidal. Consider the following:
<ul><li> Their second expedition to prehistoric Earth was an experiment to test and gauge the threat level of the Transformers. When the robots failed, the Vok's third machine was revealed - one of Earth's moons turned out to be a heat ray capable of a Class X <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a> event. This machine was used, and, if not for the intervention and sacrifice of Optimus Primal, would have achieved its purpose. Additionally, this device was indeed in orbit long before the arrival of the Transformers.
</li><li> Also, their fourth machine, while not quite as destructive, still posed an enormous threat, once it was captured by Megatron. The security protocols were almost laughably inept at keeping the robots out, much less preventing a hostile takeover.
</li><li> Finally, there is the arrival of the Vok themselves: intent on destroying the reality-breaking criminal Megatron, at a time when doing so would have created an equally damaging rift in time (i.e., the original Megatron's Spark was still inside his body). Furthermore, their lack of willingness to cooperate with, if not downright contempt for, Optimus Primal's warning about these consequences resulted in him nearly being killed.
