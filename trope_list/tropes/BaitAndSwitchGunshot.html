Our hero is rooted to the spot, either trying to talk to the gunman or frozen with fear. The gunman points without shooting for a while, then BANG! there is a loud gunshot. The hero jerks in fearful anticipation and a few seconds pass before they realise - they aren't hurt at all.
</p><p>One of five things happens then:
</p><p></p><ol><li> The gunman topples over dead, having just been shot by a good guy we didn't realize was there. Bonus points if the gunman falling out of frame dramatically reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyTimedAttackFromBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyTimedAttackFromBehind">the shooter behind him</a>.

Can be used as a subversion where the gunman just misses.
</li><li> No one falls. It's quickly revealed that, with or without the shooter's knowledge, the gun was loaded with blanks.
</li><li> No one falls. It's quickly revealed that the BANG! was not directly connected to the gunman at all — perhaps other people in the vicinity are shooting at each other, or perhaps it was just a loud noise resembling a gunshot.
</li><li> The gun turns out to be empty.

</p><p>In a <em>Metro</em> article on 14 August 2007 providing a list of action movie cliches, this was called "Third Person Shooter". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>'s book of film cliches, meanwhile, calls it "In the Nick of Heroism".

Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHolesAndRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHolesAndRevelations">Bullet Holes and Revelations</a>. Sometimes related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootYourMate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootYourMate">Shoot Your Mate</a>. Can lead to a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery">Super Dickery</a> if used in a commercial or as the ender to a multi-part episode. For white weapons, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StabTheScorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StabTheScorpion">Stab the Scorpion</a> (which are specifically similar to type 2 of this trope). Compare the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy">Blofeld Ploy</a>, where the villain sets up the expectation that he will kill one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mook</a>, but then kills a different one entirely.

<ul><li> Twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> "Intoccabile Acte II". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first time a mook is firing into three small waterfalls where Kirika may be hiding; as he turns to face the third waterfall a shot rings out, which turns out to be Kirika firing first. And when the Intoccabile appears to have stabbed Mirielle, it turns out that Kirika has shot her blade in half</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first season finale ends on this trope and, infuriatingly, <em>doesn't show the answer</em> until the second episode of R2. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Lelouch and Suzaku fired near-misses, at which point Suzaku charged in and knocked the gun out of Lelouch's hand, ending the standoff.</span>
</li><li> Done again at the tail end of R2, wherein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diethard aims a gun at Lelouch, a shot is fired, and then Diethard falls over, having been shot in the shoulder by the now-Geassed Schneizel</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the penultimate episode, when Johan cannot sufficiently motivate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Dr. Tenma</a> to shoot him and finish what he started (and therefore manage to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">achieve the perfect suicide while proving Tenma's worldview that "all lives are equal" to be wrong</span>), he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">points a gun at Wim Knaup, a boy that had followed Tenma to the grounds of the confrontation</a>. Tenma, driven to extreme desperation, prepares to go through with the act to save Wim's life, and soon after, a gunshot rings out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Johan collapses with another bloody exit wound in his head</span>. The audience is initially led to believe that Tenma pulled the trigger by the reactions of Nina, Rudi Gillen and Tenma himself, but it turns out that it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wim's drunk father, who happened upon the scene and saw "the devil" threatening his child</span>.
</li><li> Another example occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvasiveFightThreadEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvasiveFightThreadEpisode">the episode</a> preceding that one, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roberto</span> seemingly has Inspector Lunge at his mercy after shooting him in the shoulder, and prepares to deliver the <em>coup de grâce</em>. A gunshot is heard as the footage cuts to the outside of the hotel they are in ... only for it to later be revealed that Lunge had a second concealed pistol that he used to shoot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roberto</span>, who is now lying on the bed momentarily stunned.
</li></ul></li><li> In the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ZAFT Chairman Gilbert Durandal</span> is confronted by not one but two gunmen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kira Yamato and his former lover Talia Gladys</span>. A shot rings out, and it turns out neither of them shot him. His killer is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rey Za Burrel, a clone who he'd been a father figure to. <strong>Everybody</strong> betrayed Gilbert, but due to the way the series was handled, it usually comes with little or no explanation.</span>
</li><li> A version of this is done with a sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the period when Conrad is pretending to be a traitor, Yuri is captured, tied up, and presented to Conrad to kill. Conrad takes the sword, walks up to Yuri, and then there's a swish as the sword is swung... only to show that Yuri's bindings have been slashed through and Conrad is taking down the guards around them.</span>
</li><li> A rather complicated one at the end of the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em>, combined with subversions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivingSave">Diving Save</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>. Jean points a gun at Chiaki, and Hei jumps in front of her as we hear a gunshot; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">however, <em>she</em> was the one who shot him, as she was actually a Doll implanted with the original's personality and Jean had just wiped it.</span> Subverted in that, unfortunately for the bad guys who then proceed to empty a good five shots into his back while he's lying on the ground apparently incapacitated, Hei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a> is bulletproof no matter <em>who's</em> shooting at him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop">Angel Cop</a></em>, Angel's first act on camera is to save Raiden in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot">Bait-and-Switch Gunshot</a> scene.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em> during one of the Queen Berry episodes.
</li><li> This happens, but is subverted, twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>.
<ul><li> In <em>Jungle Cruise</em>, Batou is set on capturing a war-turned murderous psychopath named Marco Amoretti who still thinks that he's fighting his own personal war. Marco has committed murders around the city that cuts too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseToHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseToHome">Close to Home</a> to Batou, and he knows it's up to him to finally end it all. Batou chases after him, eventually cornering him up against a wall with his pistol aimed at Marco's head. Marco finds pleasure in the situation. He excitedly begs Batou to shoot him, put a bullet in his brain and end it all. Batou is seething with rage at this point, more than willing to give in to his plea. Togusa rounds the corner and shouts out for him to stop just in time to hear gunfire. We see Marco's body spasm and contort against the wall as Batou empties his gun. Marco is then surprised but at the same time disappointed that he's still alive. Batou emptied his gun into the wall on either side of his head, and finally arrests him.
</li><li> An homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver">Taxi Driver</a></em>, <em>Night Cruise</em> in the 2nd season focuses on a war veteran turned refugee named Gino, who found a way to cope with his PTSD by imagining scenarios in his head where he suddenly becomes the hero by killing his scumbag boss, saving the life of a hooker, and at one point dreaming of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> just to have the hooker fall for him. Section 9 was monitoring him to tell whether he'd actually carry out these dreams or not. In the real world though, he buys the services of a prostitute, only to find that he doesn't have enough money for very much more than having her undress. When he tries to bargain with her, she calmly calls for her boss to deal with the situation. The pimp drags him out into the back alley and points a gun at his head in one hand while holding all of Gino's cash in the other. Gino begs him not to shoot or take all his money. Gino winces as he hears the pimp yell "BANG!" before putting his gun away, tossing Gino his clothes, and leaving him in the trash where he lay.
</li></ul></li><li> Brilliantly done in episode 61 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, where Yang thought he was dead for sure when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Alliance soldier ordered to execute him</span> pointed his gun at him and a shot was fired. Turns out that the shot was fired by Frederica Greenhill, who managed to rescue Yang in the nick of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> Season II episode 9 ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack">Smash to Black</a> and a gunshot. Episode 10 reveals what happened.
</li><li> Underplayed at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a> 2</em>: Shinobu confronts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> with a shotgun. She points it at him and does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock">Dramatic Gun Cock</a>, but then just fires a flare shell in the air to signal the others.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Phantom Blood</a></em>. As Dio approaches after revealing his vampirism, Jonathan is urged to shoot him, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. A gunshot goes off, and it's revealed Speedwagon was the one to fire on Dio, with Jonathan beside him, still shaking.

McGarrett and Danny have their guns drawn on the wounded survivor of the robbery at the beginning of the episode, who's got a hostage at gunpoint. All of a sudden, he falls to the ground, not from a gunshot anywhere but because he had chosen that moment to die from his earlier wound.

But wait, the camera turns around to show the bullet floating in mid air before dropping to the ground. Turns out Sylar was able to stop the IV drip so that his powers were in his control again.
</li><li> Another moment which fits the spirit of the trope, if not the letter, happens when Sylar's mother tries to kill him with a pair of scissors; they struggle, too closely to tell clearly what's going on, then there is a sound effect, Sylar looks horrified, and they stumble apart to reveal said scissors sticking out of Mommy's chest.

It cuts away, everyone hears a gunshot sound, and we cut back to see the sniper himself was shot by the Mandalorian's partner for the episode, Cara Dune.

There's a lightning draw, the sound of just a single shot, and we see the Kid nonchalantly spin his revolver on his finger and holster it. Then drop to his knees and keel over, dead. Bonus points because they allegedly filmed the quickdraw for real (with blanks, obviously), and there really was just the one gunshot sound - because, it transpired when they developed the film and watched it back, McGoohan beat Kanner to the draw by just two frames.

When Heller arrives, Rook pulls a gun, then shoots his two lackeys <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and tells him to get his daughter and "get the hell out of [his] city",</span> his likely justification being that James is so indestructible that holding him on the island is more dangerous than giving him what he wants so he just goes away.
