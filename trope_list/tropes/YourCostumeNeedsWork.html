<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> - When they temporarily join a company of traveling actors, Lina and Gourry are given a bit part as the dragon, while Amelia is asked to play the hero. The name of the play? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Bring Us Justice and Peace: The Death of the Abominable Fiend</span> Lina Inverse."
</li><li> This happens to Gohan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> when he interrupts filming in a movie about the Great Saiyaman. The director and actors mistake him for a meddling stunt double. They only realize it's the real deal when, after being rejected, he flies away — dragging a huge crane behind him, no less.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> likewise had a mini-arc where they were making a "Great Saiyaman vs. Mr. Satan" movie, and Satan (who knows Gohan's identity) got him cast as the Saiyaman's stunt double so he could get at least some small recognition for his heroics; the rest of the cast and crew just assumed he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">doing his nerdy son-in-law a favor</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> manga, chapter 520, Inuyasha shows up on a present-day Tokyo train as he usually appears, haori, sword, ears and hair and all. Some of the innocent bystanders think he is cosplaying, but say that he's not a very good cosplayer. This makes sense since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox">not many manga exist inside their own worlds</a>. So, even if it was Sesshoumaru in his brother's place, he could as well be given the same treatment (after all, some people do cosplays of their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> characters, which gives some bystanders the right to point flaws in them).

Nobody was alarmed because it was a real good life-size replica for a 10 year old. It's okay, a dinosaur that snorts, talks, walks and spits fireballs is just a basic project to do for your average 10 year old. We're in Japan, after all.

Realizing it's awake, he takes it to a costume party, claiming it's a couple in a moose suit... which is precisely who wins the Best Costume award, for which the actual moose comes in second.

He is easily defeated and unmasked, with Ock beating him down with his bare hands... and his poor showing convinces Doc Ock, the hostage, and the other witnesses that he isn't Spider-Man but just Peter Parker making a brave but very foolish effort to save her.

<ul><li> In a classic '70s era story, "The Batman Nobody Knows", Bruce Wayne takes some inner-city kids on a camping trip, and around the campfire, the subject of Batman comes up. As Bruce listens, the kids describe what they think Batman's like (one calls him a demon, another claims that he's Shaft-meets-Superfly). Bruce then emerges from the woods in his Batman costume, and the kids reply, "Yeah, nice costume, Mr. Wayne, but you ain't no Batman!" It's not so much that his <em>costume</em> needs work: at the end, Bruce wonders why he didn't get the reaction he intended. He realizes that it's because the kids are <em>innocent</em>, and they have nothing to fear from Batman.
</li><li> Inverted in the third issue of <em>Batman, Inc</em>:
<div class="indent"> "Why the hell is Batman masquerading as <strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>, anyway? I've <strong>met</strong> Wayne and you don't fool <strong>me</strong>."

</li><li> And in a late '70s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, Tony Stark goes "undercover" as Iron Man at the San Diego Comic Con.

Nobody realizes that it's really her until she ends up having to save the group from several supervillains who had kidnapped them in order to blackmail the REAL superhero team. In this case, she really is wearing a poor replica of her real costume.
<ul><li> In a semi-related example, Major Havok once wrote fanfiction about himself and posted it anonymously, figuring that nobody could get his character down better than the real deal. Cue several reader comments on how bad and unrealistic the characterization was, including one (which, on a reread, you realize is from Empowered's alter ego) claiming it completely misses the homo-erotic subtext that supposedly makes Havok such a compelling character.

</li><li> In one other occasion, Ginko is searching for Diabolik and Eva, who have committed a heist in the Italian city of Lucca during the local <em>city-wide</em> convention... And has to deal with <em>thousands</em> of people dressed in Diabolik's trademark body suit, as Diabolik has distributed free suits before committing the heist. In the meantime, Diabolik and Eva calmly waltz through the checks because they were wearing <em>fattening versions of Diabolik's suit</em> (Ginko realizes he's been had only when a cop asks him if they were giving away Diabolik's car too).

She's convinced that Deadpool's the real deal after he saves Tippy Toe, but since it wouldn't be fair to the impersonators who put in actual effort in their costumes, she gives him a "Minimum Effort" participation badge as reward instead.

<ul><li> Also in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a> platoon-members in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> were denied permission to pass themselves off as women to infiltrate an enemy base by their clueless officer, who didn't think they could pull off this deception as well as himself. When they tried it anyway and got captured, the enemy officers likewise thought their costumes were laughably bad ... until one of the Pollys lifted her skirts.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Something Rotten</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand">Hamlet</a> gets into an argument with a group of Shakespeare fans who challenge him to a contest of who can perform the best "To be or not to be" speech. Hamlet loses.
</li><li> Maurice Baring (a friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaireBelloc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaireBelloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>) loved this trope; his anthology <em>Orpheus in Mayfair</em> features it at least twice. One isn't quite this trope but it's definitely in the ballpark, the eponymous story: a Greek musician is hired to play "authentic Greek music" at a party, his first big break in a while, but then his son gets sick. He's desperate, and then Orpheus appears, and offers to cover for him. Of course, Orpheus' music — which could turn nymphs into trees with its beauty, mind  is too authentically Greek for them, and they don't like it. In another, a woman sells her soul to the devil to have Shakespeare attend one of her parties. He shows up, but, Shakespeare having been almost boringly <em>normal</em>, he just makes small talk with the guests, and nobody even realizes who he is.
</li><li> Often happens to the heroine of the French <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantomette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantomette">Fantomette</a></em> series, to the point that she doesn't worry much if her friends are involved in one of her adventures since they just never suspect she's the real thing. On the other hand, one of her <em>friends</em> is sometimes mistaken for her.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySideOfTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySideOfTheMountain">My Side of the Mountain</a></em>, after he's been living in the woods for a while, Sam makes a foray into town, wearing one of his deerskin suits. He meets another boy, who assumes he's into the Davy Crockett/cowboys-and-Indians trend (the book was written in the late fifties) and tells him his outfit looks totally fake, sarcastically asking if he chewed the leather himself (Sam responds that he actually ended up softening most of it by hitting it against a rock, only chewing a little around the neck).
</li><li> In Brecht's short story "The Monster," a destitute old man has a striking resemblance to the lead actor in a film about a notorious anti-Semite (because he <em>is</em> said notorious anti-Semite), so they let him play himself in a scene or two. They find his acting wooden and not dramatically sadistic enough. He's just happy the script calls for him to eat an apple.

They pass, but the guard says that no one would believe in a Luke Skywalker that short, despite Luke's whining insistence that he can "do backflips just like him." Once they're out of earshot, Luke asks Mara what her real hair color was before. Mara is not amused.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows">The Outlaw Demon Wails</a></em>, Rachel inadvertently lines up for a costume contest and is told she was close, but "Rachel Morgan's hair isn't that frizzy." Despite that, she would probably have won had Trent not also been in line, looking like himself.
</li><li> In <em>Bel Air Bambi and the Mall Rats</em>, one of Richard Peck's more obscure YA novels, there is a part near the end where the school delinquent/bully shows up to a casting call, to audition for the role of...you guessed it...the lead female delinquent/bully for an in universe movie based on the books plot; basically, she was auditioning to play herself. She is passed over for being way too-over-the-top for the role!
</li><li> One of the <em>Star Wreck</em> novels by Leah Rewolinski involved the characters arriving at a <em>Star Wreck</em> convention. Commander <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyName">Dacron</a> was told his costume needed work.

And while she <em>did</em> use a piece of cloth to disguise herself, the man in the ticket booth fails to realize who she is even after she balks at having to pay "to get into [her] own home", and amusingly thinks she's pretending to be herself ("You do play the part, don't you?").
</li><li> In <em>First Drop of Crimson</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mencheres is forced to turn Kira into a vampire</span>, and the villain deliberately leaks video of this, which ends up on the news and YouTube. YouTube commenters, being a special brand of stupid and horrible, post such gems as "Worst actress ever," "Should have had more blood," and "WTF is up with the lame glowing eyes?"

"Napoleon" is taller than him, does not dress at all to resemble him and instead follows dandy fashions of the day, and doesn't have the correct accent, so Hornblower concludes that it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion">Napoleon Delusion</a>. Hornblower lends him a carriage (mostly because it amused him) but some weeks later he and his wife gets a letter from the new President of France, Napoleon Bonaparte <em>the Third</em> (nephew of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>), graciously thanking them for the service they rendered, making this more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> (and perhaps Napoleon exploiting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NapoleonDelusion">Napoleon Delusion</a> trope).

The kid then has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when he realizes it isn't a costume.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, Eidolon is the most famous and powerful Parahuman in the world. In the rare moments he takes off his mask, people are often disappointed by his real, unattractive appearance. He is likened to someone dressing up as Eidolon for an office Halloween party.

</li><li> There is a one-off British comedy charity special starring Sir Bob Geldof as himself. In short, he finds himself stranded at a pub where a celebrity impersonator karaoke competition is ongoing. Through a series of developments Geldof winds up singing the Boomtown Rats' breakout single "I Don't Like Mondays" live.

As they're leaving, Leonard apologizes for bothering him, which prompts him to admit that he <em>is</em> Nathan Fillion, he just wanted to enjoy a meal in peace, but since they've been respectful, he offers them a picture and an autograph. Raj, who was convinced until this point, suddenly decides that he can't be Nathan Fillion after all.

</li><li> In a Halloween episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkAngel">Dark Angel</a></em>, several of the cast (who were transgenic supersoldiers with barcodes on their necks) tried to pass for people dressed as... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself">transgenic supersoldiers with barcodes on their necks</a>. The response to the costumes varied, some were considered cool, others unoriginal, and some normal humans were using the same costume. The transgenics were actually what they were cosplaying as, and using it as a cover, but some were still told it needed work. Also played with where one transgenic, a lizard man bred to fight in the desert, doesn't quite get it, goes around with a football helmet on as his costume, saying he's Joe Namath.

He is then reduced to stammering when his victim proves she's the <em>real</em> Dionne Warwick.

Unbeknownst to her, the very producer she wants to fool overhears her plight and volunteers himself as an actor. Lucy is reluctant to hire him because he doesn't look the part at all, corrects his wardrobe, and coaches him on how to sound important and act like a producer and never feels she makes any progress.

</li><li> In one episode, Lucy convinces some neighbors to install a shower for her. Instead, they hire a professional plumber, introducing him as a handy friend. Lucy spends most of her conversation with the plumber commenting on professional plumbers, and how he looks nothing like a professional plumber, even when he says it point blank.

Meeting the imposter Mary in private, Catherine says she knows she's a fraud... as she and Mary are "mother and daughter" who pull the same con posing as Mary and Catherine. The imposter Mary laughs on how it's not bad although she knows she makes a much better Mary and that "the real Catherine looks so much older."

At the end, the crew is filming outside, when an actual massive starship descends through the clouds and hovers right above them. The camera guy is told to film it. At the end, two crew members discuss how fake the ship looked and mentioning that they'll fix it in post.

</li><li> The entire premise of the game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToTellTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToTellTheTruth">To Tell the Truth</a></em> was for a semi-famous or notable person to be paired with two impostors, and the contestants had to figure out which was the real one. They often got it wrong. It usually used people who might be known by name or reputation, but not by appearance, to the panelists doing the guessing (the founder of a company or organization, an inventor, or a very minor author, for example). The two impostors were also similar in age and appearance to the real person. The show was famously pranked by professional prankster Joey Skaggs, who sent an impostor in his place. Skaggs pulls the impostor-as-him trick so often that the impostor knows pretty much everything about him, and what he makes up at least sounds plausible...
</li><li> A famous example occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> episode "Gypsies, Tramps, and Weed."

Will, Grace, and Karen get fed up with his obsession and storm away, prompting Jack to soothe the doll. A voice then remarks that it's weird that Jack is talking to a toy. Said voice belongs to the <em>real</em> Cher, who just so happened to be nearby. Jack, of course, naturally assumes that she is "just some drag queen" (although he gives "him" credit for pulling off the look), and launches into his own Cher impression to give her tips. Cher tries singing "If I Could Turn Back Time" to prove her identity, but Jack takes this as another invitation to show off. It isn't until Cher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonstruck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonstruck">slaps him across the face and says "Snap out of it"</a> that he realizes that it's actually Cher...and he promptly faints dead away.

</li><li> Not exactly a lookalike contest, but there is a story about late great Kurt Vonnegut (who is, ahem, well known for having his way with words) helping his grandson to write an essay.

Even though Conway looked <em>nothing</em> like Kubrick and knew nothing about any of his movies, he completely fooled interviewers and critics.
</li><li> Kubrick himself inverted this trope. Being somewhat of a recluse, very few people in the press knew what he looked like, so when they knocked on his door asking for an interview, he simply answered the door himself and said "Stanley Kubrick's not home". Very rarely was he second-guessed.

</li><li> Virtuoso concert violinist Joshua Bell in 2007 <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9521098">busked in a DC Metro station<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and made a grand total of $59. Possibly justified since a metro station is generally noisy, the acoustics are lousy for a violin and it was during rush hour, so many people probably couldn't stop. The low income generated may be less about mistaking him for a lesser performer, and more about completely not noticing him. This was done as part of a study, and several people who had passed through the station were asked if they had seen anything unusual in the station. All but one didn't even remember there being any violinist. The one who did remember though, (a postal worker by trade) could not shut up about him.

<div class="indent"><strong>Bobcat:</strong> This lady walked up to me and said "Don't take this the wrong way, but you look like Bobcat Goldthwait." <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>]</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">How am I supposed to take that?</a>

The driver said, "You have the same name as that science guy." And it turns out the driver had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">reverse problem</a>. His name was William Buckley.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a>, voice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Homer Simpson</a>, once told of how he was told by a <em>Simpsons</em> fan that they would love to meet the voice of Homer. When he told her that he did the voice of Homer, the woman laughed him off.
</li><li> British comedy personality Harry Hill stated in an interview that he was asked by a man on the street who he was because the man recognized him from somewhere. The man started naming celebrities who he thinks he could be leading Hill to say: "How about Harry Hill?" The man said no, stating that he looked nothing like him.
</li><li> Alluding to a rising Broadway star whose name was on everyone's lips, a Hollywood director at a party (so the story goes) pointed to someone dancing and said "Forget <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneTierney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneTierney">Gene Tierney</a>! Get me <em>that</em> girl!" It goes without saying who "that girl" was.
</li><li> A story about the nineteenth-century chess champion Emmanuel Lasker holds that he once visited a chess club and played some games unrecognized by anyone there, including a man who called himself "the Lasker of this club".
<ul><li> Sometimes it's told about Max Euwe playing with a guy during a train ride.
</li></ul></li><li> Peyton Manning has stated that the best way to avoid being recognized is to wear a Peyton Manning jersey.
</li><li> Inverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel">Jewel</a>, who went so far as to wear a fake nose and a wig to sing her own songs at a karaoke bar. Nobody recognized her at all (until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>), and she got rave reviews on how well she did Jewel songs. She even sang the same song later the same night out of costume, under the auspices of making a "surprise appearance" as herself - before the full reveal, an audience member who hadn't caught on said she thought this other woman had done a better job than the "real" Jewel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele">Adele</a> once donned a fake nose and chin to prank an Adele impersonator contest. Unlike Jewel, however, once she started singing, everyone instantly realized who she was: her voice is simply that distinctive.
</li><li> Japanese filmmaker and comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiKitano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiKitano">Beat Takeshi</a> told a story on an episode of <em>Takeshi Art Beat</em> about being accosted by a drunk in a bar out in the boonies for "trying to be Beat Takeshi".
</li><li> Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill was at a White House party and someone told her she had "almost a Dorothy Hamill haircut."
</li><li> When Disney decided that it would be a good idea to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries">family sitcom based on</a> the <em>very</em> R-rated indie comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em>, the film's two leads, Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson, decided to audition for their respective parts from the film. However, Anderson's character of Randall had already been cast with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> star Jim Breuer, so instead the two auditioned for O'Halloran's Dante. Neither got the part, and a no-name actor who looked nothing like O'Halloran was instead cast as Dante for the failed pilot. O'Halloran and Anderson have both gone on record saying they don't regret losing the part.
</li><li> Actress Joan Allen once told a story on <em>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</em> of a woman approaching her in a gym locker room who remarked that she resembled a young Joan Allen. Which she took as a compliment.

</li><li> Some critics and audiences criticized the "actor" who played Senator Joseph McCarthy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodNightAndGoodLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodNightAndGoodLuck">Good Night, and Good Luck.</a></em> for being too over-the-top. All of the McCarthy moments were actually archive footage of the real Senator McCarthy.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a> hired Anthony Quinn to play the Arab leader Auda abu Tayi. Quinn did his own makeup and showed up on set in costume. As they were filming on location in Africa, Lean assumed Quinn was a local Arab and told his assistant to get on the phone and fire Quinn, as he wanted to hire the "Arab."
</li><li> During San Diego Comic Con in 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman">Hugh Jackman</a> wandered around San Diego in the full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> garb.

</div></li><li> Also at Comic Con 2013, Bryan Cranston went around dressed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Walter White</a>... complete with plastic Walter White mask. While certainly amusing, it does make it hard to tell how to categorize this example.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion">Nathan Fillion</a> has been told that his imitation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Malcolm Reynolds</a> "needed work".

Even when he dropped hints (or flat-out stated) that he was the actor behind the character, several fans still thought he was merely a very convincing cosplayer.
</li><li> While in a bookshop, journalist and political commentator <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndrewMarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndrewMarr">Andrew Marr</a> was approached by someone who told him "You look just like that Andrew Marr bloke. You poor bastard."
</li><li> There is also an amusing story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> walking into a shop dressed fairly ordinarily. The shopkeeper remarked something along the lines of "Excuse me, but you do look awfully like the Queen." The Queen replied: "How very reassuring."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KitHarington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KitHarington">Kit Harington</a> was once approached in a bar by a woman who said that he looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Jon Snow</a>. However, when he explained that he plays him, the woman wouldn't believe him, saying Jon is taller.

</li><li> The owner of a haunted house near Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, refused to purchase a mannequin that he felt was not lifelike enough.

</li><li> Larry Kenny, the voice of Lion-O from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">ThunderCats</a></em>, once met two boys at a Toys 'R' Us who were arguing about which ThunderCats action figure to get. He introduced himself, and in his Lion-O voice, told them to get a Lion-O action figure. As he walked away, the boys said he didn't sound anything like Lion-O.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> premiered, some viewers criticized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieBamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieBamber">Jamie Bamber</a>'s British accent, having assumed Bamber was an American after watching him for the past four years on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>. Bamber is in fact British (though he has US citizenship thanks to his father being American) and needless to say, the British accent is the real one.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the actor Peter Butterworth was captured by the Nazis and put in Stalag Luft III, where he became part of the Wooden Horse escape; one of the vaulters over the vaulting horse concealing the tunnel. When he auditioned for the 1950 film <em>The Wooden Horse</em>, he was told he didn't look heroic or athletic enough for the part.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a> once went to a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2014/03/17/kylie-minogue-sexy-time">drag queen event<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> themed around her and said the queens just outshined her when she got pulled onstage by the queens.

</li><li> An auditory instead of a visual example, but voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomokazuSugita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomokazuSugita">Tomokazu Sugita</a> once did an impression of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> for some relatives' children. The kids <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kitakubu.co/2015/03/kids-tell-sugita-tomokazu-he-doesnt-sound-like-gintamas-gintoki/">complained that he didn't sound like Gintoki at all.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Sugita tweeted about it to fellow voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SumireUesaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SumireUesaka">Sumire Uesaka</a>, who more or less referenced this trope.
</li><li> As part of his act, the Russian comedian Maxim Galkin occasionally includes a (possibly apocryphal) story about his friends and fellow celebrities <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FilippKirkorov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FilippKirkorov">Filipp Kirkorov</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllaPugacheva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllaPugacheva">Alla Pugacheva</a>. According to him, the three of them were in an elevator, when a couple of obviously provincial visitors entered. The ride down was totally silent with the couple staring at the three celebrities. Just before exiting, the guy smiled and pointed at Galkin, telling him that he looks like the original the most, leaving Kirkorov and Pugacheva in shock.
</li><li> On her website, Patti LuPone mentions a time when she auditioned for a part where the prototype was her, Patti LuPone, and in the audition room ended up being told she was wrong for the prototype.

Not only do people not believe it's really them, but sometimes their profiles get flagged for using a "fake" picture of a celebrity...despite being a real picture of themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrahamNortonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrahamNortonShow">The Graham Norton Show</a></em> that a guy in a car parts place looked at him and told him that he looked like Mr. Bean. When Rowan told him he's actually the actor who played Mr. Bean, the guy laughed and didn't believed it because "the resemblance is uncanny".
</li><li> A variation: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretAtwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretAtwood">Margaret Atwood</a> commented on an indictment of a shooting victim for manslaugher of her unborn child with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHandmaidsTale">The Handmaid's Tale</a> comes to life in Alabama. Women must heed the warning". A fellow Twitter user replied with "I think you and I were watching different shows".
</li><li> Real-life inversion: Voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker">Frank Welker</a>, noted for his exceptional animal-vocalization work as well as his ubiquitous speaking roles in cartoons, was once nearly credited for the work he'd done on an animated piece he'd never recorded anything for. At the last minute, the folks compiling its closing credits recalled that, no, they'd used an actual horse this time.
</li><li> In January 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone">Sharon Stone</a> took to Twitter to complain that she had been kicked off Bumble. There had been multiple flags on her account because nobody would believe Sharon Stone was on a dating app.

Upon hearing her slip into her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Bart Simpson</a> voice (easily her most recognizable role), he praises her impression as "really good." Cartwright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">giggles at the mistake</a> and asks the boy if he knows who the voice actor is...and a few seconds (and another use of the voice) later, the kid's eyes go wide as he realizes he's actually talking to Bart.

As the session was text-only, there wasn't any way of telling who was who. The chat was then tasked with voting for which presenter they thought was the real Bowie; when the results came in, Bowie ended up in dead-last, being outvoted in favor of <em>both</em> of the impersonators.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaMiyake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaMiyake">Kenta Miyake</a> has a son who is very much a fan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyHeroAcademia">All Might</a>, but is too young to realize that Miyake plays All Might. When he tested this out by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"I Am Here"</a> in-character, his son said it didn't sound right.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZachGalifianakis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZachGalifianakis">Zach Galifianakis</a> once told a story of being approached by someone who said, "You look just like that guy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover">The Hangover</a> ... <em>no offense</em>."

</li><li> Inverted: Bob West, the original voice actor for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney the Dinosaur</a>, would occasionally have parents tell him that their children heard Barney in his voice, without knowing that he was the voice of Barney.
