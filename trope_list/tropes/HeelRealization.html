<ul><li> This happened to Noah too. The Heel Realization for him came after Mokuba, despite everything that Noah had done, seemed willing to help Noah, even going so far as to call him his brother (even though that was only a technicality in the <em>loosest</em> terms, if that) and Noah double-crossed him anyway, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">stealing Mokuba's body</a> in order to flee the Virtual World before Gozaburo put his plan into motion.

His road to a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> started when Yusei defeated him the first time, and it took longer than most.

But Kalin (Kiryu) was the biggest example: he became a Dark Signer intentionally because he believed that his best friend had sold him out to the police for going too far in their vigilante activities. Like the other Dark Signers, he died upon defeat and was reborn as human. But unlike Carly and the others, he kept his memories of being a Dark Signer, and with the truth of the matter known to him (his best friend had tried and failed to sacrifice himself for him), he went into a self-imposed exile to punish himself.

Heinrich had heard the rumors before then, but he hadn't believed in them. The third book sums it up nicely:
<div class="indent">What Skorzeny didn't get and wouldn't get if he lived to be a hundred - not likely, considering how the SS man lived - was that <em>what we were supposed to do</em> and <em>what our superiors ordered us to do</em> weren't necessarily the same thing. <br/>Soldiers didn't commonly had to make that distinction. Jäger hadn't worried about it, not until he had found out how the Germans dealt with Jews in the east. Since then, he hadn't been able to look away. He knew what sort of disaster awaited the world if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Lizards</a> won the war. Like Skorzeny, he was willing to do anything to keep that from happening.

<ul><li> This is especially poignant, as earlier in the series the character somewhat identified with blacks (though in a way that only made him dislike them more). He himself was of Mexican descent and commented more than once that in the eyes of most Confederates, he was at most only one step away from blacks.
