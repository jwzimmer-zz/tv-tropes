Considering that the game was designed with ranged weapons in mind, that presents a challenge.

The former's version is still much easier than the latter's and actually changes things other than the amount of damage the enemies can take and dish out, such as giving bosses additional attacks and changing a jumping puzzle, while the latter focuses more on enemies that take absurd amounts of abuse to kill and who kill you in 1 or 2 hits unless you spend the first 10 hours of gameplay grinding levels on skeletons. And to add more insult to injury, you can't even use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> you get for beating the mode in a normal game in <em>COD</em> like you can in <em>LOI</em>, making it practically useless.

As Albus, it's a breeze until you reach the Skeleton Cave, in which you'll probably have a much harder time than Shanoa due to lack of items and the Zombie familiar, which can block fireballs for you. Let's not even get started on what would happen if you ever decided to play with the Old Axe Armor while stuck at level one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait Of Ruin</a></em>...

As an extra difficulty, it also has "Masterful" which is Nintendo Hard to the extreme. "Insanity" manages to top that by making your character a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes">3D Dot Game Heroes</a></em> has standard mode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FromSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FromSoftware">From</a> Mode, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker">Spelunker</a> Mode.

<ul><li> And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em>: where Hard Mode means no Cyber Elves, <em>no charge shot</em>, and you take double damage from everything.

The description literally states 'virtually impossible on your own', which in this case means 'if you're playing solo, expect to have to take on about 10-15 difficult enemies in one tiny room and get crushed' Seriously, 20 odd floors of Hunter or Surprise mode on Expert is damn near suicidal, and 25 floors of Rush mode is basically a death wish. Endless also ends up coming under this, since it seems to start off on hard mode difficulty and end up being as tough or even more so than expert by about the 10th floor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RabiRibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RabiRibi">Rabi-Ribi</a></em> has two difficulties above Hard Mode, though they only buff the HP and damage of enemies without giving them new attacks - Hell and Bunny Extinction. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">There's achievements for completing the game's main story, post-game story, and boss rush modes for each of these modes.</a> As well, on normal mode or below, you can get a special buff that gives a general stat increase if you die enough times. Not so for Hard, Hell, and Bunny Extinction modes. Still too easy? The Artbook DLC offers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Unknown and Impossible difficulties</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BroForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BroForce">Bro Force</a></em> has Ironbro mode. (Player starts with a random bro and needs to re-unlock more. While they are unlocked faster than usual, each bro that dies is gone in that playthrough.) While this is not too difficult if the player is careful and has luck in unlocks, the game outright states that using Hard difficulty on this mode is simply unfair.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> HD</em> has a Hero Mode that makes you take double damage, and the game also supports the Ganondorf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a>, which also causes you to take double damage. But individually, both of these don't qualify for this. Rather, these two modes can <em>stack</em>, allowing you to use the Ganondorf amiibo while in Hero Mode, giving you <em>quadruple</em> damage. You can possibly breeze through the first half of the game, and regular enemies tend to be slow attackers that you have to wait for them to hit you, but later bosses and minibosses like Darknuts can be a real pain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Momodora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Momodora">Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</a></em>'s "Insane" difficulty, which the game describes only as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotAttempt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotAttempt">"Don't even try this."</a> In addition to the increased number of enemies on Hard mode, "Insane" also makes you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. Obviously this makes the game rather unforgiving, but it has a helpful side-effect—on any difficulty, bosses drop special items if you kill them without taking damage, and with only 1 hit point, you're guaranteed the bonus drop... if you survive.

"Heaven Or Hell" from the third game, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">both the main character and all enemies</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">die in one hit</a>, is somewhere between a gimmick mode and Harder Than Hard. "Hell and Hell," in the fourth game and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">the Ninja Theory reboot</a>, has <em>only</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">the main character dying in one hit</a> and is very much Harder Than Hard. Of course, if you perfected your style play on Sons on Sparda with no health lost, you, sir, are set...mostly.
<ul><li> In the initial US release of DMC3, Easy was equivalent to Japanese!Normal, Normal was equivalent to Japanese!Hard, and US!Hard is possibly the first time that Hard is Harder than Hard. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> made the difficulties more in line with the Japanese difficulties, wherein US!Hard was rechristened "Very Hard".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Definitive Edition</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">DmC: Devil May Cry</a></em> included a new "Gods Must Die" difficulty, which ratchets the difficulty up to ridiculous levels, even beyond Dante Must Die. In addition to further increasing the amount of damage enemies give and take, every enemy spawns in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Devil Trigger</a> mode and all consumable items and healing items are disabled.

<ul><li> <em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em> also features a Master Ninja mode which is, arguably, even harder than Master Ninja in <em>Black</em> and the leaderboard for Master Ninja in <em>Black</em> had less than 1000 people. It's worth noting that the only requirement to be on this leaderboard was to actually complete Master Ninja mode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em> has a God mode and (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">the sequel</a>) a Titan mode. One section in the latter (the second titan minotaur), which is already hard in normal, becomes a purely luck-based affair. The enemies took more hits and hit harder, you received less orbs, and magic used substantially more magic - the game was not pulling any punches.

On this difficulty, enemies and hazards dole out horrific damage, including regular enemies being able to one-shot you from maximum health, and Mana and health fountains giving back pathetic refills. It almost seems as though this mode was intended to be played on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Resurrection Mode</a>, as both it and the Infernal setting are unlocked after beating the game on any of the normal difficulties.

Hard difficulty increases enemy health and damage taken and drastically changes up the enemy spawns, making tougher enemies spawn earlier.

When you beat the game on Hard, you unlock the 'Non-Stop Infinite Climax' difficulty. It's just like Hard, but you don't get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Witch Time</a> through normal means (that's what the "non-stop" means). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">Have fun with that.</a> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2">Bayonetta 2</a></em> it's just called 'Infinite Climax', since it doesn't disable Witch Time like in the first game ... however that doesn't mean it's any easier; if anything, you'll desperately <em>need</em> Witch Time to stand a chance at this difficulty, because it messes with enemy spawns like in the first game. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of both games (Rodin) are also set in Infinite Climax difficulty and cannot be changed.

Revengeance is similar to Very Hard save for two things: Enemies inflict terrible damage with their attacks, easily killing you in 2-3 blows with a fully upgraded life bar.

The chief difference though, is that time doesn't slow down at all when drawing a Wonder-Liner, which is how one picks an attack. Hope you can get used to not being safe when preparing an attack quickly.

</li><li> Parodied in the Flash game <em>Bobulous</em>. The game has four missions; each but the first unlocked after finishing the one before.

Defeating afflicted enemies earns you S.H.I.E.L.D. tokens for use at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Depot.

The fifth track, which is unlockable along with the fourth, is classified as "Extreme," and is chock full of right-angle turns and other obstacles intended to keep your speed low.

You'll struggle to even get past the first two stages on this setting.

<ul><li> The "Heroic" and "Legendary" levels in every game, with the versions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> described by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> as being "harder than any other <em>Halo</em> game." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">They weren't kidding.</a> (Heck, the Fuel Rod Shades, Revenants, Banshees, and Ghosts in "Pillar of Autumn" can already be an utter pain just on <em>Normal</em>.)
</li><li> This all however is put to the ground as "novice" stuff by the true hardcore of the hardcore of the community. The unnamed, unofficial, yet definitely intentionally programmed to be damned hard to do is the "Mythic" difficulty (otherwise known as "LASO", or "Legendary: All Skulls On"). It involves turning on all skulls in the game. Each skull basically turns up the difficulty in distinct ways by one level in terms of forcing the player to modify their playstyle in order to succeed, and THERE ARE MORE THAN 12 SKULLS. Even the ones that are basically "fun" skulls can still prove fatal if not accounted for, as they do still modify the game. The "Iron" skull even causes you to restart the <em>entire level</em> after dying <em>once</em> if you're playing solo, and some skulls make particularly deadly combinations, such as "Thunderstorm" (which causes all enemy units in the game to rank up) and "Mythic" (which just gives a straight-forward 100% health bonus to the already-hard-to-kill high-ranking enemies). There is an entire community basically made to conquer this hell. Usually less than 100 people in the entire world accomplish the feat, and that's with <a class="urllink" href="http://halo.bungie.org/gameplay/halo3_slaso_2.0/">the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://halo.bungie.org/gameplay/odst_slaso/">community<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>-<a class="urllink" href="http://halo.bungie.org/gameplay/reach_mythic/">built<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://halo.bungie.org/gameplay/halo4_mythic/">guides<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>!

</li></ul></li><li> Even from the start, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series had the oath of the vidmaster, essentially a commitment to play the game as hard as possible. Not only do you only play the hardest difficulty, appropriately named as Total Carnage, but you are also tasked with <em>punching</em> every switch <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wsuw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wsuw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wsuw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Switches would also trigger when shot with certain guns, and some switches cannot be reached, so must be shot.</span> (which can often lead to problems), firing grenades whenever they were available, running by holding a key other than Caps Lock (turning on Always Run in the later Open-Source releases probably counts as the same thing), and killing all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> (who would attack you after a few already died). Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> likes making hard games harder.
</li><li> "Nightmare!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>. Cheat codes are disabled, monsters are relentless in attacking, enemy projectiles fly faster, a certain enemy type (the Pinky demons) is twice as fast, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">monsters respawn after death</a>. The only plus is that you get double ammo from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Power Ups</a>. The fact that the game asks you whether you <em>really</em> want to play on it or not when you select it is telling.
<ul><li> There was once a fan-made difficulty mod that's even harder called "Pray to God." It's just like Nightmare, but you have <em>no</em> weapons other than your pistol!
</li><li> "Nightmare!" was one of the earliest incidents of a difficulty level released with the announced caveat that it was not fully playtested, ergo came with no guarantees that it was fair, or the game was winnable on this level. Many a fanatic player, however, has succeeded in doing so.
</li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Nightmare difficulty was made specifically so that it would be impossible to finish. It is a testament to the dedication/lack of salsa of the gamer community that there are <em>competitions</em>, complete with titles awarded to players who can do just that.
</li><li> Particularly annoying is Doom 1 EP 4, where whole levels can be different depending on what difficulty you're playing as because items are moved around depending on difficulty. Naturally, Nightmare makes these as hard to get as possible.
</li><li> Source ports can separate the two parameters of "Nightmare!" into "fast monsters", that makes the mooks vicious, and "respawning enemies", that is self-explanatory. Those paramenters can be applied regardless of difficulty, so you can customize your gameplay to have, for example, only a few but nasty enemies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">ITYTD</a> with fast monsters), Ultra-Violence with more aggressive demons, Bring 'Em On! that you have to run through because of your non-permanent kills chasing you... or if you're into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, you can play Ultra-Violence with both parameters enabled, so you emulate "Nightmare!" <em>without the double ammo pickups</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>'s Nightmare mode has enemies doing about 3.5 times as much damage as normal, allowing them to kill you in less than a dozen hits or so. Additionally, you also constantly lose health every couple of seconds. To balance this out, your start out with the Soul Cube, which allows you to steal health from enemies.
</li><li> <em>Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil</em>'s Nightmare difficult goes beyond Harder Than Hard and into the realm of truly insane. Just like in regular <em>Doom 3</em>, you constantly lose health throughout the game. Unlike <em>Doom 3</em>, you don't have the Soul Cube around to steal health from enemies. As a result, you pretty much spend the entire game as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, with death being instant if you ever take a single hit from any enemy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with Ultra-Nightmare. It's just like Nightmare, except you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">only one life</a>; if you die, your save file is deleted and a small marker is placed showing how far you got if you're playing online. It's rather telling that most of the markers you find will be in the <em>very first combat arena</em> - a mere imp can kill you in a single melee attack if you don't have armor.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em> has its Insane difficulty. The enemies have learned how to fire faster than you, dodge better than you, flank better than you, thus nearly all the enemies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>, especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Bats</a> in the second game, and all the powerups that are so vital to your survival are now pathetically ineffective. As an added bonus, your weapons take much more energy to use than normal, so you can easily run out of ammunition. And on the second game's Insane, the matcens (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">mook makers</a>) are inexhaustible.
<ul><li> In the PSX games, the Ace and Insane difficulties are hidden and must be unlocked via code. Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">framerate drops</a> when there are a lot of enemies on screen, and the even faster speed of projectiles such as missiles, Insane may be literally unbeatable here.

<ul><li> The other two Prime games are similar. Making your way through the game on the hardest is tougher than normal. Enemies become much smarter (Space Pirates are much more likely to gun you down from a distance and dodge your fire for example), they soak up much more damage and Samus herself takes much more damage from pretty much everything. The difficulty really spikes on final bosses though, especially Prime 3's final boss.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> has Tourist ("for non-FPS players"), Easy ("for non-experienced FPS players"), Normal ("for experienced FPS players"), Hard ("for experienced <em>Serious Sam</em> players"), and Serious ("Are you serious?"). Beating the game unlocks Mental difficulty ("You can't be serious!"), which is as advertised because all the enemies <em>are friggin invisible</em>!!!
</li><li> The description for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>'s "Veteran" difficulty is "You will not survive". They're not kidding. Even worse in the expansion <em>United Offensive</em>, due to the sheer number of enemy soldiers at points.
<ul><li> Not to mention <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Call Of Duty 4</a>'s</em> Veteran, where enemies killed frequently hold out to draw their pistol and two-shot you. Staying out of cover for more than two seconds is entirely suicidal.
<ul><li> Speaking of cover, the enemies don't like when they can't shoot you. Their solution is to herd you from your safe hiding place with LOTS of grenades. There are many points where you're given the choice between getting fragged or getting ripped up by a machine gun.
</li><li> This was particularly aggravating in "World at War", by Treyarch. In that game, if you didn't proceed forward fast enough, the game would try to get you to move by spawning grenades near you, even if you already killed all the enemies in the level. They came more frequently on harder difficulty levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare2">Modern Warfare 2</a></em>'s Veteran is available to be picked in Special Ops. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">"Casual" difficulty Recruit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">is not.</a> No matter the implications of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Veteran is still going to kick the ass of people who play on the very hard difficulties.</a> In addition, Special Ops stays the same difficulty-wise regardless of if you play solo, or two-player coop. Trying to play Veteran Special Ops without a second player is akin to bungee jumping without a bungee cord. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Your chance of survival is about the same.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> To sum up how the difficulty feels during gameplay, here are the basics:
<ul><li> On Recruit, the game is more or less a gritty action film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> miss a lot, and their rounds aren't all that damaging. Timed objectives give out substantially more time. The number of enemies is dramatically reduced. Basically, it's very easy to do a no-death run.
</li><li> On Regular, the game offers a standard level of challenge and you will likely die a few times, but most situations can be won in a few tries with enough firepower and cover. So long as you don't make a habit of disregarding cover, then the game isn't all that hard.
</li><li> On Hardened, the game becomes a real challenge. There are more enemies, they hit more frequently, and can kill you in a few hits. You may need to get creative in how you deal with situations. The game is fair, so except for very few occasions, the game is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, and the computer will not cheat.
</li><li> Veteran is close to impossible. Enemies come in much higher numbers, have noticeably more health, have much better aim, and to top it all off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a> and only lets you win on rare occasions. This is at least 2x harder than Hardened. Here, enemies love to survive what ought to be lethal wounds, go into last stand mode, and most infuriatingly, suddenly kill you with three rapid shots in such close succession that you can't do anything. Even more annoying is that the odds of being suddenly and unfairly killed increase inversely proportionally to the number of enemies remaining, so you can down four mooks at the start of a fight with no trouble, but the last enemy kills you the moment you stick your head out of cover!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a></em> takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by introducing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Realistic difficulty,</a> which turns you into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">luck</a>.</strong>

Helmets are your ONLY protection from headshots, take up one equipment slot, and are destroyed upon being hit. There is no automatic magazine reloading. If you get shot in the legs, you can't sprint. If you get shot in the arms, you have trouble using two-handed weapons and using ADS. No automatic health regeneration, meaning that you can only heal using nano-shots, which are stupid rare and take up equipment slots. Checkpoints are drastically reduced. Did we also mention that your gun can be shot out of your hands? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/LoreInAMinute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/LoreInAMinute">fun.</a>
<ul><li> And then there's IW's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">#YOLO</a> mode. It's just as hard as Specialist, with a twist. No points for guessing what it is.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a></em> (2008) has Normal, Hard, and Inhuman difficulties. Inhuman takes away your ability to instant-knife-kill dinosaurs, and also allows enemy soldiers to kill you with about half a second of sustained gunfire. So basically, just like how it'd be in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a> 2</em> adds 'Impossible' with the final patch. Players start with a mere trickle of health and gain laughable amounts with Endurance increases, making the Tank bonus upgrade an absolute must. Skills and abilities cost an absolutely prohibitive amount of cyber modules past the first level, and as a result hacking skill is ridiculously expensive to purchase - this is a moot point however, as hacking difficulty starts at an insane higher than 100% chance of failure on average before bonuses, and several security consoles are removed altogether in key areas loaded with cameras and turrets. Enemies are faster to hit, and learn new attack techniques. Vending machines also charge more than ever, and stop selling the recycler item that could earn you more money on easier settings. This is one Impossible setting that complies with truth in advertising.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em>'s difficulty levels are named Daydream, Insomnia (normal), Nightmare, and Trauma. You have to beat Insomnia and get all the Black Tarot cards in order to unlock Nightmare, and you have to do the same on Nightmare to get to Trauma. On Trauma, there are no quicksaves, and no souls. That's right, the souls enemies release that give you that vital + 1 health bonus when you pick them up and turn you into an invincible demon every time you get 66 of them are no longer in the game.
<ul><li> And of course, this is the only way to unlock all the levels (Prison and Forest unlock on Nightmare and Trauma, respectively) get all the Black Tarot cards and see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Good Ending</a>... which isn't canon as of the expansion pack, but it's the thought that counts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1">Far Cry 1</a></em>'s "Realistic". First off, the game is already more challenging than most at the default levels, this just makes it worse. If you don't know how to take cover properly, or know where the armor is, you're fucked. Realistic difficulty dramatically increases the damage enemies do to your health, causing you to die after only a couple shots if you're not wearing armor. Which is, of course, realistic. (Your armor itself can still take several hits before failing, so the game is still beatable as long as you can find armor). However, realistic difficulty <em>also</em> <strong>increases</strong> the damage that enemies can take, so that even the basic grunts wearing nothing but a t-shirt can soak several assault rifle bullets before dying. Which is, obviously, not so realistic.
</li><li> "Infamous" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> is roughly as close to reality as the game will get: running checkpoints or trying to take them out by rolling into them blazing away on the gun of your truck/boat is a good way to get ventilated within seconds, forcing players to sneak up on them and perform massive one-man ambushes with explosives and fire. Enemies are experts at seeking you out when you hide in buildings, turning stealth from a neat way to play into a necessity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> has Delta difficulty, which is <em>supposed</em> to be Harder Than Hard, as your health regenerates <em>much</em> more slowly. Additionally, there are a bunch of little handicaps such as no crosshair without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight">Laser Sight</a> or iron sights, you can't drive a vehicle and operate the rooftop machinegun turret at the same time, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">enemies all speak Korean</a>, making it harder for the player to gauge their moves. While Delta is generally considered the hardest difficultly, it also reduces every human character's health to more realistic levels, shifting the game closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a>.
<ul><li> Delta is referred to as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">Bauer</a> mode in the game files.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis2">Crysis2</a></em> has this not for the players but for their computers. The graphic quality presets start with "high" and then go up from there ("very high", "ultra high", "extreme").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a></em> games have the harder-than-hard "Master" difficulty. It's perfect for people who have mastered the game on lower difficulty levels and know how to gain advantages over enemies who can take and inflict damage on par with the player but are much more numerous. People who don't know how to pull this off might as well map quickload and quicksave to a mouse button. Actually, scratch that: even people who DO know to pull this off will have to spend a lot of time reloading, because it takes only a <em>moment</em> of inattention to have your brains blown out. Just to set a parameter, the game is already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> on the <em>easy</em> difficulty setting. And some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modders</a> have released mod packs, notably <em>MISERY</em> and <em>Oblivion Lost</em>, that make the games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even harder</a></em>.
<ul><li> Bizarrely enough, Stalker fans consider "Master" easy, as it lowers the amount of health that human characters have, making them easier to kill, turning it into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em>'s Harder Than Hard mode takes advantage of the game's in-game difficulty selection (in other words, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel">Hub Level</a>), with the "Nightmare" difficulty only accessible through a secret hidden inside a magical pond. Then again, unlike <em>Doom</em> or many other examples here, the <em>Quake</em> Nightmare difficulty has few player handicaps and is in fact only slightly less manageable than Hard: the only additions are enemies attacking with relentless frequency and tending to stand still if they have a ranged attack, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">immunity to stuns</a> for five seconds after the first flinch.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em>'s Hard+ mode is even more well hidden, accessible only through the console outside of a source port. Unlike the first <em>Quake</em>, this one is significantly tougher than the "normal" Hard difficulty: enemies are faster and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">surprisingly intelligent</a>, have higher HP, their weapons deal much more damage, and they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">Immune to Flinching</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em> had the General difficulty. Enemies did 3.5 times as much damage as normal, and thus could kill you in just a few hits if you didn't have armor (and you didn't even GET armor until after 2 or 3 levels). Even with armor, you could still die after just several hits. Enemies also had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge">significantly more health</a>, to the point that even mid-level enemies like the Berserkers and Gunners required more than a full mag of assault rifle fire to kill. Finally, your Rhino Squad squadmates die at the drop of a hat, turning previously fun firefights into tedious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">escort missions</a>, since you got an automatic game over if any of them ever died. Thankfully, unlike the game's spiritual predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, your health does not automatically tick down over time so it's possible to avert the frustration of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a></em> has the Unfair difficulty, where the noise meter is much more sensitive than on lower difficulty levels, making it much easier to spike it and get tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">Respawning Enemies</a>. In fact enemies can randomly spawn as soon as the PADD meter reaches halfway or so. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, but not quite as unfair as Doom's Nightmare difficulty.
<ul><li> Even worse: <em>SOF2</em>'s Soldier Of Fortune difficulty, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> Hell, although there aren't many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">Respawning Enemies</a>. The normal difficulties are already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, this goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to their three standard difficulty settings, both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> feature unlockable difficulty settings (called "007" and "Perfect Dark" respectively) that allow the player to alter the challenge by fine-tuning certain enemy properties: their health, accuracy, damage and reaction times. This allows players to set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> that is far harder than the standard difficulty settings. Level runs done with minimum enemy health and all other settings on maximum (meaning both player and perfectly-accurate guards will die in a single hit) are known as "Licence to Kill" (LTK) settings. Runs with <em>everything</em> set to maximum, so that guards have <em>ten times more health than normal</em>, are known as "Dark LTK" runs. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> this is stupidly hard since a dead foe doesn't drop enough ammo to kill the next one (though it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy85PlckrW0">is possible to complete certain levels<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; in Perfect Dark it's <em>marginally</em> more manageable thanks to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">"quirk"</a> that headshots on unshielded NPCs are always instant kills.
<ul><li> Said customisable difficulties can also be used in conjunction with the games' many unlockable cheat options, some of which make the game harder: the "Enemy Rockets" cheat, for example, arms every enemy in each game with a rocket launcher with infinite ammo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em>'s multiplayer mode allows players to set up deathmatches that involve bots of varying behaviour and difficulty level. "PerfectSims" and "DarkSims" have near-perfect accuracy and reaction times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDarkZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDarkZero">Perfect Dark Zero</a></em> features an unlockable fourth difficulty setting, "Dark Agent", which does away with the semi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a> feature.
</li><li> While the remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii">GoldenEye Wii</a></em> has more modern trappings of FPSes like regenerating health, there's "007 Classic" mode, complete with health bar and armor pickups. True to this trope, it's also the hardest difficulty level of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> has Easy, Normal, Advanced, and Expert. On Expert, The common infected deal 20 damage per hit, Hunters and Smokers do at least 30 damage per hit, Tanks can incapacitate a Survivor in one hit and then kill in two hits, and the Witch will instantly kill you if provoked. Friendly fire damage is significantly increased where a stray shotgun blast or few bullets can incap a Survivor.
<ul><li> And if the Director feels like being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> on Expert, he will spawn special infected on you <em>repeatedly</em> and/or keep spawning Tanks right in the beginning of the level. In fact, this is one of the factors in the difficulty setting - on lower difficulties, if the Director rolls a spawn combination that it thinks is unfair, it discards that combination and rerolls. On Expert, <em>all</em> rolls are used.
</li><li> The sequel sports Realism mode, which is a <em>mode of play</em> instead of difficulty. Realism mode removes the colored auras around allies and items, making communication about who and what is where a must. Head shots to zombies are now more vital than ever since it will do more damage and more likely to kill in one shot than two shotgun blasts to the torso. To top it off, you can play Realism mode on any difficulty setting, including the already hard as hell Expert setting.
</li></ul></li><li> The PS3 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> and the remastered version included in <em>BioShock: The Collection</em>, in addition to the Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties, has Survivor mode, which is described on the difficulty selection screen as "Every bullet counts." The very first enemy will kill you. And one of the trophies asks you to beat the game on Survivor without using Vita-chambers. This trophy is fittingly called "I Chose the Impossible."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> has 1999 Mode.

You are also forced to choose a weapon specialization that can't be changed again. Resources are more difficult to find, with Elizabeth taking longer to toss you items. Enemies deal more damage and have more health, with even your regular garden-variety mook being able to overthrow you without difficulty. Even an enemy with a simple wooden baseball bat can take away ¼ of your health on a single strike. Let alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Handymen</a>. To put the cherry on top, the achievement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">Scavenger Hunt</a> requires you to beat this difficulty without using any Dollar Bill vending machines. And on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee">zeppelin defense</a> level? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">May God have mercy on your soul.</a> Goddamn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">Rocket Launchers</a>. Seeking cover regularly, managing resources wisely, knowing the Infusion locations and also being filthy rich is the only way you are beating this difficulty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone">Killzone</a> 2</em>. Let's see, Veteran makes the Helghast a pain in the ass to kill (your normally powerful side-arm is now worthless, and they can take four shots to the head - if you don't wind up shooting them in the neck), and amps the damage (if you're out of cover for more than five seconds, <strong>YOU WILL DIE</strong>). <em>Coupled with a crappy cover system, where it can take precious seconds to stick and unstick from a wall while Helghast happily round the corner and shoot you, AND a jerky aim that can't be fixed.</em> Now, picture this in Elite, where, in one or two shots, you die. With a long regen time, and <em>cover that can blow apart in certain levels</em>. Also, did we mention no reticule?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em> had Extreme difficulty, in which you had roughly the same durability as the basic Repica Soldier, while being outnumbered by them by a few hundred to one. If you use your slow-motion power, it's just fairly challenging, but you try to beat the game without Slo-Mo it's crazy hard.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em>Project Origin</em>, originally just had Easy, Normal, and Hard. However, the 1.02 patch for the game transformed Hard mode into Harder Than Hard by significantly increasing the damage done by enemy attacks, to the point that you died after just 8-10 bullet hits or 2 shotgun blasts or sniper rifle shots. Again, it's still manageable if you use Slo-Mo, but certain fights (most noticeably the final shootout) are super annoying.
</li><li> The threequel, although easier than its predecessors, still has a harder-than-hard difficulty in the form of Insane mode, which is unlocked by completing the game on a lower setting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensVsPredator2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensVsPredator2010">Aliens vs. Predator (2010)</a></em> has Nightmare difficulty. It's just like Hard (enemies do increased damage, have higher health, command prompts no longer appear on screen to tell you when to block or counter, aliens can no longer be knocked down in melee, and marines are much more aware of their surroundings) with the added handicap that there <em>are no checkpoints</em>, so if you die at any point in a level you have to start over from the very beginning.
</li><li> When you beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">Killer7</a></em>, you get access to "Killer 8". In it you get an additional character with both a clip size and rate of fire drastically larger than any of the normal caricatures. However, the down side is that the enemies are faster and more deadly; just shooting at them normally does almost nothing, the weak points that you use to kill them instantly are now completely invisible, and the enemies give you less "blood" to level up and heal with.
<ul><li> Oh, and that extra character? He has a metric ton of health (to the point that he's the only character besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Mask</a> who can take more than one hit in this mode,) but on the flip side, since resurrecting dead characters requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing">Button Mashing</a> as fast as you can until refill their health gauge, you better make damn sure he doesn't die if you value your thumbs.
</li></ul></li><li> The first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms">Brothers in Arms</a></em> games have Easy, Normal, Difficult, and Authentic difficulty modes. To unlock Authentic mode, the whole game must first be completed on Difficult mode. <em>Hell's Highway</em> has only three difficulties: Casual, Veteran and Authentic. In this game, to unlock Authentic mode, you just need to finish the game once. Regardless of the game, in Authentic mode, the difficulty is set very high, there are no save checkpoints, and suppression indicators are turned off by default, to make the game as close to an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> battlefield as possible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has Easy, Normal, Hard, and OVERKILL. Playing on easier difficulties would lock you out of certain heists, though a patch was made to allow all heists to be playable on at least Normal. Reaching the level cap of 145 would unlock OVERKILL 145+: enemies do more damage, have more health, and your bleedout timer is almost nonexistent after the first incapacitation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY 2</a></em> features a unique spin on this. The difficulties cover Normal, Hard, Very Hard and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">OVERKILL</a>, with higher difficulty stacking higher rewards with greater opposition. However, should you level enough, PRO Heists become available on Hard and above; for even larger prizes, the game throws numerous curve-balls at the players, such as extra objectives, changes to the map, and/or other variables mixed in with even harder difficulties <em>and with little warning</em>.
<ul><li> And then Overkill went and added the aptly-named Death Wish difficulty. The cameras on most maps are replaced with indestructible Titan cameras, security is increased, and little curve balls are thrown your way to make stealthing a heist much, <em>much</em> harder. The assault waves are no better, with new Gensec Elite SWAT troopers that can tear through armor and health in the blink of an eye. And as if that wasn't painful enough, they went and added an even tougher-to-kill Bulldozer. One that's even more heavily armored, and comes armed with a <em>light machine gun</em>.
</li><li> Then in 2016, two more Harder Than Hard difficulties were added. Mayhem and One Down. Mayhem acts as a sort of bridge between Overkill and Deathwish. Harder than the former, not quite as hard as the latter. One Down is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: Get downed after already being downed once, you're done. Oh, and the enemies are even meaner and tougher than on Death Wish.
</li><li> And <em>then</em> in 2018, Overkill released an update that, among other things, reworked One Down entirely. Now called Death Sentence, you no longer have to worry about only having one down when playing on this difficulty, and enemy health across the board has been lowered by a third. But that's where the good news ends, as the spawn rate for special enemies, including the dreaded Bulldozers, has been increased a fair bit, and their damage output remains the same as before. And speaking of Bulldozers, their health has been doubled, and can now spawn in two extra flavours that were previously exclusive to Crime Spree: Medic Dozers, which combine the abilities and threat of the existing Medic and Dozer enemies into one deadly package, as well as Minigun Dozers, which use their gatling guns to cause a metric shitton of damage to the player (the latter can also spawn on Death Wish, by the way). Oh, and there's now a modifier to enable the One Down setting on any difficulty. <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToHell">Welcome to Hell</a></strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Metro2033" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Metro2033">Metro 2033</a></em> has the 'Ranger' difficulty levels, which are associated with their own achievements. Notably, it's not so much just 'difficult' as 'realistic': Ranger Easy disables your HUD and thus things like ammo counter and the crosshair (you have to use your watch or journal to know how much ammo you have left) and reducing looted ammo from clips of ten-plus bullets to one or two bullets apiece, making resource management a must. At this point, it becomes far more practical to depend on your knife for almost every single encounter, reserving your extremely scarce ammunition for dire emergencies. Using stealth practically becomes a requirement to deal with human enemies, who will otherwise kill you in extremely short order. 'Ranger Hardcore' ramps this up by making you even more fragile; one or two bullets will usually kill you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">though on the flip side most enemies die from one or two shots as well</a>. However, due to the extreme scarcity of ammunition (100 dirty 5.45x39mm rounds might be all you find in an entire PLAYTHROUGH), you're going to end up using your knife for almost absolutely every single fight. Enemies are also more alert, making stealth essential but difficult.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight">Metro: Last Light</a></em> brings back the ranger difficulty modes. And things are worse this time around, because human enemies, who were the bane of your existence in Ranger Mode in 2033, but were mercifully rare, are much more prevalent in this game.
</li></ul></li><li> Originally, the highest difficulty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal2">Postal 2</a></em> was Hestonworld, in which enemies did twice as much damage and every character in the game world was armed with a weapon. However, since they remained non-hostile towards you until you provoked them, if you used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame">semi-stealthy playstyle</a> it could actually make the game easier, as the now-armed civilians would end up killing many of your enemies for you. The patch to the game added the They Hate Me difficulty, which was truly Harder Than Hard as it caused every character with a gun (including cops, neutrals, and allies) to automatically try to kill you on sight. The later <em>Week in Paradise</em> and <em>Complete</em> releases went even further with "Nightmare!/POSTAL!" and "Really Fucking Hard/Impossible" difficulties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vietcong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vietcong">Vietcong</a></em>'s Vietnam difficulty. Like the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> example above, it has no HUD, no quicksaves or autosaves. And you thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">the game was already very hard</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillingFloor">Killing Floor</a></em> started with Beginner, Normal, Hard, and Suicidal. Then owners of the game were complaining that Suicidal became too easy, so in its 2010 Christmas event, Tripwire Interactive added in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Hell on Earth</a>, which further increases the damage and health boost given to enemies from Suicidal and retroactively nerfs the starting pistol as well as increasing the duration of the Fleshpound's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">blitz of death</a> on top of other conditions set in Suicidal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> has Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. In this mode, all enemies are at <em>four times</em> as much health as True Vault Hunter Mode and <em>regenerating health</em>. This sometimes makes it impossible to kill an enemy without using Slag damage amplification. Luckily, slag DOES give you three times damage amplification for non-slag guns, but generally makes you have a slag weapon on you at all times (Magic Missile grenade mod and Slagga anyone?).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> 6</em>, two additional modes can be unlocked beyond the standard-issue Easy/Normal/Hard. Those are 'Master' and 'Chaos'. Considering the way the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> games always work, I bet you figure you can just level a character to 50 in Free Play, and then use him to sweep through Chaos Mode with ease, right? Well, let's just say that Chaos Mode is DESIGNED for level 50 characters. And even with super high level characters, Chaos is absurdly difficult. You could spend 30 minutes playing perfectly, dancing around the enemy officers and picking them apart one at a time until there is just the head general left...Oh and that generic officer you bypassed 15 minutes ago, who's been chasing you the whole time, and is dashing at you right now. Oh look, he just pulled off a one hit kill.
</li><li> Some of the games, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em> games, have had Very Easy and (in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a></em> games) Chaos as the only one above Hard. The names in the Japanese versions? <em>Heaven</em> and <em>Hell</em>.
</li><li> <em>Chaos</em> difficulty, in <em>Warriors Orochi</em> at least, is no different from Hard, for the most part. Enemies have the same HP (more or less), AI is the same, they deal the same amount of damage... the only difference is that their attacks completely ignore defence. A regular mook can now kill you in four hits. And did we mention you will often be surrounded by a few <em>hundred</em> mooks, with a few officers in the middle to spice things up? Enjoy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> is an interesting case.

Inferno was added to be the ultimate challenge, and when the game first came out the developers weren't sure it was even going to be possible to beat the game at that difficulty. The players did, of course. Eventually they nerfed and retooled the system, ultimately replacing it with an entirely new set of difficulty tiers: "Normal," "Hard," "Expert," "Master," and "Torment I" - "Torment VI," which ultimately means that Diablo III has 8 levels of harder than hard. Ultimately, though, even the most casual player will be able to function on Torment I with little trouble once they've hit the maximum level cap and gotten leveled gear. The Torment track has since been retooled to go as high as Torment X. This, however, isn't even the highest challenge in the game. The game also has timed "Greater Rifts" that go from 1 to 100 with Greater Rift 37 being roughly equivalent to Torment X. Such high Greater Rift levels are only reachable, besides exceptional skill, by playing the right class with the right combination of skills and items that happen to be rolled exceptionally well.

Normal and Hard are the beginner-friendly contents that can be cleared with just a few weeks of grinding, depending on the player's characters, weapons, and summons. Showdown Raids are tailored for up to 30-man raids and the bosses can have millions of HP. But given the maximum number of participants up to 30, there is a high chance of success as long as everyone contributes bufffs, debuffs, and damage outputs. But this trope directly applies to the latter two: Impossible raids are like the Showdown-level raids, but the bosses have way more millions of HP, attack patterns, and will sometimes include sub-bosses. Nightmare raids are also like the Showdown-level raids, having almost the same millions of HP and attacks, but the player will have to fight the boss alone, with no back-up from other players.

He earned his quasi-official title and tagline of "the Raid Destroyer" and "He feeds on your tears".
<ul><li> "He Feeds On Your Tears" is also the name of a special achievement where you have to defeat him on your first try without anyone dying. Then there's "Herald of the Titans" that requires you defeating him only using gear that has nothing better than what drops in 10-man Ulduar - this one is a 10man only achievement.
<ul><li> The Argent Coliseum also has a similar achievement on 10-man mode, where you have to complete the raid without a single wipe and only wearing gear you could obtain up to and in Coliseum 10-man.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> introduced Challenge Modes for 5-man dungeons.
<ul><li> Powerful gear is scaled down to a fixed point. More gear won't help you here.
</li><li> Everything hits harder. Some things are deadly if not appropriately handled.
</li><li> You cannot use the auto group filler.
</li><li> It is timed (with a leader board), although you still get rewarded for completing it despite the timer.
</li><li> To avoid excessive exploiting there is a quota to kill some non-boss NPCs.
</li><li> To avoid distractions, enemies drop no loot. Only the completion grants a reward.
</li><li> To encourage rapid attempts, you can reset the dungeon at any time and take no durability damage from death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> shuffled around the raid difficulties. Old Flexible became Normal. Old Normal became Heroic. Old Heroic became Mythic. But since they went to a single fixed size with Mythic (20 players), it enabled Blizzard to add unique mechanics that require certain class abilities to deal with. Mythic difficulty is truly "harder than hard" and is pretty much designed for the top 1% of the playerbase.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> removed the Challenge Mode system from dungeons and implemented the Mythic Plus system. Players receive keys which activate the mode, which gain levels on successfully completing a dungeon and lose a level on failing it. Completing higher level Mythic Plus keys offers increased rewards from the chest at the end of the dungeon and a weekly cache.
<ul><li> Each dungeon has a fixed timer based on its overall length. Each player death reduces the timer by 5 seconds.
</li><li> The base health and damage of enemies is increased based on the level of the key.
</li><li> Three affixes that modify the dungeon experience are applied based on the level of the key. Examples include spawning additional trash mobs, boosting the stats of bosses, and reducing the ability of tanks to hold aggro.
</li><li> As in Challenge Mode, players are required to kill a certain amount of trash mobs in addition to the bosses.
</li><li> Players cannot change talents.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RustyHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RustyHearts">Rusty Hearts</a></em>, all dungeons starting with the Wine Cellar have a difficulty tier above "Very Hard" called "Blood" mode, which can only be entered after reaching a high enough level (and meeting certain other conditions). Enemies in Blood-level dungeons are several levels higher than their Very Hard counterparts, and they attack far more aggressively. You also don't get experience points or gold for defeating enemies, but they do leave behind high-quality items that you wouldn't otherwise receive even on Very Hard.
</li><li> The five Secret Dungeons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword">Elsword</a></em> are generally harder than the normal dungeons of their respective towns, and come with a <strong>Hell</strong> difficulty. However, there is a chance for an NPC named Luto to appear in any room in the dungeon, and if you break the door he summons, you get sent back to the beginning of the dungeon, in <strong>Luto Mode</strong>. Enemies are even more dangerous in this mode, and with the difficulty scaled to match that of the highest-leveled party member, if you have a capped character in your party it's going to be one bumpy ride.
</li><li> Offered in multiple flavors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>. Each Primal has an "extreme" mode with more health, damage, and whole new mechanics while still keeping to the theme of the original fight. The endgame raid of 2.0 "The Binding Coil of Bahamut" was this as well, and part two of the raid chain had Savage Mode, which gave you nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Rewards</a> titles for clearing. The 3.0 endgame raid Alexander was designed with a normal and savage mode in mind, so that not only could more people play through the plot, but they could make the Savage mode even more facemeltingly difficult without alienating the less hardcore players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> has most Operations available on Story, Hard and Nightmare difficulties. Nightmare adds new mechanics to existing encounters, occasionally adds some new encounters and grants access to achievements that the other difficulties don't have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> modes for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">ascension</a> system. The most infamous one is "Bad Moon," and it's a doozy.
<ul><li> Unlike all other special game modes, Bad Moon is not available by default—to access it you must beat the whole game without using any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLeafClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLeafClover">ten-leaf clovers</a>, creating no small amount of tediousness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">The game never tells you</a> there's any benefit to avoiding clovers, or that Bad Moon even exists, until you do this.
</li><li> Once you're in Bad Moon, the "fun" begins. All the skills, familiars, and so on you've accumulated in previous playthroughs, which you'd normally use to make the game easier/faster, is unavailable. Even your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">paid content</a> is unusable. New adventures show up in various places, which give you weird combinations of buffs and debuffs (some can be useful if you know where to find them, but most are negative). Even if you follow the best possible strategy, it will probably take you a couple of weeks to beat the game (normal runs can be done in a few days without much effort).
</li><li> If, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">for some reason</a>, you want permanent access to Bad Moon, you must take the difficulty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by using the Black Cat familiar for the entire run. The cat will screw with you in combat to a ridiculous degree—randomly blocking your skills and items, stealing MP, cancelling your self-buffs, etc.—and just to add insult to injury, at the end of each fight it will randomly swat item drops into a sewer drain and distract you so you don't gain as much experience from winning the fight. Once again, the game does not tell you there's any reason to subject yourself to this, nor does it tell you where to get the Black Cat (it's in Noob Cave, a place you don't normally have any reason to visit).
</li></ul></li><li> In 2005 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> released the TzHaar Fight Cave. If you can survive 62 waves (which translates into over two hours) of monsters steadily increasing in difficulty then you will find yourself faced with TzTok-Jad, a level 702 boss monster (at the time the highest level in the game by a wide margin) that uses multiple styles of attack with a maximum hit of 98 (for reference, the highest hitpoint level is 99). Because too many people were defeating Jad and devaluing the impressiveness of the reward for doing so, the fire cape (at the time of writing this the lowest level player to complete the minigame had only 25 combat), the developers of Old School Runescape decided in 2017 to release The Inferno which includes 68 waves of increasing difficulty (including multiple JalTok-Jads, a stronger version of TzTok-Jad) culminating in a final boss battle with TzKal-Zuk, a monster with twice the combat level of TzTok-Jad (plus another JalTok-Jad thrown in for fun once TzKal-Zuk's health has been lowered enough).

The idea is to man up and pretend Hard is the default difficulty.
</li><li> "Impossible" is so hard that the creator of the game was publicly shocked to find out that someone had actually beaten the game on Impossible. The first official comment was "holy crap your not serious are you" (sic). To date, the number of people who are confirmed to have managed to beat the game on Impossible can be counted on one hand.

In Ultra V-Rated pretty much anything can kill you in one hit, and you lose the hit markers that show if the enemy is going to attack high or low. In fairness, enemies all have unique tells for if they're going for a high or low attack, so losing the hit markers means little if you're paying attention. However, you likely WILL die against each new kind of enemy you find until you learn its tells. Fire Leo, however, becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, since the only tells during his spin attack are audio cues with only subtle differences between them.

<ul><li> Remember Palm Tree Paradise, the stage with the relaxing background vocals and pretty much the easiest aside from entry stage? On Super Hard mode you trip the Frog Switch <em>as soon as you enter the stage</em>.

There's a Super Hard, but you don't get anything for your trouble except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">a code to use a special character in Vs mode</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, <em>Pokémon Puzzle Challenge</em> has Super Hard and Intense above Hard.
</li></ul></li><li> After beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon">Tetris Attack</a> on Hard, you get a series of buttons to press that will allow you to play the game on Very Hard. Interestingly, the difficulty is still listed as Hard during the game, but you know the code worked because the difficulty-select screen's background turns red (and the enemies really are quite brutal).
<ul><li> In the Japan-only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a> sequel, beating Hard difficulty gives you the code for <em>Super Hard</em> difficulty, which is colored red like the preceding example. Clearing THAT will give you the code for <em>Very Hard</em>, which is colored black and will put your skills to the ultimate test.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster">Tetris: The Grand Master</a> ACE</em>'s 150-line time attack mode has Normal, with somewhat <em>TGM</em>-esque speed curve. Hi-Speed 1 starts the game off at somewhat high speed, Hi-Speed 2 starts the game off at instant-drop speed. Then there's Another mode, in which the game starts off at instant-drop and timings shrink down with more line clears, similar to Death mode from TGM2. <em>Then</em> there's Another 2, which constantly remains at Another's maximum speed.
</li><li> The NES and Game Boy iterations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> typically only allow you to start as high as level 9. However, a simple code allows you to set the starting level as high as 19.
</li><li> The puzzle game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a> Star Stacker</em> has "Normal" (Represented by a happy Kirby face), "Hard" (Hesitant), "Very Hard" (Angry), and "Super Hard" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop">Eye Pop</a>) difficulty levels. If you clear all of the puzzles on those levels, you get the aptly-named "Insane!" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes">Wingding Eyes</a>) difficulty. On "Insane!", the clear objectives rarely ever drop below 100, there are no intermissions between stages, and you have to clear 50 puzzles (as opposed to 16 on the previous difficulty levels) in order to win the game. Scoring exceptionally well on the Score Attack and Time Attack modes also unlocks their own "Insane!" difficulty, where drop speed and line clear speed are always maxed out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMario">Dr. Mario</a> 64</em> allows you to press two specific buttons to play on Super Hard difficulty, which doesn't pull punches, as you'd expect. In the Multiplayer, you can also press two combinations of buttons to ramp up the computer opponents to Hard and Super Hard as well. Good luck trying to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Rudy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Metal Mario, and Vampire Wario</a> like this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperHexagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperHexagon">Super Hexagon</a></em> has six difficulty levels. The first three are "Hard", "Harder", and "Hardest". Yeah that's right, the first difficulty level is Hard, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">appropriately so</a>. The unlockable ones are "Hardester", "Hardestest", and "Hardestestest".

<ul><li> "Brutal" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>: Generals</em>, though it should be noted that the game features no "Easy".
<ul><li> <em>C&amp;C 3: Tiberium Wars</em> adds AI personality modes, including a special mode called "Steamroller". Beating a Brutal Steamroller AI in a duel is a serious challenge even for highly experienced C&amp;C players (but mostly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>). The Xbox 360 version takes the AI difficulties from the PC version and adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">forty levels of ass-kicking.</a> The <em>medium</em> difficulty setting will have an AI spamming you with Mammoth Tanks inside of <em>five minutes.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em> is a particularly amusing example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a>'s tendency to have little ditties referring to each level's difficulty setting; beating the game on higher levels would apparently give your character greater notoriety - from "The taste of success will turn to ashes in your mouth" to "In an age not yet dawned, your name will be spoken of as a God!"
</li><li> When adding AI Bots to a skirmish game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em>, the difficulty modes for each AI run from Easy to Hard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">Cheater</a>.
<ul><li> It gets better in the Forged Alliance expansion pack - to provide a challenge for the elite tournament-level players, even the 'normal' difficulty setting plays with maximum efficiency. Said tournament-level players will wipe the floor with its bad tactical decisions, but the other 99% of the player base will wonder how the hell to get rid of the strike-force sized tank squadron that comes knocking on your doorstep two minutes in. Needless to say, the cheating AI levels are just brutal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlagueInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlagueInc">Plague Inc.</a></em> and <em>Plague Inc: Evolved</em> has Mega-Brutal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in the difficulty's description: "For players who thought Brutal was Casual!"

Level 10 is appropriately named "Doom." ("Hard" is level 8). In the sequel, even <em>one</em> level-10 AI being beaten without an excess of cheese is to be reported as a bug, and several of the greatest intelligence improvements have come from those reports.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Rhythm Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteBeatAgents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteBeatAgents">Elite Beat Agents</a></em> for the DS has "Breezin'" and "Cruisin'" which are available when the game starts. Beating "Cruisin'" unlocks "Sweatin'". Beating "Sweatin'" (a feat in itself) unlocks "Hard Rock". Each difficulty has its own main character with the same two sidekicks for the first three difficulties. "Hard Rock" replaces the Agents with the Divas (basically their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>). Interestingly, Hard Rock is just Sweatin' with smaller buttons, a quicker pace, and of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">everything is backwards</a>. Have fun.
<ul><li> The Japanese game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OsuTatakaeOuendan">Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</a></em> has the exact same difficulty structure (though named "Light-heartedly", "Boldly", "Fervently", and "Gracefully" Cheer, from easiest), as <em>EBA</em> was a localized port of <em>Ouendan</em>. <em>Ouendan</em> is more difficult overall though, as you cannot review a level when you fail to see how to improve, and you can't skip the cutscenes - groan. Oh, and you know how much the spinners are a pain in <em>EBA</em>? They were specifically made <em>easier</em> than they were in <em>Ouendan</em>. On top of that, while all of EBA's Hard ROCK! charts are the same as Sweatin's, only turned 180 degrees, some of <em>Ouendan</em>'s Very Hard charts not only do that, but also make alterations to some of the charts; notes that are normally stacked will now be spread out, and the fourth part of "Shanghai Honey" now has notes at eighth-note intervals instead of quarter-note intervals, all while being spread out like quarter notes.
</li><li> Quicker pace means the buttons appear more suddenly, the actual speed of the song and notes to hit is not changed. This means you have to react more quickly to new markers appearing, with the slight benefit that less markers appear on-screen at a time, and possibly the timing is a little easier to see visually. Essentially like speed modifiers or hyperspeed in other rhythm games.
</li><li> <em>Ouendan 2</em> actually adds the occasional extra beat for songs in the Very Hard mode, presumably to trip up players who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">assume it'll be identical to the Hard mode based on what they know from the previous games</a>. The fact that these extra notes are so few and far between actually makes them more insidious. However, it does now let you skip cutscenes, something that's appreciated after the twentieth consecutive restart on a Very Hard mode song.
</li><li> If you get enough overall points you can make <em>Ouendan 2</em> even harder by pressing a small icon on the select difficulty screen to get rid of the shrinking circles.
<ul><li> If you want to make all three games even harder you can calibrate your DS so that everything is reversed ('Mirror Mode'). Good luck...
</li></ul></li><li> Also, the whole DS series is casual play compared to difficult beatmaps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Osu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Osu">osu!</a></em>. The official difficulty names are Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane and Expert (though difficulties called "Expert" are uncommon); however, players that make beatmaps are free to name the difficulties of their maps however they want as long as the names make sense: if a difficulty name doesn't seem to have any relationship with difficulty (and instead is named after a player), expect something really hard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> has Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> III</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike">Hard feels like Expert used to</a>, Expert feels like an abomination, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Through the Fire and Flames</a></em> is on a level all its own. There are also cheat codes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">raise the difficulty</a> to utterly terrifying levels. (Like turning off the fretboard entirely, leaving you to play the song from memory. Good luck with that.)
<ul><li> <em>Guitar Hero: Metallica</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a>: Smash Hits</em> added Expert+, a new difficulty exclusive for drums that adds a second bass pedal for songs whose part requires it. Thought YYZ and Beast and the Harlot were tough on Expert? Try to keep up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Neil Peart</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold">The Rev</a> at full speed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> keeps the Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert difficulties. <em>Rock Band 2</em> also lists difficulties for all the instruments on each song from 0 to 5 dots ... or 5 demon heads for the truly brutal songs. <em>Rock Band 3</em> has "Pro" modes which use special controllers and certainly fit the bill, particularly for guitar, bass, and keys.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> has a difficulty named Oni/Challenge. For most songs, this is a difficulty harder than the usual Maniac/Heavy/Expert mode (names varying between versions). Good luck if the song is a boss song, as the Expert chart will be among the hardest Expert charts of all songs in the game, and the Challenge chart will be even harder than that.
<ul><li> DDR clone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove">In the Groove</a></em> does something very similar, with an Expert difficulty above the usual Hard difficulty. The <em>easiest</em> difficulty rating of any Expert chart is 9. They range up to 13, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">even though the scale maxes out at 12</a>. Compare to the hardest DDR boss songs at the time, which were rated no higher than 10 on a comparable scale, though some would have fit as an 11 if they were in ITG.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <em>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em> has Normal mode and Hard mode. And then there's Crazy mode, which has charts that will make even the hardest of DDR charts look like walks in the park with relentless streams of notes as well as notes that make you hit <em>three</em> or even <em>FOUR</em> arrows at once (which require you to use your hands to hit unless you have Xbox-huge feet). What, not good enough for you? For those who like to use two pads at once, there's the Freestyle mode, which is the easier doubles difficulty, and the aptly-named Nightmare mode.
<ul><li> And yes, there is at least one song requiring all five buttons, albeit at the end of a song after a short break in steps so that it won't mess you up unduly. Most dancers drop to hands and feet, using their knee or posterior to hit the center button. Songs with 3-4 arrows are fairly common at high difficulties.
</li><li> Doing fine with the normal mutli-arrow madness? Try any song difficulty marked "Another" for a harder version with stranger steps. Some of these, like Bee, actually have stepcharts on Another meant to be impossible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopnMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopnMusic">Popn Music</a></em> has 5- and 9-button charts for songs. Then there's the "Hyper" difficulty, which is a harder 9-button difficulty. And then there's "EX," which pushes the challenge yet another notch.
<ul><li> Beginning with the 12th installment, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a> IIDX</strong>s difficulties were renamed from "Light 7," "7 Keys," and "Another" to "Normal," "Hyper," and "Another." The idea is that Normal/Light 7 is for casual players, Hyper is for more experienced players, and Another is for even better players.
<ul><li> Most Bemani rookies shouldn't have a problem with Pop 'n Music's 5-key, but I've seen numerous casual IIDX players get absolutely <em>clobbered</em> by Light 7. Many of them literally could not clear <em>anything</em> other than 5.1.1. The fact that all three levels have gone up (considerably) over time, and Konami <em>still</em> needed to make yet another level (Black Another), really tells you the kind of incredible dedication the IIDX fanbase has. Speaking of which...
</li><li> <em>IIDX 15 DJ TROOPERS</em> also added unlockable BLACK ANOTHER charts. you had to clear the song on ANOTHER to get its BLACK ANOTHER chart (if it had one), and you can expect them to be in a field of their own, with one of them having 2626 notes total in just 2 short minutes, equal to 21 notes per second for the whole two minutes.
</li><li> <em>beatmania IIDX 21 SPADA</em> introduces the ✝LEGGENDARIA difficulty, similar to BLACK ANOTHER, available only for the Spada✝leggendaria series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Extra Stage songs</a>. While the ✝LEGGENDARIA charts are a few steps down from BLACK ANOTHER charts, they are still not for the faint of heart; all of the ✝LEGGENDARIA charts are rated 12 (out of 12) and exceed 1900 notes. "Verflucht"'s ✝LEGGENDARIA chart is known for having the most notes of any arcade <em>IIDX</em> chart, at <em>2401</em> notes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Lunatic Rave 2</em>, a simulator of <em>beatmania IIDX</em>, has three well-known ratings scales. The first is the standard 1-12 scale, transplanted straight from <em>IIDX</em>. No surprises here. Playing this trope straight is the "hard" scale, which goes from 1 to 24, with level 1 being considered <em>the equivalent of an 11 or 12 on the standard scale</em>. Above 24 is the "Overjoy" scale, from 0 to 7, and charts on the Overjoy scale...well...the less discussed about them, the better.
</li></ul></li><li> Most songs in <em>O2Jam</em> have Easy, Normal, and Hard charts. You can pay to unlock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">"Super Hard"</a> versions of songs, which are existing songs with new, harder-than-Hard charts. For example, the song "Eleventh Hour" is a manageable level 10 song on Hard, and a nightmarish level 32 song on Super Hard. One particular song, "Electro Fantasy," has an "HD" (no, not high-definition) remix with its own set of notecharts, and it is extremely difficult, even on Easy difficulty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveLiveSchoolIdolFestival">Love Live! School Idol Festival</a></em> had Expert difficulty, originally restricted to limited charts. While some of the expert hits are decently passable, the B-Sides take it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up a notch,</a> to the point where players who use their thumbs rather than index fingers begin to have a severe disadvantage. The version 4.0 update then made the Expert charts permanent and introduced Master difficulty, which demonstrated to players that relatively speaking Expert's difficulty ceiling isn't that high.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls">THE iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls</a> Starlight Stage</em> has Debut, Regular, Pro and Master as its regular difficulties, where the hardest Master songs already surpass SIF Expert. During events, however, the event song receives a special MASTER+ difficulty, which is exactly as you might expect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJMAX">DJMAX</a> Online</em> offers Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties for its songs. Okay. Then there's "MX," which is made hard not only by more difficult charts, but also penalizes you for excess button presses (referred to as FAULTs) and charges you 150 MAX (in-game currency) just to play it; for reference, you get about 10-20 MAX every time you finish a song, so to break even you should only play MX mode once every approximately 7-15 songs. Finally, there's "SC," which stands for "Super Crazy," and its charts live up to the name.
<ul><li> <em>DJMAX Technika</em> has Lite, Popular, and Technical charts. If you're playing on a machine with Platinum Crew enabled, you can also gain access to Special charts, which, most of the time, are even more difficult. Fortunately, Special chart courses in Platinum Crew mode have the normal lifebar, rather than the stricter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX">beatmania IIDX</a></em>-style lifebar of Technical mode. <em>Technika 2</em> goes back to <em>DJMAX</em>'s traditional naming conventions (Normal, Hard, and Maximum).
<ul><li> Of course this isn't exactly lovely; the Platinum Crew lifebar drains twice as fast as the Pop one per hit, making unlocking the extra Technical courses (Challenger, Conqueror, Specialists 1 and 2) not as easy as looks. An example is unlocking the Specialist set, whose mission involves clearing the FINAL SONG on the set in question.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>'<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phase">Phase</a></em> starts with easy, medium and hard levels. By completing marathon mode at higher difficulty levels, you can unlock "expert" and "insane".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaikoNoTatsujin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaikoNoTatsujin">Taiko no Tatsujin</a></em> has Easy, Medium, Hard, and "Oni" or Demon difficulties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a> Booth</em> has Novice (NOV) and Advanced (ADV), followed by Exhaust (EXH).
<ul><li> The sequel, <em>Sound Voltex II -infinite infection-</em>adds the Infinite (INF) difficulty level, available only for new select songs introduced in this game. The third game in the series, <em>Sound Voltex III GRAVITY WARS</em>, adds the Gravity (GRV) difficulty, which is the equivalent of Infinite but for charts introduced in <em>GRAVITY WARS</em>. Likewise, every entry onward has its own new difficulty: Heavenly (HVN) for <em>Sound Voltex IV HEAVENLY HAVEN</em> and Vivid (VVD) for <em>Sound Voltex VIVID WAVE</em>.
</li><li> However, from <em>HEAVENLY HAVEN</em> onwards, some charts have a fourth/fifth difficulty named Maximum (MXM). And it's the hardest difficulty overall, putting previous songs with previous difficulties to shame.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GITADORA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GITADORA">GITADORA</a></em> traditionally has Basic, Advanced, and Extreme. <em>GuitarFreaks &amp; drummania XG</em> introduces the Master difficulty, which is only available on some songs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReflecBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReflecBeat">Reflec Beat</a></em> has Special difficulty, which is above Basic, Medium, and Hard. It is available only on a subset of songs. One song, "STELLAR WIND", subverts this trope, as its Hard chart is rated a 10+ but the Special chart is rated only a 10. <em>Reflec Beat: The Reflesia of Etertnity</em>'s White Hard difficulty is another subversion: it's usually just the Hard chart with <em>Reflesia</em>-exclusive mechanics such as Big Bang Objects and Switch Long Objects added to the chart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrossBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrossBeats">CROSS×BEATS</a></em> and <em>crossbeats REV.</em>:
<ul><li> Both games feature a Hard chart difficulty followed by Master and, in <em>REV.</em> only, Unlimited. Not every <em>REV.</em> song has an Unlimited chart.

Have no trouble avoiding gold as Monk? Your reflexes and rhythm sharp enough to handle Bolt? Can you beat an All Zone Run with every character back-to-back?

To sum it up, you die in one hit, picking up gold kills you, you're stuck using a plain old dagger, and you have to hit every beat <em>at double speed</em>. The character select screen even describes it as "Probably Impossible!". To convey how brutal this challenge is: Out of a playerbase of over half a million players, less than <strong>30</strong> people have verified legitimate Coda All Zones clears.
<ul><li> Also worth mentioning that merely <em>unlocking</em> Coda is in itself an extremely difficult challenge. To do so, you must win an All Characters run. That means beating the game in All Zones with the other nine characters, in a row, without dying or restarting, including the insta-death on gold Monk, the blazingly fast Bolt, and mandatory flawless Aria. The fact that you can play them in any order you want is barely a relief to one of the most grueling, stamina-testing, and mastery-evaluating modes the game includes.

It's not impossible to beat but you'll have to get up to level 50 just to reach a point where every battle <em>isn't</em> a brutal, intense life-or-death struggle. Insanity doesn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumericalHard">make the enemies have more health and do more damage</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">all enemies scale up as your level does</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> gives us the difficulty levels named the same (which are available from the start), but unlike the first game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Shepard</a> has no immediate access to immunities and such (besides a few bonus skills that temporarily increase shields for up to 100%), has to rely solely on their trusty health, shield and cover, and most importantly, has to do so with limited ammo. As the difficulty ramps up, enemies become smarter, faster, more accurate and ALL OF THEM gain damage resistances such as shields (making them perfectly on par with Shepard and the squaddies) and/or an armor layer. Add to this a bonus damage percentage of about 9000%, which means that if out of cover, 3 shots from an assault rifle will drop all of Shepard's shields, and about five shots will outright kill them.

And <em>then</em> the <em>Earth</em> expansion pack added the Platinum difficulty, which ramps up the health and damage of enemies <em>even more</em> as well as adding enemies from other factions. Normally, even on Gold, you wouldn't face the toughest enemies until at least Wave 3, but Platinum spawns these as early as Wave 1. Not just that, but later waves add in enemies from other factions, which means that you will now fight all the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> <strong>at the same time</strong>.

<ul><li> Naturally, to get the <em>real</em> ending you have to go back and beat all the bosses on Hard or Ultimate, though it ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> due to the extreme briefness of the extra scene.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> originally featured two difficulty levels, Easy and Normal. The expansion <em>Persona 3 FES</em> added Hard mode, which took the already difficult Normal Mode and cranked it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to 11</a>. (In addition, the bonus chapter has all the difficulty of Hard Mode, with the added bonuses of denying Social Link and Persona Compendium use.) <em>Persona 3 Portable</em> takes it even further by adding <strong>Maniac</strong> mode, in which enemies hit twice as hard as normal (as opposed to 1.5 times as hard in Hard mode), certain Weapon Fusions are unavailable, and the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> feature is disabled for that cycle, forcing you to start <em>all over again</em>.

Not only is it incredibly hard, but it brings back that otherwise-absent series standard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">instant loss if the protagonist dies</a>. Furthermore, while the other four difficulty levels can be switched between at will, once you pick Risky you're locked into it for the whole game. Playing the Persona 3 story on Risky leaves you with the difficult issue of the protagonist being weak to the instakill Dark spells (which mean that if an enemy uses one on him it <em>will</em> hit and kill him), which are more common here than in any other SMT game. As in, the AI can just choose to make you immediately Game Over against certain enemies and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has a DLC difficulty above "Hard" called "Merciless", which gives enemies even higher stats <em>and</em> turns everyone into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> by adding a 2.5x multiplier to critical damage.

What they don't tell you is that each subsequent play-through of Very Hard is actually harder than the last, all the way up to the 10th time you do so. At Very Hard 10, a level 99 character who was leveled with stat growth items so as to max all their stats at 999 will still take hundreds of damage from attacks in the <em>first area</em> of the game.

And then there's 'Nightmare', which basically has you start out with less than half your normal health, and removes most of the weapons from the game. Yep, that's right - the arsenal that you'd normally accumulate, from stores and pickups, just isn't THERE anymore. Neither is most of those nice boxes of 'Infinite Common Ammo'. And you can't refill non-ammo weapons, such as the Taser, Laser, and Flamethrower attachments until right before the final boss. There's a few places where you can fill up on the basic 9mm ammo, but other than that, every bullet counts. You'll end up fighting your way through the first half of the game (including a boss-fight against a three-story mutant giant with a face-mounted flame-thrower) armed with an LP-08 Luger - and the second half of the game will be fought mostly with a bayonet-equipped assault-rifle, since you have to save all your good ammo for the bosses. And did I mention that the enemies are nearly as tough as they are in Extreme?

<ul><li> The 2.0 patch also adds Dark Mode. It's even harder than Insane but without permanent death and it adds some new item sets which have to be completed or you will take damage over time when they are equipped. It also slightly changes the lighting of the game to be darker.

Base carrying weight is reduced by 100, the XP increase rate is halved, dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation rates are doubled, Stimpaks have weight and most are "expired", making them less effective, among other changes.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, Survival difficulty originally merely made HP recovery and Rad removal much slower, made most normal enemies bullet sponges, and greatly increased the frequency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Legendary enemies</a>. However, the 1.5 update completely overhauls it to include all of the trappings of <em>FNV</em>'s Hardcore mode and then some more, such as diseases that have to be treated with antibiotics or crafted herbal medicines, fatigue, no fast-travel except to the Institute and back out above it, no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyDetectingRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyDetectingRadar">Enemy-Detecting Radar</a> unless you have a Recon scope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">saves restricted to beds</a>, limb damage from being overencumbered, more lethal combat damage to both the player and enemies, and slower enemy and loot respawns.

Not only are enemies' stats increased and yours decreased so that enemies are roughly twice as powerful as the vanilla game, the enemy AI is noticeably improved to use better tactics, other players will invade you more often, you cannot summon friendly players for co-op, and as of the <em>Scholar of the First Sin</em> content release, it makes all enemies spawn indefinitely (in the regular game, defeating an enemy around 15 times will have it stay dead permanently).
</li><li> The multiplayer mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> shipped with three difficulties: Routine, Perilous, and Threatening. A patch eventually added the Nightmare difficulty, which is this...and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">then there's Heartbreaker</a>, which was accidentally made available in the Nightmare patch.
<ul><li> In case Nightmare difficulty just wasn't hard enough for you (enemies have much higher health, resurrecting party members restores only the minimum amount of health to survive), the Trespasser DLC added "Trials", optional difficulty features for the single-player game which the player can toggle on or off. These include giving the enemy AI more and harder-hitting abilities, randomly promoting enemies, making all enemies scale to at least the player's level, and making all health potions heal only 1 health. These even come with the explicit warning that they may occasionally break your game. But for many dedicated players, playing on anything less than Nightmare with at least <em>some</em> Trials suggests a lack of dedication.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nightmare mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> was, infamously, never fully playtested. As the game was developed and released in a hurry, this was never fixed. As a consequence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget">Friendly Fire</a> feature of Nightmare makes it nigh unplayable, as any playable characters who deal area-of-effect damage are liable to wipe your entire party.

If you choose it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, however, you can carry all your levels and equipment, etc., from the first playthrough, which effectively makes it ridiculously easy throughout most of the game right up until around the end when your levels become comparable to those of the enemies again.

Enemy health and attack power is buffed up even more than High Rank, to the point that some enemies' moderately powerful attacks can two-shot you from maximum possible health, even if you have decent defense. Just like High Rank, you spawn in a random spot of the map and supplies are not delivered until far into the mission. Some enemies gain new attacks, and some move and attack faster (<em>double speed</em> Great Jaggi, anyone?). And there's always the chance you could end up running into a really nasty unexpected monster like Savage Deviljho or Apex Rajang on just about every mission. The game expects you to take on these missions with up to four players, and are balanced as such. Good luck soloing them. Accessing these missions often requires defeating an extremely durable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a> that can take a while to defeat even with G-Rank weaponry.

And that's before you get into the actual missions, some of which throw multiples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> <em>at the same time</em>.

While on any other difficulty you're allowed to switch, if you pick Lunatic you're locked into it so that there's no respite. Your characters deal 50% less damage than usual, while enemies deal 50% more. Nothing is carried over from the playthrough before it except for costumes. The one perk is that the shops have all their items immediately available instead of making them available as you advance in the game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy">Epic Battle Fantasy</a></em> and its sequels have the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels">Difficulty Levels</a> of Easy, Normal (the base difficulty), and Hard. And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Epic Mode</a>. Enemies in this mode deal <strong>a lot</strong> more damage than Normal across the entire series and can have bonuses such as starting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buffs</a> and gaining new attacks. This renders use of your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buffs</a> and (in later games) proper resistances imperative!
<ul><li> In the first two games, Epic mode amplifies the offensive stats of enemies by 40%. Then in <em>3</em>, this becomes <em>60%</em>. In <em>4</em> and <em>5</em>, however, these stats are outright <strong>doubled</strong>!
</li><li> <em>EBF 1</em>, <em>4</em>, and <em>5</em> increase enemy HP with the harder difficulties (for Hard and Epic respectively: 20% and 40% like with offensive stats in <em>1</em>, and 22% and 44% in <em>4</em>). All four games reduce enemy HP on Easy as well as their offensive stats.
<ul><li> <em>5</em> also gives some enemies improved AI behavior, though thankfully such enemies' bestiary data states these quirks directly. On a side note, this game also introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">Easier Than Easy</a> mode Zero.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Lords of Xulima</em> is a really prominent example. On the lowest difficulty setting enemies will be very slow and die in 1 hit. On the next lowest enemies are still heavily hamstrung. On the third a few new rules kick in but the game's still fairly easy with some common sense building. The fourth is the same as the third but you cannot save scum. The fifth and hardest starts with the fourth and then buffs it. Massively. Then adds a bunch of optional bosses, some of which are harder than the storyline bosses AFTER the storyline bosses were buffed. And given minions, better skills, AI, regeneration... It is entirely beatable with rock solid tactics and timing, but only two people have done so in as many years. One of them made it, the other used an exploit.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuniIIRevenantKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuniIIRevenantKingdom">Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom</a></em>, the game being too easy was a chief complaint, so much that it even turned some off from buying it. Version 1.03, released on June 22, 2018, added a Hard difficulty level, as well as an Expert one, both which greatly amped up the difficulty, but provided better treasures from both monster drops and certain chests as a reward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalTwilight">Eternal Twilight</a></em> has an interesting example of this due to the developer responding to player opinions. In versions before 1.0.8, the highest difficulty was simply named "Hard" and the other two difficulties were "Easy" and "Normal." After players struggled too much on Normal, the developer renamed the three difficulties to Normal, Hard, and Hell without changing any of their modifiers. What was originally supposed to be considered a standard Hard mode became something higher than that due to a simple name change and reevaluation of what players considered Hard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> has Bringer of Chaos difficulty as well as Custom Difficulty, which you can make harder than Bringer of Chaos. However Bringer of Chaos mode is only one step up from Normal. The main reason why it's here is that originally, the games difficulty wouldn't have a custom setting, just Easy, Normal, Hard and then Bringer of Chaos. Bringer of Chaos completely nerfs chain attacks making them do 75% less damage, and does more than double enemies HP and attack power. In addition to that it also has enemies give off a Rage Strike, which is a buffed up attack right at the start when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnRed">Turn Red</a> that drains your chain attack gauge. It's a massive increase in difficulty to Normal Mode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SacredEarthPromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SacredEarthPromise">Sacred Earth - Promise</a></em>: Hard mode multiplies enemy stats by 1.25 while Nightmare mode multiplies enemy stats by 1.5 on top of giving them additional skills. Considering enemies are fairly strong even on normal difficulty, that 1.5 multiplier is no joke. The description for that difficulty also recommends saving a lot because the player is probably going to die a lot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOuterWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOuterWorlds">The Outer Worlds</a></em>: Supernova difficulty can only be selected during new game, if you change the difficulty down during the game, you cannot change it back up. It entails the following:
<ul><li> Enemies have more health and deal more damage.
</li><li> You must eat, drink and sleep to survive, as measured by hunger, thirst and exhaustion bars unique to this difficulty.
</li><li> Companions will die <em>permanently</em> when downed in battle
</li><li> Crippled body and limb conditions can only be healed by sleeping in beds.
</li><li> You can only sleep inside your ship.
</li><li> You can only fast travel to your ship.
</li><li> You can only manually save inside your ship.
</li><li> There are less autosaves than the other modes.
</li><li> Weapons and armour perform far worse at lower durability.

On Path of the Damned, all encounters have more enemies, enemies have boosted accuracy and defense, and enemies have mode-exclusive abilities. There are also two modes that can be turned on: Expert disables all independent help options, including AoE displays, unrestricted stash access, and detailed quest updates, and Trial of Iron limits you to one save file, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">which is deleted upon death</a>. Activating both on Path of the Damned effectively makes the game Harder than Harder than Hard.

According to the developer, Abstract Nonsense was made to satisfy players who thought her last game's hard mode wasn't hard enough.

One of the options on <em>Gun Nac</em>'s configuration screen is labeled "(No) Ricochet of Bullets", which implements the same "dying shot" behavior from enemies.

Impossible doesn't live up to its name, only being a little tougher than Hard. Suicide comes close to living up to its name, given how fast the enemy shots fly. Lord of Game is so hard you won't be accusing any difficulty below Suicide of being too hard.

However, God Mode is actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty">easier</a></em> than Ultra; suicide bullets, for instance, are far less common, and there's much more (deliberately-implemented) slowdown. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, despite having a much more grandiose presentation than Ultra's, is also easier due to the aforementioned slowdown, and even has a <em>safespot</em> in her last phase.

Then there's a Touhou-style Extra stage, which can only be played on Second Story, a fifth difficulty, which unlike its Touhou counterparts is considerably harder than Hopeless. THEN there's a <em>sixth</em> difficulty, called Chaos Drive, which can only be played in a few specific attacks in Attack Practice mode, and puts both Hopeless and Second Story to shame. <em>Then</em>, all of the above can be played along with Turbo Mode, a special option which makes everything 50% faster.

It's aptly named. The Extra stages also come in three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and the appropriately-named <em>Absurdly</em>.
</li><li> <em>Storm the House 3</em> has very typical difficulty level names (Easy, Normal, Hard) up until the last one: WHY GOD!?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy">Bullet Heaven 2</a></em> has Normal, Hard and Heavenly.

In addition, there's a list of handicaps you can buy and use that can ramp the difficulty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when combined with Heavenly. Suffice to say, this game ranges from accessible to downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, even if not as bad as some of the above examples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueRevolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueRevolver">Blue Revolver</a></em> has Parallel difficulty above Normal and Hyper.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHunterSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHunterSeries">Silent Hunter</a> 4</em> has "Realistic", which many players will actually consider the standard difficulty: any (warfare) simulation game which comes with anything less than an almost completely realistic mode tends to get scolded for it by the hardcore fans of the genre. Unrealistic modes are for people looking for a game instead of a simulation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> series (as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies</a></em>, at least) features difficulty modes Expert and Ace, wherein the 'missile warning' sound (which usually means 'oh crap, evade!') is on so often that it basically becomes white noise. However, Ace mode has its upside too. It's much easier to get an S ranking on all missions on Ace than any other difficulty. Mind you, it's because you <em>have</em> to fly well to even survive.
<ul><li> Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em>, the Ace difficulty tripled the speed with which your plane's kill gauge filled up, allowing for <em>much</em> faster upgrading.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</a></em> has an Extreme and Aces difficulty mode. Extreme is hard enough, where just one missile can kill you. In Aces mode, you can be killed with just 3-4 machine gun rounds and any damage you take cannot be repaired by resupply. Oh yeah, and in everything after hard, the hundreds of missiles being fired at you will basically <em>hunt you down</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter">Trauma Center</a></em> games allow you to choose between Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty settings for most stages. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">post-story X operations</a>, on the other hand, are locked to "Extreme"... and they most definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">live up to the title</a>. <em>Trauma Team</em> goes one further by making "Specialist" mode, stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be equivalent in difficulty to Extreme, available on <em>all missions</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld">Rimworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Extreme is the hardest difficulty setting. Compared to the next-highest difficulty, raids are more frequent (and larger and more heavily-armed), selling prices for goods are lower (and buying prices are higher), crop yields are lower and diseases are more frequent. For additional difficulty, go for Randy Random as your storyteller so you can get the <em>really</em> nasty events like Toxic Fallout from the very start (Cassandra is harder on the late game, as Randy will sometimes give you a break).
</li><li> Sea Ice is the hardest biome to start on. The land is extremely cold, and there is no soil to plant or grow crops or trees - until hydroponics technology is developed, all food and wood must be imported. Animals are practically non-existent, so your colonists will probably have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">resort to cannibalising fallen raiders</a> (or <em>visitors</em>) to survive. The only upsides are that nothing spoils thanks to the chill, and that for a good while anyone that tries raiding your site <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">will probably freeze to death before they've even seen you</a>.
</li><li> Naked Brutality is the hardest starting scenario. You begin with a single colonist who crashlands on the planet with nothing, not even the clothes on their back. They at least start with some technologies like electricity, though.
</li><li> Nothing stops you from combining these to your heart's content if you really want something difficult. Though trying Naked Brutality on a Sea Ice biome is not recommended because you will simply freeze to death before the day is over, making it literally impossible.

Every opponent can floor Little Mac with a single punch.
</li><li> Most EA sports games feature one such mode like this. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em> franchise in particular features the "All Madden" difficulty setting. Not only will the opposing AI suddenly become dangerous competent, but your own players will suddenly become much more incompetent. Try not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> when your franchise QB is intercepted by a defender making a borderline physically impossible grab or when your elite tackling-machine linebacker gets trucked by a 3rd string running back.
<ul><li> EA Sports FIFA has the Legendary difficulty, which is recommended to <em>not touch the difficulty</em>. The AI is 100% precise and it will score goals that you don't even expect to happen. Worse is that the opponent goalkeeper defends like the best of the world even when it's overall is 60. Yours? It will let the ball to enter when it's possible.
</li><li> To top it all off, there's the Ultimate difficulty exclusive to the FIFA Ultimate Team. Yes, they sucessfully made a difficulty harder than Legendary.

<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> has "Easy", "Normal" and "Hard" plus an unlockable "Extreme" setting after clearing any of the default modes once. In Extreme mode, the Soliton Radar is turned off (just like in Hard), enemy soldiers have better hearing and vision and are more aggressive, items don't respawn once they're picked up, Snake has a lower carrying capacity and his health is no longer restored after defeating a boss (with only a few exceptions), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">the torture sessions with Ocelot are even longer</a>. And to put the icing on the cake, every boss gets an additional buff on top of the one Hard already gives them, including Revolver Ocelot running <em>even faster</em>, or the time between Cyborg Ninja's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">Kaizo Trap</a> energy blasts becoming ludicriously short. The torture sessions were made easier in the Japan-exclusive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Integral</a></em> edition, but everything else is just as hard it was in the American and European versions.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em>, the European version added a "European Extreme" setting (also present in the later <em>Substance</em> editions), which was even harder than the standard Extreme setting (achieving this by changing a guard's field of vision so that they can spot the player from <em>any distance away</em>, not just if he's 15-20ft in front of them). There's also an option called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">"Game Over if Discovered"</a> that ends the game if an enemy guard discovers the player's presence. Some consider this a mercy option however, as in most situations if you get found on such difficulty levels you <em>will</em> die, without question.
<ul><li> The 30 or so continues per area is a mere distraction to the real challenge of European Extreme mode: the bosses. A double-shot instant-kill Fortune; then a part where you have to defuse bombs before their timer even began; fighting all 25 of the mass-produced Metal Gear Rays, and finally, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Press X to Not Die</a> sequence that at one point required medical attention to fix a locked thumb.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Press X to Not Die</a> sequence during the finale of the game on European Extreme actually became <em>easier</em> when <em>Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</em> was released, as time limit for the scene was reduced to a third of what it originally was.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em> upped the ante with five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Idiosyncratic Difficulty Levels</a>, the hardest being "The Boss Extreme", which ups the ante more than hard by adding the following: being spotted below 45% camo is almost always an alert; camo levels below 70% attracts attention even over huge distances; attracting attention means guards immediately charge straight towards you; potential allies (e.g. freed militia hostages) are now a massive pushover; and it only takes a few hits to be killed.
<ul><li> The Big Boss emblem takes this even further. Beat the game on The Boss Extreme, with zero alerts, zero kills, zero health/recovery items, no cheat items, and without dying. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">In under 5 hours.</a></em> Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> is an option in the fourth game.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a> 1</em> and 2 have three difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, and Expert, with Thief 3 adding Easy. The harder difficulties reduce Garrett's max health, enforce his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> policy for human opponents (or for certain missions, reduce the number of enemies you're allowed to knock out,) raise the required amount of loot, add more secondary objectives, and avert the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a> trope by forcing the player to make their escape after fulfilling all their other objectives. Among fans, Expert is usually the most popular, as the added objectives and loot requirements ensure a more thorough level exploration experience.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> series is notorious for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">totally misusing the word "Easy"</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Absolution</a></em> includes the new "Purist" difficulty. To summarize; the game gives you zero help, no HUD, no instinct vision<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5jkfo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5jkfo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5jkfo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lets you see through walls, enemy paths and objects of interest; the game is very hard without it.</span>, nigh-omnipotent enemies, low health, high suspicion, no checkpoints, and extra enemies. The game's difficulty select lists off every advantage and disadvantage you get on each level; the Purist level is a list of everything you <em>lose</em>, ending with "Just a crosshair". <em>The difficulty description even warns you that even learning the game by heart will not stop you dying.</em>
</li><li> In another Hitman example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016">HITMAN (2016)</a></em> introduces the <em>Professional</em> difficulty. In Professional, some relatively normal items, such as wrenches, <em>are suspicious,</em> and guards are faster to react. Killing someone in a bloody manner will permanently ruin their disguise, preventing 47 from disguising as them, all Opportunity communication is disabled, combat is even more dangerous than normal, and worst of all, <strong>you can only save exactly once per mission.</strong><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6esyg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6esyg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6esyg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Autosaves are gone too!</span> Oh yeah, deleting evidence of you getting recorded by cameras doesn't even improve your score like it does in Normal mode! At least Professional lets you retain Instinct... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">but you can turn it off in the options menu.</a> Have fun!
</li><li> A variant of 2016's Professional difficulty comes back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2">HITMAN 2 (2018)</a></em>, called Master<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7258q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7258q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7258q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Professional is the equivalent to Normal in this game</span>. Most of Professional's increases in difficulty apply to HITMAN 2 as well, including the only-one-save-per-mission thing, but the game's Mission Story system has been completely disabled.
</li><li> The promised Perfectionist difficulty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a> Blacklist</em> seems to be this as it is a return to classic stealth play, removing melees from the front and Execute ability.
</li><li> A good way to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em> Harder than Hard is to kill one of the Student Council members: even if it's the first week of the game, doing so puts the school atmosphere at a permanently low percentage, meaning everyone's awareness is heightened, and cameras and metal detectors will be installed in the school, meaning there's two more ways Yandere-chan can get caught doing something illegal. (Of course, you'd have to be <em>trying</em> to get this mode, as killing a Student Council member is in itself difficult, thanks to their heightened senses, access to pepper spray, and ability to send Yandere-chan to the guidance counselor.)

<ul><li> So you beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> on Hard Mode? Congratulations. Now beat the <em>ten</em> Extreme mode settings.
<ul><li> This game is notable for having two difficulty mode selections to make. "Action" set how hard the combat was, and "puzzle" set the difficulty of the puzzles. On the highest puzzle difficulty, the FIRST real puzzle in the game requires advanced knowledge of the complete works of Shakespeare to complete, with no context given in-game. It is one of the easier puzzles.

<ul><li> The GameCube remake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">original game</a> starts you off with Hiking and Mountain Climb difficulties, which are renamed Easy and Normal respectively after completion and Hard is added. Beat it again for Real Survivor, where the storage boxes no longer allow the player to deposit items in one location and withdraw them at another, in addition to disabling the auto-aim. Make it through that and the player will get to enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleMonsters">Invisible Enemy</a>, which does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">exactly what you'd expect</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> also has Professional mode, where you're essentially turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> <em>and</em> the resuscitation timer is dropped to three seconds, from about 15. The fact that nearly <em>all</em> the enemies in the game are fast, have projectile weapons, and/or are just generally resilient only makes matters more complicated.
<ul><li> The shortened resuscitation timer actually makes it easier to survive WITHOUT healing items, since any healing spray takes over a second for your character to pull out and use, whereas without any healing items you snap your partner out of it with a good, instantaneous thump on the chest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a> File #2</em> has Nightmare mode, which doubles enemy damage and reduces healing items to three quarters of their usual potency.

<ul><li> Ethan takes more damage from enemies and disables his health regeneration.
</li><li> Enemies are stronger, faster, more durable, notice you almost instantly, appear in greater numbers, and their spawn points have changed.
</li><li> Autosaves are almost completely turned off and manual saving requires finding cassette tapes to use (just like the ink ribbons and typewriters from the earlier games).
</li><li> Item locations have changed, with even less items to find in the field, and more coin cages to unlock, meaning more antique coins to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">frustratingly</a> search for.

Enemies are strong enough to down Leon and Clare in just two hits, certain health items don't restore as much health, the number of additional item pouches you can collect are cut in half, autosaving is disabled, and you have to use ink ribbons to manually save your progress. Additionally, using special weapons and saving more than three times can bring down your score.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake">Resident Evil 3 (Remake)</a></em> tones down Hardcore mode so that it still autosaves and using infinite weaponry won't detract your score. However, it has Nightmare mode and Inferno mode to compensate.
<ul><li> In Nightmare mode, enemies are tougher and more aggressive, enemy and item positions have been reshuffled, and certain enemies that don't appear until late in the game show up much sooner (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Pale Heads</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TentacledTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TentacledTerror">NE-α parasite zombies</a>).
</li><li> Inferno mode takes Nightmare mode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>; enemies are lethal to the point where you're practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, there are less item boxes and typewriters to use, autosaving is disabled, and you get even less resources when crafting.

Ranger Mode Easy certainly makes the game more difficult by removing your crosshair, increasing enemy damage and reducing the amount of ammo you find, but also massively reduces the damage resistance of enemies for more realism. Ranger Mode Hardcore, on the other hand, does everything mentioned above, but further increases enemy damage and removes your entire HUD, so the only way to check the amount of ammo you have is to either equip your journal (which is highly impractical in combat areas) or look at your weapon.
<ul><li> To clarify on the increased enemy damage, ONE - count it - ONE shotgun blast at close range is fatal. Two or three hits from a Nosalis or Howler will kill you or at least shatter your gas mask. A single burst of AK fire is fatal at long range. Ameoba explosions are one-hit kills. Lurkers will swarm you on 'Defence' and 'Child', killing you in just a few hits. Demons will dive-bomb and kill you instantly if you don't take shelter. This mode isn't even remotely fair, and you'll be tearing your hair out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel">'Biomass'</a>. Of course, Biomass does have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">Easy Level Trick</a>
</li><li> Notably, the lack of HUD in Ranger Mode Hardcore is how the game was <em>designed to be played</em>. The HUD was added in after-release patches to the original game when players complained it was too hard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a></em> had its highest difficulty be Nightmare for the first and second game. The player needed to know how most of the ghosts moved and achieve Fatal Frames decently enough, while also managing to balance out their items and especially their film. Then the games got ported to the XBOX and had another difficulty added: <em>Fatal</em>. Most of the stronger ghosts and bosses can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> the player easily, and even weaker ghosts take over a third of the health off with a single hit. Mastering Fatal Frames and keeping a close eye on the health bar are vital to win.

<ul><li> Beating the first game once will unlock the AKUMU difficulty. It follows the same basics as Nightmare difficulty, where uncommon enemies appear way earlier in the game, the resources being even more limited, and your HUD is disabled (meaning you can't tell if an enemy is within range). However, the key difference with this particular mode is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">taking damage from literally</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">anything</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">will kill you instantly</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin2">sequel</a> has Classic Mode. While uncommon enemies don't appear sooner, this difficulty adds to Nightmare mode by preventing you from upgrading your stats or weapons at all, disabling autosaves, and limiting you to 7 manual saves over the entire game.

Notably, the developer Scott Cawthon thought that it was literally impossible to beat and didnt bother programming an achievement for it.

<ul><li> The first game has Normal, Hard and Nightmare. Nightmare makes enemies more stronger, smarter, and better aware of your presence, the noises that Miles makes become louder, and your battery capacity is lowered to just 2 as opposed to 10. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>, <em>Outlast: Whistleblower</em>, adds Insane as an option.

Enemies have 3 times as much health and deal 50% more damage, but if your character is even somewhat decently leveled it's actually not that tough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColdFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColdFear">Cold Fear</a></em> has two difficulty settings. In Normal mode, Tom is fairly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> for a survival horror protagonist.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation">Alien: Isolation</a></em> has Nightmare Mode:
<ul><li> There's no HUD, so you can't see your health bar, flashlight battery, or ammo count.
</li><li> Your map is disabled, making it easier for you to get lost.
</li><li> The motion tracker glitches all the time and will occasionally show an error screen, so you can't tell when hostiles are approaching you.
</li><li> Supplies are much scarcer, making it more difficult to craft anything, and when you do scavenge enough supplies, it's literally a life-or-death decision between making a medkit or a Molotov; plus, you really have to conserve your ammo and your crafted weapons and choose the right moments to use them.
</li><li> The flamethrower itself, the most effective weapon against the Alien, burns through fuel more quickly with one shot.
</li><li> And to top it all off, the enemies are more perceptive.
<ul><li> The paranoid human survivors have better aim.
</li><li> The Working Joes will kill you instantly if they grab you.
</li><li> The Alien itself is much more aggressive and adapts to your strategies quicker. It stays out of the vents for longer periods of time. And the tackle where the Alien just damages you? That's been removed, and now any contact with it is instant death.

Dead On Arrival is exactly the same as Hardboiled with one exception: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">you can only save four times per level</a>. Because most players are used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">saving after every gun fight in a level</a>, it takes a significant change of gameplay to get through.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> had New York Minute Mode, where you had a clock counting down that was never more than one minute long and had to be refilled by reaching certain parts of the level within that time. If the minute ran out, you died. You could get a few extra seconds from killing bad guys, but there were too few bad guys to make a safe run even remotely possible.
<ul><li> New York Minute is far from impossible, and some levels start you out with much more than one minute of time (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequences</a>, for example). The key is to go as fast as possible and kill everything in your way, and don't bother with side-areas that are too far off the main path. You will die many, <em>many</em> times due to some enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">shooting you with 100% accuracy even over long distances</a>, so quicksaving and loading often is absolutely <strong>essential</strong> to reset the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> and proceed. Poorly-timed quicksaves can cause an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> situation though, especially if you are too low on time or save just as a grenade is about to go off.

<ul><li> First off there's Hardcore, which lowers your health to the point that a second of sustained fire will kill you, and is quite stingy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> meter boosts gained from killing enemies.
</li><li> Then there's Old School, which is just like Hardcore, except that Last Man Standing-the ability to come back from death by killing the enemy that killed you-is disabled. And if you're playing on Arcade mode, <em>the cover system is disabled</em>-making survival impossible without either finding something to crouch behind or abusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapAndFire">shoot-dodge</a>.
</li><li> New York Minute returns-in both normal and Hardcore variations. The normal New York Minute is pretty much identical to previous games. Hardcore New York Minute is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, New York Minute with the handicaps of Hardcore Mode. Oh, and if you die in this mode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">you have to start over from the first chapter</a>.

<ul><li> Insane is no pushover. If you even <em>think</em> about taking damage you'll die. This is not helped by the fact that all enemies turn into bullet sponges and they all gain dead eye accuracy. Even Wretches are a two-shot kill. Some sections of the game that you flew through on lower difficulty levels now become controller-hurlingly difficult. And in the sequel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">it gets worse</a>. All the same difficultes from the original remain, but now you have one-shot ticker swarms, bloodmounts and reavers, the Kantus priests can revive any locust not irreparably damaged, and good luck surviving the set pieces and vehicle sections. Some fights as this difficulty can take more than an hour to just make it part a few enemies.
<ul><li> To make it even worse AI teammates bleed out on Insane resulting in a game over if you don't revive them in time; combined with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> of your allies this can be very frustrating as they get downed in exposed places forcing you to break cover and in all likelihood die trying to save them.
</li><li> Insane mode got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">even</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">worse</a></em> in the third game. The past two games put you in a 'down but not out' state if you lost too much health, even on Insane difficulty. The third installment <em>removes this feature altogether,</em> immediately killing you if you lost too much health. And yes, the aforementioned pitiful damage resistance from the last two is retained. At the very least they added Arcade mode, which allowed you to continue on if one of your human teammates bit the dust. Solo gamers are SOL, though.
</li><li> Insane makes the final boss of the third game beyond the impossible in difficulty. Avoiding the instant death attacks and the theron guards trying to flank you simultaneously is easy compared to dealing enough damage to knock the boss off the tower before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she kills Adam</span> which is an instant game over; the fact that the tower has a set amount of health essentially makes this a timed escort mission.
</li><li> It turns out that Insane mode actually does three things. First, it makes it so that the enemies do more damage. Second, it makes it so that the enemies have more health. Thirdly, it cuts your health in half!
</li></ul></li><li> The ammunition you receive from fallen enemies and crates does not increase. Quite literally, if you don't make the majority of all the rounds you fire hit the enemies in the head, then you will run out of ammo.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em> has "Impossible" mode, which would almost be literally impossible if it weren't for the Save Anywhere ability, especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> version with its clunky dual analog controls. Enemies are very fast and good at dodging and hiding, almost never miss, and can kill you in just a few shots.
<ul><li> Several enemies in the later game can see and kill you <em>through solid walls</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Completing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03">P.N.03</a></em> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> with a Professional ranking on all 50 Trials and the overall game unlocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">stripperific</a> Papillon Suit, which makes Vanessa a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. Combined with Hard Mode, this makes the game an exercise in masochism.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm">Alien Swarm</a></em> has Easy, Medium, Hard, and the aptly-named Insane difficulty. Not only are the aliens significantly tougher and more numerous on Insane, the game will also spawn the most difficult-to-manage aliens straight away in the first campaign. To drive the point home, the game already starts out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Parasites</a> in the beginning of the Insane campaign - whereas in Hard they didn't appear until past the halfway mark.
<ul><li> Valve updated Alien Swarm with, among other things, an even harder difficulty, "Brutal". How hard is it? At the time of its release, no one on the Alien Swarm development team had successfully completed a level on Brutal.
</li><li> The difficulty in Brutal lies in its incorporation of the A.I. Director seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a>. Imagine Insane's already tough enemies with all the damage resistance and attacks, and now imagine that they no longer appear from their usual set locations, but wherever the Director feels like and you've got a good gist of why Brutal is so nasty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters">Freedom Fighters</a></em> has the Revolutionary difficulty, in which you have the exact same amount of health as the Soviet soldier enemy Mooks you're fighting (i.e. it only takes 10 assault rifle hits to kill you). The difference is there's only one of you, and hundreds of them. Attempting to Rambo your way through the game is outright suicide, and unless you know how to use cover effectively and make good use of your allied squad, you're not going to get very far at all.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> features the unlockable Hardcore difficulty, in which resources are even more scarce than Zealot mode, enemies are stronger, and when you die you must restart from your last save point instead of checkpoints and you can only save 3 times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3">Dead Space 3</a></em> makes it even worse.

This is amped up to eleven in the remaster with Brutal. Most of the time, enemies kill Nate instantly. Ammo pickups are only a portion of what they normally are. Even people who exploit the "Use tweaks before beating this difficulty" glitch, and give themselves infinite ammo and one-hit kills say that it's still horrifyingly difficult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> has <em>10</em> difficulty settings on a single sliding bar (0.0-9.0), the top three of which fit this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Intensity 9.0</a> is even called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Nothing Harder!</a>

<ul><li> Extreme difficulty in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BloonsTowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BloonsTowerDefense">BTD5</a> is reserved for three of the hardest maps in the game: Main Street, Bloontonium Lab, and Tar Pits. They are unlocked at rank 50, 55, and 60, and cost 25, 50, and 50 monkey money to play, respectively (ranks may be different in the iOS/Android and Steam releases). Note that due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty">Non-Indicative Difficulty</a>, a few Advanced or Expert maps may be considered harder than the first two, but the latter may very well be the hardest in the series!
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Impoppable</a> difficulty in the mobile and Steam releases.

Good luck beating it on the above Extreme-level maps...
</li><li> And then a Halloween update introduced Mastery mode, not a standard difficulty but a <em>mode of play</em> that can be set to <strong>any</strong> difficulty. Bloons are 1 rank up but your bloon-pop income is halved, making farms an absolute necessity for survival. And the "any difficulty" bit includes the <em>already harder-than-hard</em> Impoppable! Again, <em><strong>good luck.</strong></em>

It may not qualify on its own,but it can be <strong>brutal</strong> on a tile rated Hard or harder.

<ul><li> If you can and are willing to face harder tiles early on, it's possible to capture <em>very few</em> Easy Red-bloon tiles until level 10. Once Hardcore Mode is unlocked, you can then capture all the remaining easy tiles in said mode for a hefty bloonstone injection. Be warned that doing this in the second city is harder...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Bloons TD 6</em> has a total of <em><strong>6</strong></em> gamemodes unlocked after beating a map on Hard, divided into 2 paths.
<ul><li> The top path contains the following:
<ul><li> Magic Monkeys Only: You are limited to the ninja, wizard, alchemist, druid, and super monkeys, plus the hero of your choice (Obyn Greenfoot, anyone?).
</li><li> Double HP MOABs: All MOAB-class bloons are doubly strong, so get those anti-MOAB towers ready.
</li><li> Half Cash: Starting cash and income from bloon pops, farming towers, continues, and supply drops is halved. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ll41');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10ll41" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ll41');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It used to be Half Starting Cash, which reduced <em>only</em> the starting amount, but was basically mitigated by Monkey Knowledge.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The bottom path contains 3 modes that get <em>even harder</em>:
<ul><li> Alternate Bloon Rounds: Stronger bloons come at you sooner than normal. This includes round 5 camo, round 10 lead, round 24 <em>camo lead</em>, and fortified MOABs as early as round <em>40</em>.

However, the <em>New Mystery</em> update featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Grand Hero Battle</a> for Legion that introduced a new, even harder difficulty mode: <em>Infernal</em>.

And to make things worse, Legendary Marth's battle introduced an even more insane difficulty called Abyssal. Abyssal gives the enemies Sacred Seals and even crazier statlines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> added "Maddening" difficulty in update 1.0.2 which, in addition to halving experience compared to Hard mode, jacks up all the enemy stats, sometimes to absurd levels, gives enemies more skills to abuse, such as Lancebreaker+ and Pass, even on the first few chapters, and certain bosses now <em>move</em>, leading into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>.

One province, with all the other factions in the area starting stronger than you, and the Mongols rampage in against you around ten turns in, making it a race against the clock to fight your way as far west as possible before 13000 Mongol soldiers come rampaging in off the eastern edge of the map. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2">Total War: Shogun 2</a></em>, however, really sets up a challenge. You no longer get to pause the game and give orders at the same time, the save function is removed, preventing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> in a manner not unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>'s Hardcore mode, you lack your minimap and the enemies are vicious and uncomprimising. On top of this, the AI is hugely improved from previous titles.
<ul><li> Taken even further in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarAttila" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarAttila">Total War: Attila</a></em>, with the 2 Roman Empires. See, the games actually include 2 separate difficulty ratings, one for overall difficulty and one for the difficulty of the specific faction. Until Attila, the hardest faction difficulty was Hard, and had shown up a number of times in Shogun 2 and its expansions, as well as earlier games. In Attila, East Rome is rated Very Hard, and West Rome is rated <em>Legendary</em>, meaning that playing as West Rome with the overall difficulty set at Legendary is considered by the designers to be the hardest Total War has ever been. How hard is it? At turn one you have 7 armies to protect over 70 cities and towns, about a third of which could be attacked in the first 10 turns, another third are at risk of rebellion in the same time frame. You don't have the money to build up your economy and prevent rebellions/invasions at the same time, and because a mini ice age is coming, every few years all your regions become less fertile (all difficulties), meaning less money and food from your farms. To cap it all off, everyone hates you and the Huns, which in game are portrayed as the harbingers of the apocalypse, are actively chasing every barbarian tribe towards you. That is, for the first time in a Total War game, instead of conquering or sacking a town, you can <em>burn it to the ground</em>, and the Huns do this to every town they take, so the survivors of every faction they attack flee directly into your underprotected empire. By about 40 turns in, you'll be at war with a dozen different factions on 4 different fronts. It's a fairly reasonable strategy to simply abandon hard-to-defend areas like the British Isles and the Balkans in order to give yourself a shorter border to cover.

The fifth game's easy, medium and hard difficulty levels each have a similar description (who is it for, what it affects), while the highest, Heroic has this:
<div class="indent">Tell us if you can finish the game playing on this difficulty level - we are not sure whether it is possible.
</div></li><li> "EX-Hard Mode" throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> installments locks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">Dynamic Difficulty</a> at "Hard" for an entire play-through, giving all enemies higher stats and stronger attacks. Meanwhile, unit and weapon upgrades, the purchase of pilot skills, character stat and terrain rating increases are rendered more expensive, though some games may outright <em>forbid</em> any form of upgrades for players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsX">Super Robot Wars X</a></em> introduces the Expert Mode right off the bat and it turns the game into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a> where enemies get more upgrades than players can keep up for the most part.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM</a></em> has Superhuman for its Harder Than Hard setting... unfortunately, the first game had a bug that locked difficulty to Beginner. This resulted to complaints that Superhuman was too easy, so the people making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission-Pack Sequel</a> (who didn't know about the bug) jacked up the difficulty of the game to what Superhuman was supposed to be. End result? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> game known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep">Terror from the Deep</a></em>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em>, for difficulties, has Easy, Normal, and Classic. Above Classic is 'Impossible'. Then there's a togglable option called "Ironman Mode", which disables all but one constantly-updated autosave. This makes it impossible to undo mistakes; every move is for keeps. Ironman Impossible was said to be possible only in theory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">Naturally, people did it</a>.
<ul><li> As if in retribution, the developers released 'Second Wave' difficulty options. Some of these are relatively benign; others make the game a nightmare. The ones listed below are possibly the worst offenders, though there are <em>many</em> more. Starting with some options unlocked by Normal and Classic:
<ul><li> Marathon: all research and build times and costs are multiplied by 3, 2, 2 respectively, among other things.
</li><li> Diminishing Returns: satellite price goes up with every one built.
</li><li> Results Driven: the higher a country's panic level, the less money you get from them.
</li></ul></li><li> Options unlocked <em>by beating Impossible</em>, which are naturally more difficult than the others:
<ul><li> True Loss: all equipment on a killed soldier is lost forever.
</li><li> War Weariness: all monthly funding decreases over time, eventually dropping to zero, leaving mission rewards and the sale of alien items and corpses the only means of income.
</li><li> E-115: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Elerium</a> now has a half-life of 15 days, meaning you lose around 4.5% of it every day on average.
</li></ul></li><li> It is probably <em>literally impossible</em> to beat the game with Ironman mode <strong>and</strong> all of the "Second Wave" options. In fact, you're more likely to <em>win the lottery</em> several times over than make it past the first year this way!
</li></ul></li><li> The almost-official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a> 2</em> patch 1.13 adds an "INSANE" difficulty level. Due to the nature of this patch, however, this simply makes the game more engagine, and not necessarily that difficult. Expect lots of enemies and a little bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>.
<ul><li> If this isn't hard enough for you, there's a configuration option you can set to use the "new aggressive AI". What this does is has the enemy constantly hammer your towns with attacks rather than the normal behaviour of giving you some time to recover. Couple this with the Queen having unlimited forces on insane difficulty, and it's very unlikely you'll ever capture more than the first town.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InvisibleInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InvisibleInc">Invisible, Inc.</a></em> has Expert Plus difficulty, if you've beaten the game on Expert. Expert is described as "the game's default setting"; Plus, meanwhile, is "a bit ridiculous". In addition to harder levels, you won't be able to see enemy lines of sight (a crucial thing to be able to see) if you can't see its source, you start with less power for hacking, and simply knocking out security guards will raise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell">Alarm Tracker.</a>
</li><li> While the Hard Campaign in <em>Black Hole Rising</em> is merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> and the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty">Hard</a>" Campaign in <em>Dual Strike</em> is laughably easy due to it being treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, the Advance Campaign from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars</a></em> is truly a test of willpower and sanity for even the best players. All semblance of balance gets tossed out the window as your enemy's forces are buffed to ridiculous levels while your own army gets neutered into oblivion, and some missions throw in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> where there previously was none just as an additional middle finger to the player. Most missions are only winnable by exploiting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">bad habits of the AI</a>, and even then you'll usually only win by the skin of your teeth - an even <em>slightly</em> more competent AI would likely render the mode flat-out impossible. Merely <em>finishing</em> the Advance Campaign is a Herculean feat, while S-Ranking it is territory reserved exclusively for gods and madmen.

Fun when you can kill the final boss in one hit, not so fun when one miscued attack or failed block means you're dead.

<ul><li> Difficulty settings mostly just affect how much damage the monsters deal and how serious starvation is. Whether you're in Easy, Normal, or Hard, death works the same way: you drop everything you're carrying and immediately respawn at the last bed you slept in or (if the bed has been destroyed or moved) your original starting position. How painful this is depends on how much stuff you had, where you died, etc. It also has "hardcore" mode, though, which locks your world onto the hardest difficulty and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">forces you to delete your world if you die</a></em>. If you're playing Hardcore on multiplayer, the game instead bans you from the server permanently.
</li><li> But without a doubt the greatest difficulty of plain vanilla Minecraft is Ultra Hardcore (UHC). Like the <em>regular</em> hardcore mentioned above, you only get one life to survive. But instead of being able to regenerate health as long as your hunger bar is full enough, the only way to get your health back is by eating golden apples, which are quite expensive and difficult to acquire; or drinking potions, which are very dangerous to obtain, although very renewable once you have them. This is to some degree a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, since you can't select "Ultra Hardcore" as a game mode—you have to pick Hardcore and use a cheat command to disable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a>. Some private servers, such as Mindcrack, hold UHC events where several people are placed randomly on a bordered off world and fight to the death gladiator style.
