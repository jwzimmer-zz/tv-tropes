"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth", as they say.
</p><p>Who the loved one revenge is taken upon often varies depending on the avenger's motivation, so a character avenging a sister will kill a sister and so on. If the method of revenge isn't murder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> may also come into play, possibly with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastVictimShowcase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastVictimShowcase">Past Victim Showcase</a>. Particularly horrific when the target is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">child</a>, but no matter how horrible the crime being avenged (or how non-innocent the victim is), Revenge By Proxy is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">the actual victim is considered only as a means</a> to an ignoble end. Indeed, seeing your loved ones taken away from you, knowing that <em>you yourself</em> caused it, can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.
</p><p>Often, the justification the villain uses for this act — and it's pretty much always a villain or an extremely dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> that does this, due to it being very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>-worthy even if it is in response to another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> as mentioned above — is that he or she wants the person to suffer as the villain has suffered as a result of the act, even if the hero caused it accidentally and the villain deliberately. Indeed, the chief harm that the villain is concerned with is not the harm to the wife, who <em>died</em>, but to the villain himself, who lost her; this underscores the selfish nature of this form of vengeance.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Another common justification is if the hero is protected in some way from the villain or if direct punishment or pain would not be satisfying enough. Killing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> would not accomplish the level of mental anguish required for true vengeance, for example, but killing one of their loved ones while they live on...
</p><p>Even worse villains may regard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship">one of theirs as valuable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">as several of the hero's</a>, and so regard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">killing several victims as mere even retribution</a>.
</p><p>Frequently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewilderingPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewilderingPunishment">Bewildering Punishment</a> for the victim, though this trope is more likely than most to have the villain explain the offense to the victim.
</p><p>In addition to being morally reprehensible, this isn't a particularly practical method of operation, since it runs the serious risk of earning you even more enemies; kidnapping or killing the hero's wife, for example, is a great way to get his otherwise ambivalent in-laws on his side. This in turn is very likely to result in an overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> (by proxy or otherwise). If the villain finds himself confronted by the victim's other loved ones, they'll frequently try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">shift the blame</a>, insisting that the loved ones direct their anger at the hero instead.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the villain feigns this to lure the hero within striking distance. If the villain is feeling particularly sadistic, they won't just torture and kill someone the hero cares about; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">they'll make the hero watch</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes the villain justifies it by claiming that the victim profited by the original crime. Wearing, owning, or using something that belonged to the villain, or one of his own, may provoke it — but don't expect him to inquire about whether the victim knew of the provenance of the item. Or to <em>ask</em> for it. Sometimes the character is aware of the tainted source of his good fortune. He may attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff">Buy Them Off</a>, but if he refuses to give it up, this moves out of the scope of Revenge By Proxy.
</p><p>In some occasions, it may be justified for the heroes to do this toward the villains and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain">their offsprings</a> as long as they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victims</a> who are either fully complicit in the wrong or are doing horrible things in and of themselves. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a> for more details.
</p><p>Quite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a>, both US and Hispanic, have this as part of the plot.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> is full of this trope with respect to gods and humans, though it's much more forgiving of it than modern works.
</p><p>Subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">Sins of Our Fathers</a>. Note that if the actual wrongdoer is unavailable, the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">Sins of Our Fathers</a>; to be Revenge By Proxy, the attacker has to be able to attack the original instead, and choose a different victim.

His revenge ranges from making her work harder, longer and alone compared to others and even going so far as to try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">rape her</a>.

Subverted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bride found out that the suspect was the childhood friend she had a crush on and guessed that he'd attempt something like this, so she <em>could</em> have set the poison aside, yet she didn't.</span>.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a> 21</em>, an Italian billionaire blames the Japanese Medical Board's head for not letting Black Jack operate without a license; he is convinced that Black Jack could've saved his son (and, to be fair, he's probably right). He contacts certain 'associates' ...and the same day, the son of the Medical Board Chairman is gunned down by a mob assassin. The boy survives, but only just barely, with the bullet stopping right next to his heart... and there's only one doctor in the world who could possibly save him. The Surgeon with Hands of God. Black Jack! Cue the Chairman agreeing to release Black Jack, AND pay him an exorbitant fee, for the life-saving operation...

Of the four Sith seen in the movies, two were never Jedi or wronged by a Jedi (that we know of) and of the two Sith who were Jedi, one voluntarily left the Order out of ideological differences, while the other had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">More Than Mind Control</a> worked on him by one of the non-Jedi Sith (though to be fair, Anakin thought the Jedi were holding him back from saving his wife).

One notable example in the films is Anakin's slaughter of the Tusken Raiders that tortured his mother to death, which included the women and children of said tribe that likely had nothing to do with his mother's death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">He didn't care</a>.

Jellicoe has already been captured and is currently rotting away in a federal prison. Span is dead, because sometime after he was forced to resign from his job as CIA director by President Martine Connor, he was shoveling snow off his driveway and died of a heart attack. Orzell points out that Span knew better than to do that, because he had heart surgery a few years ago, and that he had clearly become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>. Orzell asks if they're going to punish him in Span's place, and the Vigilantes say yes.

<ul><li> Hera constantly gets revenge on her philandering husband Zeus by harassing and trying to kill his mistresses and illegitimate offspring. She even punishes women who Zeus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">raped</a></em>, which overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming">Victim Blaming</a>. Considering that he's the King of the Gods and <em>far</em> more powerful than Hera, this is more or less the only revenge she can take; she <em>cannot</em> take revenge directly on Zeus. She did lead a conspiracy of the gods against Zeus and only shifted to indirect methods when that failed.
</li><li> The best known example is probably sending two serpents to kill Zeus's half-human baby son, Heracles. The baby won. Hera continued to torment him, eventually driving him temporarily insane and making him slaughter his wife Megara and their children. His famous Twelve Labors were expiation for this blood-guilt.
</li><li> She forced Leto, a minor goddess pregnant with Zeus's twins, to wander the whole Earth while in labor, looking in vain for a land that would let her rest and give birth, while Hera had made all lands refuse to shelter her. She eventually found one island, Delos (or Ortygia), that dared the goddess's wrath and let her rest. <em>Then</em> Hera prevented the goddess of childbirth, Eileithyia, from visiting Leto, so she went through yet more wretched labor pains, until the other goddesses bribed Hera. Finally, Leto gave birth to the gods Apollo and Artemis.
</li><li> Leto herself isn't above this. She ordered Apollo and Artemis to kill Niobe's fourteen children because Niobe had the audacity to claim to be superior to Leto because she had more children than her.

The wives, unwed daughters and young children of executed criminals are usually only demoted to servants, while married women are considered part of their husbands' families, thus will not be punished for the crime of their own family.
</li></ul></li><li> Specifically prohibited in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. The Avenger of Blood is only permitted to kill the convict. Killing anyone other than the convict, or killing someone for something that was not a capital crime (like manslaughter if the killer was abiding by the terms of their exile) made the Avenger of Blood a murderer, and he was to be put to death.
<ul><li> This prohibition stuck very firmly and spread to the later Abrahamic religions (i.e. Christianity and Islam) and entrenched themselves in the cultures they touched. It wasn't perfect — folks everywhere get into blood feuds and vendettas no matter what religion they are if the laws or the government don't have a strong hold on them — but the principle was accepted in law. Thus you find a derivative codified in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American Constitution</a>, specifically Article III, Section 3's prohibition on "corruption of blood": that is, no punishment or penalty can be placed on a convicted person's family for the convict's crimes.
<ul><li> Which is small comfort in some cases, as the stigma of being related to certain kinds of criminals can actually be <em>worse</em>, and that only prevents the legal system from doing so. More than one criminal's family has been targeted by the families of victims, if not the victims themselves, sometimes with the tacit sanction of local authorities.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, there are several instances in the Bible where an innocent relative is punished instead of the culpable, such as when God killed David's newborn son to punish him for inventing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is (mostly) the modus operandi of many Mexican drug cartels, especially for avoiding possible future revenges against them by the successors. Likewise with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>, especially in Sicily where <em>vendetta</em> is a tradition.
</li><li> Christopher Dorner's manifesto threatened to stalk and murder the children of those he regarded as his persecutors. "I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, Im terminating yours. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and BOR members. Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> did this to those who opposed them many, many times. E.g., since they could not directly attack the <em>very</em> popular Catholic mystic Therese Neumann despite how she openly criticized them, they went after her friends and family instead.
</li><li> Also done by communist regimes. A parent spoke against the government? Sure, now the kids can forget about ever being admitted into a high-school. In fact, they'll be soon taken to the office of the principal who informs them he decided they should become coal miners or factory workers right after graduating elementary school. <br/>The older family members might lose their jobs or be moved out of their homes to a cheaper, smaller flats.
</li><li> This is the basis of North Korea's "Three Generations of Punishment" rule. Not only will your entire family be imprisoned with you, but your children and grandchildren will be as well (providing you live long enough to have any).
</li><li> In Albania, it is a very old tradition that if someone kills a man, his relatives will kill him-or if they can't, any of <em>his</em> male relatives. Though illegal, it still occurs in rural areas, with the male relatives of (alleged) murderers having to go into hiding even now sometimes.
