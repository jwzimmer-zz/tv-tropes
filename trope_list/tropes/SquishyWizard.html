They may be sickly, horribly ill, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple">crippled</a>, or just physically weak and puny; in general, people who have reality-bending powers seem to suffer for it in other areas.
</p><p>There are usually reasons. Powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychics</a> may suffer from this, as they can do anything with their minds — for what do they need their bodies? It may also be the result of a magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a> experiencing the declining health that comes with age.

Since Squishy Wizards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">tend to focus on powerful offensive attack spells ("Nuking")</a>, they are also contrasted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, a form of Squishy Wizard who focuses on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">healing and defensive magic</a> to stand in for their frail defense instead. Squishy Wizards, because of their fragility, are often paired up with fighters in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndSorcerer">Sword and Sorcerer</a> ensemble or part of a full-blown adventuring party.
</p><p>In addition in combination with the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro">Draw Aggro</a>, this was one of the biggest contributors to the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a> party formation as seen in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">MMORPGs</a> — because characters that can nuke the hell out of the opposition and heal allies are usually the squishiest members of the party. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, who can withstand aggro and keep it off the others, was created to keep these squishy party members alive during those big battles.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> applies, the wizards are usually just quadratic in offense, not defense.
</p><p>This trope is distinct from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>, in that the power in question is not necessarily making up for the disability; rather, this trope refers to the lack of physical prowess that tends to accompany mystical powers.
</p><p>In game mechanic terms, the Squishy Wizard is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, being able to dole out big hurt but generally dying if a tough monster looks at it funny. Although Squishy Wizard is sometimes not completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. They can have decent, or even good magical defense, to tank out other wizard (or a monster)'s spell, but a single punch and they're down already.
</p><p>It should be noted that not every wizard is squishy. In fact, one way to reduce squishiness is to simply give them some armor, and there's all kinds of armors. In fact, if say, a mage's magic doesn't work while wearing something like plate armor made from steel, there's the armor known as the Gambeson, which is made from layers of linen, is fairly light, and is good against most types of mundane weapons, acting like Kevlar of the Medieval world and prior. Of course, if even this proves to be too much, then a good wooden shield could do the job. Then there's just plainly enchanting the robes they already wear. Also, since a lot of magic users, depending on the setting, carry staffs that help them to focus their powers, there is almost no reason that they can't use their staff, which are just big sticks, to whack some sense into the heads of would-be attackers, or just plainly knock them senseless.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:
<ul><li> It is explained that mages can infuse their bodies with magical power, converting it into physical strength. However, this requires a great deal of control, and it seems only well-trained mages can do this and even then, the standard mages <em>will</em> get destroyed by purely physical fighters. This is why they usually form pactio with fighters to protect them while they stay in the back line. It was originally presented as a trade-off, in that focusing on self-enhancement and physical training comes at the cost of improving magical versatility and maximum power yield, so that you're safer and more self-reliant, but there's a greater number of things you simply <em>aren't</em> equipped to handle.
</li><li> Negi defeats martial arts masters in a single punch because he uses combat magic, but this prowess only come after he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> and starts seriously training in martial arts like a straight up warrior would. His unwillingness to depend on others has directly led both to his increased dependence on his students for noncombat support and most of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>-related problems.
</li><li> Evangeline notes that beyond a certain level of power, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">artillery mage</a> become indistinguishable due to the sheer amount of power a mage is then capable of channeling. None of the high-level mages in the story have problems with close-ranged combat.
</li><li> The squishiness was why Kotarō initially despised western mages. He started respecting Negi after he proved not-so-squishy.
</li></ul></li><li> Princess Amelia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> is a well-rounded sorceress. She can utilize an effective balance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">White Magic</a> and Shamanistic Magic. However, she's usually the one that gets tossed around the most: there's when the low-ranking demon Seigram nearly kills her with a toss into a cliff wall in the second season of the anime/seventh book, and another demon breaks several bones in her body in the sixth book/fifth anime season. She also doesn't wield a weapon, which puts her at a disadvantage depending on the situation. Surprisingly, Lina, a far more powerful sorceress, is less "squishy."; early in the series she is capable of actually matching an average swordsman, it's just that people who are in her team or people they are fighting are usually either highly skilled mercenaries or very powerful high class demons that are impossible for her level of sword skills or simply immune to physical attacks, but when her magic is sealed during the plot, she continues to show she know more than a thing or two in swordsmanship.
</li><li> Marcille from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is not much of a physical fighter, but let her get to a safe distance to work her magic and watch her mow down monster after monster with her spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lelouch has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Magical Eye</a> and an excellent sense of strategy but is one of the weaker cast members. This is usually played for comedy. In one example, during the school festival in R2, he was outrun by Suzaku, Shirley, Kallen in a walrus mascot suit, and even Milly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">dressed as a dead ringer for Little Bo Peep.</a> During actual combat however, while his strategies can make or break battles, his combat abilities are subpar, and will usually lose in a one-on-one fight.
</li><li> Meanwhile in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a>: Lelouch of the Rebellion</em> manga, Euphie is given this treatment, and shown to be unable to kick a soccer ball more than a few feet. This despite being a member of the Britannian Royal Family, and thus guaranteed to be at least somewhat intelligent and good with plans (she was able to "defeat" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch, as he himself admitted, when it came to the SAZ</span>), as well as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Cornelia's</a> baby sis.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>: Though not strictly a magician but rather a reality warper, Road Kanelot has displayed very few physical feats especially compared to her superhuman Noah brothers. Her most impressive one being probably saltoing from flying umbrella and landing back on it which is a pretty common feat compared to most fighters of the series. However this is hardly an issue since her physical body is not really hers and damaging it is completely useless meaning that in spite of having the most terrifying abilities she is also pretty much invulnerable.... Suoer-power lottery much?
</li><li> In one of the additional OVA-episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em>, the title character meets an ill (cancer, as it seems) girl called Nozomi, who believes in witches and that a witch's magic can only be strong, when her body is weak. Nozomi is discovered by the Ojamajos to be the ideal choice for becoming a witch-apprentice, since she seems already to be able to use magic to certain extent, even without using magic equipment or even a tap. However, Nozomi dies from her disease, before the girls are able to introduce her to the queen.

Instead, the power and spell knowledge came from her Linker Core merging with the original Reinforce's, so it is entirely possible that she simply doesn't <em>have</em> any spells weaker than a tactical nuclear device. Seeing how she rarely gets a chance to practice her even those (each is accompanied by mandatory authorization by TSAB and advance evacuation orders, no kidding), she also needs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyCompanion">Reinforce Zwei</a> to aim them for her. This is odd considering that Rein Eins not only had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> everything thrown at her, but spells like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm">Bloody Dagger</a> show that she can fight effectively at the anti-personnel level.
</li><li> One is free to doubt the canonicity of supplementary games, but <em>The Battle of Aces</em> shows that Hayate can handle herself quite well in melee. Either she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">holding back that much</a> in <em>StrikerS</em> or the game developers saw a need to prevent her from becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena">Magical Battle Arena</a></em>. This is explained by The Battle of Aces being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> to the main Nanoha Universe in which Ein is still alive and is around to teach Hayate how to use magic properly. BOA!Hayate already knows flight control in a few days after the main conflict of A's while Main!Hayate takes months being taught by Nanoha and Fate in the Sound Stage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">BOA!Hayate could likely defeat Unison!Main!Hayate in a fight.</a>
</li><li> Explicitly pointed out in the case of Summoners, like Caro or Corona. The latter of which, in a 1-on-1 tournament, decided to rectify this issue by using her golem-manipulation magic on her own body, allowing her to copy the physical fighting techniques of close-combat mages despite not actually knowing said techniques. This almost works (her opponent is taken by surprise and she gets a few good hits in), but the copied techniques are all very predictable, and her opponent learns to dodge them and still knocks her out.

Though it's shown Robin has greater endurance than most women as seen when she survives a beatdown from Yama in Skypeia, so she's still technically the toughest chick of The Straw Hats.

However physically Nami's only <em>slightly</em> stronger than Usopp and despite some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleStaff">staff skill</a> needs the Monster Trio or Chopper to save her ass when the situation gets dire.

So Nami simply lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">training</a> and therefore is a Squishy Wizard as result.
</li><li> Caesar Clown. Despite (or, perhaps more accurately, <em>because of</em>) his logia abilities, he's downright useless in a fight without them. That's why he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">relies on the fame of his far more powerful benefactors</span>, because he's a weakling by New World standards and he damn well knows it.

</li></ul></li><li> Sugar fit the part too; her powers were incredibly lethal, able to transform and enslave someone with simply a touch, making it hard to get close to her. (Even Robin, as mentioned above, was only able to hold her for a few seconds before succumbing.) Sugar herself, however, was rather fragile; the whole plan to take her out revolved around tricking her into eating a spicy berry and hoping she'd pass out. It didn't work, but <em>scaring</em> her with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake">Wild Take</a> did the job.
</li><li> In a similar vein Basil Hawkins is pretty squishy, despite his powerful DF he outright says to Luffy and Zoro he wouldn't be able to take the pair in a straight fight. However the nature of Hawkin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooDoll">Voodoo Doll</a> power means no matter how hard you hit him, the damage will pass on to one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> leaving him unharmed.

</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, the few cases we see of magic tends to not be directed towards combat.

Levy and Bixlow are both pretty weak if you can get past their magic (and if you have your eyes closed in Bixlow's case). Wendy and Lucy near the beginning were also pretty helpless if their Magic was overcome, though Wendy got by this by training and emulating Natsu's fighting style more and Lucy eventually figured out how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">use her spirits' powers herself</a>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> early on, when some mercenaries mention that most mages neglect to keep their bodies in shape while they study magic.

</li><li> Rundelhaus Cord in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em>. In his early adventures into a dungeon with a group, he attracts too many enemies, and fails to let the tank gain aggro to focus the monsters on him instead of the former, forcing them to run away repeatedly. It's only after Minori put her foot down and they all discussed their abilities with each other that they finally start working as a team and manage to finish the dungeon.

Yes, stands are powerful, come in many flavors and a representation of a persons fighting spirit.

Pretty much every magician can hold their own against physical fighters as well because borg, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shield</a> that can only be broken by magic or metal vessels, is perhaps the most basic spell available.

While her magic spells make her even more effective in some situations than <em>Guts</em>, said spells generally take a lot of time to cast and while she's casting them she's completely helpless. And without her magic she's just a twelve-year-old girl with a staff, not at all suited for physical combat.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">Power Level</a> even lists his "Strength" stat as 0.

Relatively frail means being mildly hurt by a boulder to the face so he's still far tougher than a normal human, it's just that the main cast could take a hit like that without batting an eye.
</li><li> Kurumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em> has powerful, magical powers, but in comparison to the other spirits she is not particularly strong, fast or resistant.
</li><li> Wizard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em> is a talented young witch who can fire powerful fireballs with her staff. However, it is completely defenseless in close combat. This is fatal to her when she is attacked by numerous goblins in a cave. After her wand is broken, she is completely helpless.
<ul><li> Priestess also qualifies for this. While her goddess grants her some miracles that she can use for combat, she has no chance in a real close combat. That makes her a case of <em>Squishy Priestess</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Downplayed. Todoroki is by no means weak or un-athletic, in fact he's on the upper end of his class in terms of speed and strength. He just relies on the devastating long-ranged power of his Quirk so much that he falls into the danger of overspecializing, which is why Aizawa faces off against him during his exam, so as to negate his Quirk and force him to not rely on it temporarily.
</li><li> Aoyamas lasers are very powerful, but he's got no endurance. During their fight in the U.A. Sports Festival Arc, Ashido takes him down with a single punch once she evades his lasers and gets close to him.
</li><li> Yaoyorozu can create just about any kind of object she wishes, but depending on the object, it takes time to make them. So she needs others to hold off the enemy while she creates the materials she needs. While her creations can do a lot of damage (like when she makes an entire cannon) and is possibly the most versatile Quirk of any character, in terms of direct physical prowess she's as normal as anyone else, as demonstrated in her fight with Kendo.
</li><li> Aizawa notes that Midoriya is simply more physically fit than Shinso, so once Midoriya manages to break his mind control and the two enter a Quirkless grappling match he overpowers him with relative ease. He seems to have acknowledged this and is actively working on it; he's noted to be bulkier in muscle when he reappears after the U.A. Sports Festival Arc, but still not fast or athletic as the students in the Hero Course.

</li><li> Marvel's first Star Thief represents the extreme end of this. He's permanently paralyzed and insensate, none of his five senses work. Due to this, however, he gained the ability to use his dormant psychic powers to the full. First he learned to sense through other people; then, he gained the power to <em>vanish stars</em>.
</li><li> The heavily manga-influenced indie comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDemonMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDemonMages">The Demon Mages</a></em> stretches this trope to its literal extremes with sorceress/scientist Countessa Tesryon, a succubus (closer to an energy-vampire in this series) whose insides are described as being gel — like that of a spider.

He <em>is</em> capable of silently casting big spells, but it almost always happens when under duress and tends to have unpredictable results such as accidentally putting everyone in Times Square into temporary magical comas. He's gotten better at using his powers properly without outright needing to speak, but ultimately he's still physically an ordinary teenager with no extra durability.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> places Jedi Consulars (and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Shadow Archetype</a> — Sith Sorcerers) as this, but only by comparison. Consulars are primarily diplomats and healers, relying on their diplomacy training to prevent a fight, and heavy usage of Force powers instead of lightsaber combat if diplomacy fails. As a result, Consulars usually fall back on the simpler or defensive styles of lightsaber combat (Form 1, Form 3) and are vulnerable to the styles that require physical strength. Sith Sorcerers are often physically corrupted or weakened by their use of Dark Side experiments, but unleash insane amounts of power at anything that threatens them...or just mildly annoys them.

<ul><li> Grey Star, the protagonist of the 4-book spin-off <em>World of Lone Wolf</em>, exemplifies this, especially compared to the extremely badass Psychic Knight of the main series. Although Grey Star gets the same basic stat rolls as Lone Wolf, he receives none of the healing powers, combat-enhancing disciplines, or special items, and is heavily penalized if he ever has to fight bare-handed or with a weapon other than his magic staff. Sure, he can use his magic to multiply the damage inflicted by the staff — but this cost precious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Willpower points</a> that are put to much better use casting spells. The best strategy to win those gamebooks is certainly to avoid combats like the plague — and in fact, Books 2, 3 and 4 can all be finished without any fights if you're lucky (not so much with Book 1, though).
</li><li> Banedon too, in the <em>Magnamund Companion</em> adventure featuring him. He's a bit more adept with weapons than Grey Star, but the few opponents he can fight hand-to-hand are tough, even with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> spell "Vigour".

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog">Hurog</a></em> series, most people who are professional wizards <em>are</em> squishy. Justified because it's mostly a desk job. On the other hand, the protagonist, Ward, has some magical skill of his own and he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> and not at all frail. Then there is Oreg, who is a powerful mage, but also a kind-of ghost, and has the body of a 17-year old boy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and can shapechange into a dragon after he is freed. Not squishy</span>.
</li><li> While most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>'s mages are skilled in combat as well as weaponry, in the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Protector of the Small</a></em> book, the villain Blaise relies on his seven foot bodyguard for protection.
</li><li> Raistlin from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>-derived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> Saga</em>, who traded his health for magical power, resulting in a chronic, racking cough. Another mage is introduced who was also forced to sacrifice his great athletic prowess for his magic. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">rule</a> for Dragonlance wizards: they're basically a religious order, and their gods forbid them from doing any more weapons training than is necessary for self-defense, so they can better concentrate on their magic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMule">The Mule</a>": The Mule, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">mutant</a> gifted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, is described as a physical giant by the poor weakling Magnifico. Other characters assume there's some exaggeration at play, as Magnifico is spindly and barely able to hold up his own body. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's a complete fabrication, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoAliasesOneCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoAliasesOneCharacter">Magnifico is the Mule</a></span>.
</li><li> Wizards in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels tend to be unhealthy in a different way: most of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eaters</a> (a "light snack" at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Unseen University</a> can run to several courses) and unlike many examples of that trope they <em>do</em> become hugely overweight. Exceptions include the Mustrum Ridcully, the current Archchancellor (an enthusiastic hunter, angler and martial artist, and a firm believer in healthy exercise, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> who once went two rounds bare knuckle boxing with Detritus, a troll considered badass by troll standards), Rincewind and the Bursar (both of whom fit the "frail and emaciated" version of the trope, although Rincewind is capable of a fair turn of speed, perhaps making up for his total lack of magical ability), and the Librarian (who will squish <em>you</em> if you get on his bad side). Ponder Stibbons, meanwhile, went from plump to skinny, and has a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysiques" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysiques">Geek Physique</a>, meaning that he's a different kind of squishy.
<ul><li> Vividly demonstrated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLightFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLightFantastic">The Light Fantastic</a></em>: Trymon, the novel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is possessed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Things from the Dungeon Dimension</a>, has read the most powerful book of magic around and is a pretty potent wizard in his own right. He is beaten up in hand-to-hand combat by Rincewind!
</li><li> The trope is mostly averted overall though, indeed, before Ridcully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">the major method of advancement in the University was killing a wizard of a higher grade with non-magical means,</a> leading to a tendency amongst wizards to be quite tough — while they were still quite large, for the most part, they tended to be sharp as a tack. Squishiness is preferred, since everyone remembers on some level what happened the last time(s) wizards decided that they preferred power to the buffet table. Grass didn't grow in certain places, and if it did, it grew in some very disturbing shapes and forms.
</li><li> However, it is also noted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>, that despite the fact that the Wizards (Ridcully excepted) seem to be large, fluffy and harmless creatures quite divorced from reality, they can quite easily force their way through a large crowd of borderline football hooligans at a street football match.
</li><li> Averted with the witches, who rarely use magic — they live just the same life as everyone else, which in the places where witches tend to live is a very hard life with lots of physical work.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLightbringerSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLightbringerSeries">The Lightbringer Series</a></em>. The setting's magic, called drafting, mostly summons inert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> called Luxin. In order to actually <em>use</em> Luxin, physical activity is usually required, doing things like hauling on oars and manually pumping reeds. Further subverted in that the narrative focuses on the Blackguard, elite warrior-drafters who are in peak physical form for reasons unrelated to drafting.
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em> books: maintaining your skills as a magic-user is a full-time job. Maintaining your skills as a fighter is a full-time job. Yes, there are people who do both, but they do so by giving up any pretense to having a life outside their skills, and usually giving up on getting a good night's sleep as well. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> off and on in later books, especially <em>By the Sword</em> — Mercenary Captain Kerowyn has to explain to magic-wary Valdemarans that magic is not all powerful and that mages go splat just as easily as anyone else; perhaps more. On the other hand, while few mages learn professional-level fighting skills, quite a few of them still maintain high degrees of physical fitness. Then again, the fact that in the Valdemar books manipulating high amounts of mana is work equivalent to heavy manual labor helps explain why there are so few fat, out-of-shape wizards. Of the various magic-using protagonists in the series, Kethry of the ''Vows and Honor' trilogy is the best example of a Squishy Wizard — and even she gets around it most of the time thanks to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a> that can take control of her body to confer upon her the skills of a master swordsman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Voldemort is described as being very tall, thin, and bony, with chalk-white skin and spidery hands.
</li><li> Harry could use a little meat on his bones too in the book, having been described as rather thin, though this is due to being rather underfed being raised by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a> aunt and uncle. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, he's revealed to be quite athletic-looking once he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">takes off his clothes,</a> though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a> could also be at play. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, he starts shooting up and getting more lean than skinny. Justified in that after living at Hogwarts he's properly fed healthy full meals and gets involved with sports (Quidditch), which (particularly when combined with puberty) would lead to a more muscular figure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, Neville is mocked by a whole group of Death Eaters for his pathetic skills with magic. A second later and he proceeds to tackle one of them to the ground and display the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableUseOfAWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableUseOfAWeapon">"other"</a> use of a wand by stabbing it into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Death Eater's eye</a>. The others seem somewhat shocked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">such unorthodox tactics</a>, giving Harry a chance to act.
</li><li> Also, despite otherwise being heavily based on real British boarding schools (though severely understating the inter-student violence), Hogwarts is notably lacking any sort of PE program, where real British boarding schools tend to be enthusiastic participants in relentlessly physical sports like Tennis, Athletics, Football (soccer) and, of course, Rugby Union — indeed, in the latter case, private school alumni usually make up at least half the England rugby team, even though they consist of only 7% of England's students — with multiple teams per year group and per sport, and compete fiercely with each other on a weekly basis in term time. Hogwarts, by contrasts, has one sports team per house, (a sport in which most of the movement is done by magical broomstick), which plays one match against the other three houses a year, and nothing else. Though admittedly, depending on the teacher their classes (especially Care of Magical Creatures) may be a bit more physically demanding than the average Muggle classroom. And having to run up and down the stairs in a huge castle to get anywhere — often taking the long way round to avoid moving stairs and Peeves — does help.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToRidePegasus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToRidePegasus">To Ride Pegasus</a></em> series, Peter Reidinger is the world's most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic</a> Talent, with a totally paralyzed body. It's only because he <em>is</em> paralyzed, in fact, that he was able to discover his powers by telepathically calling for aid.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em> trilogy, Otha, the Emperor of Zemoch, is an immortal graced with unimaginable magic powers by his god. He's also lazy and stupid, and over the millennia of his existence has morphed into something that is described as being roughly analogous to Jabba the Hutt in appearance. He can't even walk; he has to be carried around on a litter by slaves.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">Polgara the Sorceress</a></em>, Polgara notes that despite his elderly looks Belgarath will as readily resort to bar brawling tactics as to magic. Not to mention Beldin who casually tosses people twice his size around. Or Garion, who tends to prefer his BFS to magic. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">Empowered Badass Normal</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Durnik, who was a blacksmith before dying and coming back as a sorcerer</span>. David Eddings likes averting this trope. In <em>The Mallorean</em> it is revealed that Belgarath is only cosmetically elderly, since (as had previously only been implied) sorcerers could both consciously and subconsciously alter their human form to fit their desires as well as shapeshifting to animals.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Riders in general subvert this. They are generally both capable in combat and some of the best magic users around. Having a Dragon watching your back tends to help in both regards, of course.
</li><li> Oromis is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <strong>the</strong> Cripple who is Whole. He can't use large amounts of magic and he has seizures from time to time. This (especially the latter) contributed to his death in <em>Brisingr</em></span>.
</li><li> The High Priest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">(Priestess?)</a> of Helgrind gave up all of its limbs (and part of its tongue) in ritual self-mutilation. It also possesses incredible psychic powers which it uses in a mental battle with Eragon, Arya, Angela, and Solembum. Oh, and it battles these super-powerful magicians <em>all at the same time.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBrunner">John Brunner</a>'s <em>Telepathist</em> introduces Howson, whose telepathic power is second-to-none. Yet he is afflicted with haemophilia, scoliosis and never went through puberty, because the region of the brain that controls the growth of the body was overwhelmed by the area that governs telepathic ability.
</li><li> Most medicine cats from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>. Though they are trained in self-defense they have nowhere near as much combat training as warriors. There is one exception: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Yellowfang was a warrior before becoming a medicine cat and was pretty badass.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wizards are no more squishy than normal humans. In fact, their magical abilities grant them the ability to recover from nearly any injury given enough time (although "enough time" may be years), meaning they have much less to worry about in terms of chronic pains or lasting injuries over their centuries long lifespans. The vast majority of Wardens (Wizard soldiers/police) seem to be in pretty good shape. However, wizards are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">still human</a> and when compared to vampires, demons, ogres, trolls, things that <em>hunt</em> trolls and other super-strong monstrosities, they are subject to this trope.
</li><li> Harry himself has dismissed direct physical enhancement as an impractical use of magic given the number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">required secondary alterations</a>. Although with the help of powerful outside forces Denarian transformations and the Winter Knight Mantel demonstrate it is possible. It's possible having worked out those problems means giving up some claim to be human, and the White Council seems very reluctant to think of a nonhuman as a "wizard", making the term self-enforcing. At one point, Harry goes on a rant lampshading this trope during an alley duel. His enemy turns out to be an exception. Oops.
</li><li> Personally, Harry does his best to defy this trope. He runs regularly, trains aikido (it's his best friend's preferred style, and has techniques for staff fighting, which are useful when you habitually carry one already) and generally carries a handgun too. It also helps when he (somewhat regularly) get's into fights with other humans for one reason or another and doesn't want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawsOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawsOfMagic">use magic to kill</a> or hurt them. On one occasion, he uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">blast of fiery destruction</a> to distract a monster, then runs up and just <em>punches it in the face</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Harry:</strong> Man, the yahoos I scrap with never seem to anticipate that tactic.
</div></li><li> There's at least one wizard who has the ability to act as a close-quarters bruiser: Listens-To-Winds, whose specialty is in effortlessly deflecting enemy magic and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">beat the shit out of enemies as a bear the size of a minibus</a>. He seems to prefer acting as a Medic to fighting, however.

In another world Mel'in, the physical weakness of most wizards allowed the young Emperor to successfully wage war against wizards. Nevertheless the same series there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Battle Mages</a>, who are both super strong wizards and good fighters.
</li><li> All wizards in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede">Patricia C. Wrede</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em>.

</li><li> Justified <em>for humans</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em> series, where Aahz observes that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">judging by Skeeve's learning curve</a>, human lifespans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">aren't long enough</a> to master both combat and spells. Nonhumans like Aahz and Tananda have longer to practice and can thus become both magically competent and non-Squishy. Humans are also one of the physically less formidable races to begin with; Skeeve's bodyguards Guido and Nunzio are terrifyingly powerful fighters by human standards, but pretty much every nonhuman in Skeeve's crew (except maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Vic</a>) could crush them without breaking a sweat.

</li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Qirsi</a> from <em>The Winds of the Forelands</em> are short-lived and frail owing to the rigors of their magic.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> series, in that strength of magic makes a wizard harder to kill. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> level wizards cannot only survive but <em>function</em> while suffering from wounds that even the most advanced life support systems would be unable to cope with, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having your head cut off</span>. In <em>Dreams of Steel,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Soulcatcher</span> dismembers, burns, and scatters the ashes of a defeated rival wizard, treating it as unremarkable standard procedure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JasonCosmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JasonCosmo">Jason Cosmo</a></em> and its sequel, mages supposedly have fast recuperative abilities and enhanced stamina (apparently the result of magical energy constantly pouring into the body), but we virtually never see any evidence of this, with the exception of the Lancer of the story, arcane master Mercury Boltblaster. Mercury has the excuse of spending much of his life travelling to obtain the finest education in the world in martial arts and swordsmanship, to avoid having to depend on spellcraft. As he spends much of the books either unable to cast spells or unable to do so without calling hostile and (ludicrously) overwhelming force to his exact location, this turns out to have been an excellent use of his time.

<ul><li> The Wizard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">Character Class</a> always has the smallest Hit Die (often a four-sided die), determining their number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>. They also start with no armor as well as the poorest attack bonus available. In 3rd Edition, wearing armor inflicts a percentile Arcane Spell Failure chance that goes up as you get heavier armor — and in the earlier editions, wizards (who were called Magic-Users in the earlier editions and Mages in 2nd Edition) could wear <em>no armor at all, ever</em>, having to rely on magical items like Rings and Cloaks of Protection and Bracers of Defense to raise their AC. This cuts down on mage survivability at lower levels, especially since the AC system that <em>D&amp;D</em> uses determines how hard you are to <em>hit</em> rather than damage, and Wizards get precious few spells at first level on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian Magic</a> system.
</li><li> <em>The Rules Cyclopedia</em>, the definitive resource for Basic <em>D&amp;D</em>, tells you straight out on page 19 where the Magic-User class is introduced about how a mage should not adventure alone and that his survivability is rather low without others to protect him. It also has Elf as a class that can use all armor but can only use up to fifth-level magic at their highest level (10th) unlike the mage who can get up to level 36 with up to ninth-level magic.
</li><li> Jinx of Jinx.com wrote a <em>D&amp;D</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong">Filk Song</a> called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYMYakprTWg">"Always the First to Die"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about the Squishy Wizard problem.
</li><li> 3rd Edition's <em>Psionics Handbook</em> had aversions by way of some Psion subclasses, there was one for each statistic, including Constitution. They were later nerfed in 3.5 edition to uniform squishiness for balance.
</li><li> This has changed a little in 4th Edition. Controller classes (of which the only one in the first book is the Wizard) get the lowest number of starting Hit Points, the lowest rate of HP gain per level, the fewest number of healing surges, and are only proficient with the worst armor in the game. While it is <em>possible</em> to overcome these deficiencies with feats, it takes a lot of investment that could be spent elsewhere. Of course, they are also the only class that has a number of Area of Effect abilities. You can add your Dexterity bonus OR your Intelligence bonus to your AC when wearing no armor or light armor. Guess what's the wizard's primary ability score. Plus, wizards get numerous defensive and evasive spells. Overall they're not nearly as squishy as rogues.
</li><li> 5E improves things for wizards a bit by upping their hit die from d4 to d6... which is still the lowest among the classes, plus it has few protective options at low levels and no armour proficiency. This is also the edition that introduces the concentration mechanic, an attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfing</a> buff spells, by only allowing one active concentration spell at a time, and in the case for the party's wizards, this spell is probably going to be Haste on the fighter.
</li><li> Class features aside, magic-using classes use mental stats to cast spells (Wizards have intelligence, Clerics have wisdom, and Sorcerers have Charisma, for example), so any wizard/sorcerer/warlock/whatever is going to want to keep these stats high, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">at the expense</a> of physical stats, which their class doesn't make use of. That being said, a number of non-martial spellcasters tend to make Dexterity their third-best stat, so that they are, at the very least, quick enough to dodge attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> Mages in all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a></em> games are by far its most powerful and versatile supernatural creatures in general — but since they're physically human, they're still Squishy Wizards compared to vampires, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Prometheans</a>, werewolves, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">demons</a>, and need time to set up their more impressive feats, not to mention the risk of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Paradox backlash</a> if any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> see them working "magick."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> plays this straight by most races' psykers, with the exception of some being real hardcases, such as Tyranid Hive Tyrants (but not Zoanthropes), Space Marine Librarians, Grey Knights and Chaos Daemons. Eldar Farseers are actually tougher than most other Eldar, due to slowly turning into crystal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wizards (apart from an extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">wound</a> or two) are barely more resilient than an average foot soldier. Then there's the Slann: although they can't fight in combat, they are near as dammit impossible to kill, having the second-highest number of wounds in the entire game, are always surrounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Temple Guard</a> to protect against physical attack, and have big shiny magic shields to protect against ranged. Also avoided by Vampires; already more than equal in combat to the Lords of any race except Chaos, you can then trick them out and make them the equal of almost any magic Lord. Speaking of Chaos, their wizards also have a tendency of being a lot harder than they have any right to be; mortal Chaos Sorcerers are the only wizards in the game that can wear armour. For the complete antithesis of Squishy Wizard, nothing beats sticking a couple of magic levels on a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Greater Daemon</a>.
</li><li> Vampires aren't dedicated wizards, the magic using lords of most factions start at level 3 and can be upgraded to level 4, Vampire Lords start at level 2 and can only be upgraded to level 3, so they might be better described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knights</a> than wizards. Similar deal with Archeon in the Chaos army, who is in addition to being arguably the strongest fighting model in the game (currently), is also a level 2 wizard.
</li><li> Ogre Butchers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook">Smash Mooks</a> that practice a form of magic known as Gut Magic. And due to a quirk in the rules (which is acknowledged by the design team as technically legal, but not intended) they can also wear magical armor. Note that the basic Ogre Butcher has a statline the same as most enemy generals, allowing them to more than hold their own in a scrap.
</li><li> Then there is the High Elf mage Teclis, who is the extreme of this trope. Aside from having 3 wounds (which is meh by lord standards), he has the worst defensive stats in his army, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> to begin with... and the best magic rules in the game. According to the fluff, Teclis' body is so weak he needs a regular diet of healing potions just to stay alive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anyone can purchase the Magery advantage and Spell skills quite freely; however, unless you have a lot of character points to build with, it's difficult to build a character who is both a powerful spellcaster and a mighty warrior.
</li><li> 3rd edition has a sort of built-in aversion; casting magic costs Fatigue, and Fatigue is a substat of Strength, so mages want to have a decent Strength.
</li><li> 4th edition bases Fatigue on Health instead; Strength now determines Hit Points. And Fatigue can now be raised independently of Health, so a Wizard can use Strength <em>and</em> Health as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stats</a>, freeing up points for magic spells and the like, at the cost of making himself squishier.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> is mostly in the same boat as <em>GURPS</em>.
<ul><li> Anyone can pile on armor and anyone can be good at dodging and have a high Body stat, but Mages have to spread their points thinner, though, because they have magic to spend them on. And non-mages can afford to pile on cyberware and bioware that can give substantial defensive bonuses.
</li><li> Wizards maintain a high casualty rate in <em>Shadowrun</em> due to a simple aphorism: "Geek the mage first." The cheapest heavy-damage abilities are magical, as are the <em>only</em> rapid healing abilities. Thus, the one throwing fireballs and healing spells gets the first clip emptied into him.
</li><li> Drain; a few too many spells combined with poor rolls on Drain Resistance, and the mage ends up knocking <em>himself</em> out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheFantasyTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheFantasyTrip">The Fantasy Trip</a></em> plays this pretty straight. Wizards have to pay twice as many memory slots to learn non-magic skills (like how to swing a sword), and get penalized for wearing armor or carrying weapons (handwaved in-game by claiming that ferrous metals interfere with magic.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye">The Dark Eye</a></em>, all magic users have trouble with heavy armour, since iron interferes with magic. Druids have a religious taboo against smelted metal, so they can't even use a regular knife (do get skill points for flintknapping, though). Wizards specifically are forbidden by law to wield weapons bigger than a dagger, or wear armour heavier than a gambeson.
</li><li> Spellcasters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ScarredLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ScarredLands">Scarred Lands</a></em> can't wear armor, because spellcasting causes the caster's body to produce a large quantity of heat. In fact, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">can't wear much at all</a>. (Explains a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover">book covers</a>, doesn't it?)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> mostly averts it, as anyone can learn Sorcery under the right circumstances, and there's nothing preventing a sorcerer from learning Resistance Charms. The Twilight Caste of the Solars were originally <em>all</em> about averting this, as when their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Anima Banner</a> flared, they could reflexively "harden" it to avoid taking damage. After the 2.5 Errata, the concerns about being one-hit-killed while prepping to cast a spell were reduced, so the Twilights were given magical senses instead; that said, the Resistance charm notes above still apply.
</li><li> Taken to extremes with <a class="urllink" href="http://theferrett.livejournal.com/2004/01/04/">Flapjack, the Mage With One Hit Point<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Magic-users in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> can end up falling into this trap somewhat easily because (a) they need to spend a chunk of refresh on their powerset, leaving little to nothing for more "mundane" human-level stunts and (b) the system sharply constrains how many "top-level" and second-tier skills any given character can have and being competent at magic practically requires being good in three <em>specific</em> skills — Conviction, Discipline, and Lore — that, while not without their mundane uses (Conviction in particular sets the length of a character's <em>mental</em> stress track), aren't exactly very applicable to combat. Going the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> route is possible to an extent, that character is just apt to end up average at best (and possibly subpar) at anything that's <em>not</em> magic or fighting, which as in any modern setting is its own potential handicap in the Dresdenverse.
</li><li> The various "magical" creature types in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, such as wizards and shamans, tend to have lower power and toughness (on average) when compared to more smash-mouth creature types, such as beasts and warriors. As such, they tend to have more varied and useful <em>abilities</em>, taking the role of support or utility creatures. The new Planeswalker cards, introduced later, undermine this by making some fairly (if variably) tough characters who are, essentially, powerful wizards. One case of this appears in abilities with Gideon Jura, who as an ability that doesn't affect his loyalty that turns him into an indestructible 6/6 human soldier.
</li><li> Sorcerers or equivalent (convocators, etc.) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy">Anima: Beyond Fantasy</a></em> aren't exempt of this, even with the large possibilities of customizing them the game offers. Lowest life points per level and high costs of the abilities to attack, parry, and use armor, even if it does not interfere with their ability to cast spells or invoke creatures, say it all.
<ul><li> Averted by casters specializing in Creation magic, especially ones that also take the Arcane Warfare metamagic tree branch. Creation magic offers a lot of long-duration buffing spells that include things like increased maximum health, increased resistances (both status and elemental), accelerated regeneration, shielding (so they can use their magic-aiming ability to parry things), and a "you must be this damaging to hurt me" barrier against things not capable of cutting energy, as well as offering direct healing spells. The Arcane Warfare metamagic branch cranks up the shielding aspect in particular, making the shields able to absorb much more damage and have a better effective parrying ability with which to do so. It's not impossible for them to go so far as to be a party's <em>tank</em>, especially if they also delve into Peace (easier group shielding, better parrying with magic shields) or Earth (has a long-duration armor buff that can outclass <em>full plate</em>) magic; the main restriction on all this is that much of humanity in the main setting does not think kindly of the supernatural.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em> subverts this in various ways. Mechanically spellcasting depends heavily on a character's Rings. Each Ring has two traits, one physical and one mental, so any Shugenja (spellcaster) worth his scrolls has at least one good physical trait. Fire users are very agile and Earth casters are very durable for example so the "Wizard" is not much more "squishy" than any other character. There are no class restrictions to wearing armour and wielding honking big swords if someone is a shugenja either; the restrictions are largely <em>social</em>. Carrying a katana implies that you know how to use it, wearing armour states that you are a military combatant rather than a priest like other shugenja.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion">Aion</a></em> follows this trope in an odd way. Sorcerers and Spiritmasters, who use offensive spells (and summoned monsters in the SM's case) are forced into wearing robes and having little HP in exchange for bending the universe to their will, and thankfully have some shield spells as protection. Clerics and Chanters (healing and buffing classes respectively) however, apparently don't spend as much time with the books, being allowed to wear chainmail armor and wield decent weaponry while beating things into submission without the use of offensive spells.
</li><li> Riannon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquapazza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquapazza">Aquapazza</a></em> moves much slower than the other characters and relies on long-distance zoning tactics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em>'s wizards and other magic users are generally fairly squishy, particularly at lower levels. Taken to extremes with the Dark Adept, who has no melee attack at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenSkyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenSkyTrilogy">Below the Root</a></em>: Pomma starts out with the highest spirit score, and is considered a holy child (meaning she gets favorable treatment from both Erdlings and Kindar) but is a physically frail nine-year-old girl who needs to look for strength boosting elixir and/or take frequent meals and naps to prevent keeling over. A more robust character like Neric won't need as frequent naps or meals, but had to seek out more training to boost his spirit score, and may not get a warm welcome at certain houses.
</li><li> The spellcasters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor">Betrayal at Krondor</a></em> are an interesting example. Seeing as casting spells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">depletes stamina and then health</a>, in that order, they're technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> mechanic-wise while <em>not</em> being actual Squishy Wizards; They are less tough than the warriors and casting spells by itself makes them more vulnerable to going down if an enemy lands a hit on them, but in-game logic dictates that they're actually pretty physically tough to be able to cast powerful spells for a prolonged period of time. That being said, Owyn begins the game with strictly inferior weaponry, strength, health, and defense, eventually climbing his way to badass only by participating in the majority of the game's battles, stat-boosting sidequests, and training sessions. Another playable spellcaster, an old man named Patrus, has such horrid physical stats that he'll probably spend most fights on the ground, bleeding to death.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em>Krondor</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalInAntara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalInAntara">Betrayal in Antara</a></em>, features Aren, who starts off much the same as Owyn; weak armor, low stats, and poor movement. Justified, as all magic in the game is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, and he only really gets any useful spells after the first act of the game is over.
</li><li> In-universe example with Noel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>. She's stated to have received below average academic and athletic scores from testing, but she makes up for it by having the highest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Ars Magus</a> aptitude score <em>ever recorded in the history of the NOL Military Academy</em>. The poor athleticism thing seems to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">Informed Flaw</a>, though; her fighting style is very acrobatic, though she <em>is</em> quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> in gameplay terms, so maybe it is true.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfMana">Children of Mana</a></em>, Poppen has the best magic stats of all four playable characters, but atrocious defense and HP.
</li><li> The Controller and Defender archetypes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>. They're "wizards" in that they possess a far greater range of powers than the more combat-oriented archetypes and have access to heals, buffs, debuffs and status effects that the others generally don't. They also have the joint-lowest hit points and virtually no defensive capabilities. The Blaster, Controller and Defender are, in fact, often collectively referred to as "Squishies" by the players of other archetypes (though the Blaster is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>).
<ul><li> In <em>City Of Villains</em>, the Corruptor, Dominator, and Mastermind fill this position — although the Corruptor overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, and the Mastermind is the best pet summoner and when used right is almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. The game in general is a bit less focused on party roles and the "balanced party" concept than usual, resulting in more aberrations to the norm. Powerset and build choices are significant to level of squishiness, and an occasional complaint with recruiting certain Defender subtypes is that their personal survival abilities are so good they'd rather be soloing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClashOfClans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClashOfClans">Clash of Clans</a></em>, Wizards shoot powerful fireballs, but can't take much of a hit. The Zooka (a bazooka-wielding female soldier) is the equivalent in <em>Boom Beach</em>, made by the same developer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion">Dark Devotion</a></em> has Nekosh, Keeper of the Books. He can mess you up with his fire magic and demonic scythe, but once he gets off his pulpit and comes within your reach, youll discover that he has very little health for a boss: you can kill him with just a few attacks. Of course, killing him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">is not the end of that fight</a>

Although the wizard class starts with the lowest strength and the weakest weapons, through the use of attribute enhancing rings and elixirs, it is possible to have wizards who have similar strength to a warrior as well as the capability of wielding weapons from other classes.
<ul><li> As well as having typical druid powers, like transforming into a werewolf. Still pales in comparison to the damage they can put out with magic and throwing weapons, however. (Especially due to the cancellation glitch, moving while in the middle of a throw stops the animation, allowing for a rapid-fire attack)

It's also lampshaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> as V struggles to get around Red Grave City without falling over, can barely keep up with Dante without tiring himself out and, unlike other characters, he realistically struggles to lift <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Sparda</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's also revealed that V is dying since he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> and can only save himself by fusing with Urizen, whereupon he becomes Vergil.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDenpaMen">The Denpa Men</a></em>, Denpa Men with antennas (essentially, magical powers) have far weaker physical stats and tend to be slower than Denpa Men without skills. The more offensively-oriented the skill, the weaker their stats tend to be, too—so a Denpa Man who can blast all enemies with light will have weaker stats than one who can merely blast one enemy with light, who will have weaker stats than the speed-upper, who will have weaker stats than the 'man who merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntidoteEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntidoteEffect">cures Poison for a living.</a>
</li><li> The Necromancer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> is overpowered in the offensive spells department, and at the same time is frustratingly squishy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> has two such classes: the Wizard and the Witch Doctor. Interestingly, the Wizard himself is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> than the Witch Doctor. The former deals a large amount of direct damage, while the Witch Doctor relies on summoned pets, indirect damage and status effects.
</li><li> Mages and Skulls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> are by far the frailest units in the game. The exception to the rule (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Flonne</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">properly trained</a>) easily demonstrates why; magic units that could take a hit would be total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc One Nukes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiverDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiverDown">Diver Down</a></em>, and more specifically the character of Jenna, demonstrates why this trope should never be applied to a system that doesn't allow casters to leave the front lines. Better cast a protective spell at the beginning of any tough fight, or she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">going down</a>.

</li><li> Mages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> are, in theory, the squishiest class. In practice, mages tend to a) put a truckload of points into Constitution to fuel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>, b) pick the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Arcane Warrior</a> specialisation and run around in full plate, c) pick Spirit Healer and just heal the damage back, or d) pick Arcane Warrior <em>and</em> one of the other specialisations mentioned above and thus out-Warrior the party Warrior. It's just as much of an issue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, which lacks Arcane Warrior but gives the Spirit Healer specialisation a passive talent that gives them +10 Constitution and significantly increased health regeneration.
</li><li> In effect somewhat different in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>: while Mages do have lower than average Resilience and HP as well as less gear that provides decent defense available, you can still give them roughly average durability with the right gear... it's just a bad idea. You see, unlike with Attack, weapons do not give a very significant boost to Magical Might; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman">most of the boosting for that stat comes from your clothing.</a> So, while you could have a mage with a decent amount of durability <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">it comes at the cost of magic powerful enough to do decent damage.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em> mages and sorcerers can only wear the lightest armor, and have to stand still to cast their spells. On the other hand, the hybrid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> class carries the biggest shields in the game. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageMarksman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageMarksman">Magick Archer</a> class has roughly the same defenses as a normal archer.
</li><li> Just like in the regular game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a></em> makes wizards and sorcerers the squishiest of all the playable classes, with elven and drow mages being especially squishy due to lower Constitution. Playing them is mainly reserved for those who are good at the game, as just like the regular game, low levels can be unforgiving as hell for mages. Also those who know exactly what spells they'll need for their next quest; wizards in particular are designed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">And Knowing Is Half the Battle</a>... um, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>.

It is entirely possible to have what is otherwise a mage-type that uses heavy armor (which in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> will also lead to the stat governing health being more advantageous and easy to increase). When it comes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the removal of the class system means that this trope is more something you grow into as you put more resources into magicka and your magical skills than something you <em>start</em> as.
</li><li> In-universe, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Altmer (High Elves)</a> are the most physically frail race on average, but also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">the highest natural talents for magic</a>. They do employ armed-and-armored soldiers as well, but each and every one of these soldiers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">uses magic as a supplement in combat</a>, and still tends to be squishier (on average) than the standard rank-and-file soldiers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">more combat oriented races</a>, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>.

Notice that says <em>physically</em> frail, as the Bretons have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">highest resistance to magical attacks</a> of any race — Man, Mer, or Beast.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, equipping heavy armour decreases your Intelligence and Soul stats, so if you equip your mages with heavy armour, their magic will be almost useless, and if you equip your mage with light armour, they'll take heavy damage when they're hit. This was changed in the GBA/PSP <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, so heavy armour will no longer decrease your magic stats, so now your wizards won't be squishy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">Edward</a> can use his instruments to put status effects on opponents, but suffers from low HP, weak defences, and subpar attack strength (to the point where Edward would lose a purely physical fight with Rydia, <em>a seven-year-old-girl</em>). In the GBA version, this is inverted beyond level 70, as his stats undergo the greatest gain potential; but that's only if he's taken into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> combined with a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>.
</li><li> Tellah zigzags this. Early on, he's one of the few examples anywhere of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> Wizard, averting this. When he first joins your party, his HP is significantly higher than the other characters, and the enemies are still weak enough that he can take some damage. When he comes back, he becomes a stone wall <em>again</em>, as he is still initially sturdier than Palom and Porom, and until you complete Mt. Ordeals, he lacks most of his spells and his only real purpose is to help the kids conserve MP. As the game goes on, he gradually eases into the role of Squishy Wizard as his stats actually <em>decrease</em> with level-ups. By the time his role in the game is finished, he is far and away the physically weakest character in your roster, so much so that his physical weakness becomes plot-relevant.
</li></ul></li><li> Aerith, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, fits this role quite well, especially if you load her up with enough attack magic Materia, which boosts the MP and Magic stats while nerfing her HP. Though her healing magic can negate this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> Aeirth is certainly a Squishy Wizard as well considering Tifa, Zack and Cloud could survive getting slashed (and even impaled in Cloud's case) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sephiroth</a>... while Aeirth <a class="urllink" href="https://i0.wp.com/capinaremos.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/aerith-s-death-o.gif?resize=464%2C325">on the other hand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> provides the means to subvert this trope The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">red mage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">white mage</a> can both be very survivable if they are equipped correctly, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">blue mage</a> isn't all that bad a starting point for a non-squishy spellcaster either. The combination of the spell Stoneskin, which provides what's effectively a small pool of bonus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>, and Utsusemi, an ability to nullify hits that is activated through expendable tools which can be accessed by setting your support job to Ninja, is the most powerful and popular way to do it, but there are other approaches as well.
</li><li> Lulu and Yuna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> do not take hits well at all. At the very least, they both make up for it by having the best evasion stat in the game and simply dodging. Oh, and for some reason Lulu comes with game-best physical defense, though not enough to offset her game-worst HP by much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> has Hope Estheim. He has the highest magic stat in your party and is the only one who can learn every offensive spell. However, he also has the lowest HP in your party.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nu Mou race in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>. They are small in stature and have <em>very</em> slender limbs, making them a magnet to enemies who have high attack power, like the Bangaa. Obviously, the Nu Mou have the best magic stat out of all the races and use many kinds of offensive and elemental spells.
<ul><li> <em>A2</em> somewhat lampshades the physical weakness of the nu mou by having one of the nu mou clan leaders in a cup tourney asking you to be gentle on them since they are old and their bones aren't what they used to be.
</li><li> Conversely, Geomancers, the only magic-focused Gria, have below-average magic attack (and physical attack) but very high physical and magical defense. This very much makes them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Masters of None</a>, because the still below-average HP and limited armor selection makes their defense only slightly above average.

</li><li> Merlin, the wizard in the classic game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a></em>, has the worst armor (he has zero, actually), and he's hopeless at fighting. However, when it comes to his magical ability, <em>watch out</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, where <em>every</em> character uses offensive "magic", Ivan stands out. He's got the lowest defense and attack of the party, worse than even Mia, the healer. However, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> in addition to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, his weapons' special effects activate much more frequently than anyone else's, and with the right sword, he can deal tremendous physical damage.
<ul><li> This seems to be a theme of Wind Seer class accessed by Jupiter Adepts as Sheba from <em>The Lost Age</em> and Ivan's daughter Karis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em> all share the same high agility and psynergy points but bottom of the barrel HP, attack and defense.

</li><li> Earth Elementalists are the extreme however. They have an armor spell that alone adds more armor than a Warrior has, Ward Against Melee, which causes 50% of enemy melee attacks in an area whiff, Ward Against Elements, which provides a healthy bonus against elemental attacks, and Eruption, which blinds (90% miss chance) enemies in an area for up to 15 seconds. With the addition of other spells, an Earth Elementalist can prevent huge amounts of damage to himself and his party.
</li><li> Played straight with mesmers though. Low armor, almost no direct damage dealing capabilities, and an extreme lack of self heals means that this is a VERY squishy wizard.

</li><li> Ansem, Seeker of Darkness is a played-with villainous example. While he doesn't have the lack-of-health-and/or-defense you typically see in characters of this trope, he still favors hit-and-run <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> and relies on his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Guardian</a>" to do the up-close attacking for him. However, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form subverts this by giving him a physical weapon, though he only uses this at the end of the very first game.

Muscle increases your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>, and Moxie increases your evasion chance. There is no defense given by high Mysticality though, so if you don't increase your other stats Saucerors and Pastamancers end up pretty squishy. While Saucerors gradually become less squishy be gaining access to powerful regeneration effects, Pastamancers don't have that luxury besides summoning certain Thralls to aid them defensively. The Avatar of Jarlsberg is a step up in both squishiness and wizardliness: their spells are always pretty damaging and can conjure up the best foods, but have limited healing and <em>refuse</em> to attack physically (due to Jarlsberg's crippling germophobia).

The main thing that makes the Death faction's special creature the Lich superior to other mages isn't its immense mana pool, but the fact that it has decent physical stats and the Defend ability, allowing it to cast some spells and turtle up instead of you devoting all your concentration to keeping it alive.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">the first game</a>, all of the "support" classes (Engineer, Adept, Sentinel) have powerful support abilities based around technology or biotics, some of which border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, but can only wear lightweight armor. The more combat oriented classes with support abilities (Infiltrator, Vanguard) have more armor and weapons skills but consequently less support capability. On the other hand, all biotics can learn Barrier, which provides <em>significantly</em> better shields than the best armor Soldiers can buy. And their lightweight armor tends to provide better defenses against biotic and tech attacks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Quadratic</a>, indeed. However, the Engineer was the squishiest because in addition to lacking Barrier, it lacked the firepower that makes the other two classes Glass Cannons and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> so this class would have to be doing a <em>lot</em> of hiding behind cover and allies in the early game with so many enemies that were either organic (ex. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombiePukeAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombiePukeAttack">Thorian Creepers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Rachni</a>) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Geth</a> too high-level to immediately take on without some <em>serious</em> level-grinding.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">the sequel</a>, Shepard can wear any type of armor regardless of class, but the support classes tend to have somewhat lower health. In addition, the squad members with biotic and tech powers tend to have lighter armor, with characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">Mordin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Tali</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Kasumi</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Jack</a> having little to no armor at all. Oddly enough, while Engineers and Adepts are not noted for having strong shields (Engineers in particular are advised to only stick their heads above cover when they have to), the Sentinel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>, Tech Armour, makes it surprisingly durable, especially if combined with a talent like Energy Drain in <em>3</em>, which in extreme cases will allow a Sentinel to stand out in the open, in front of basic geth troops, without actually losing any health.
</li><li> Most of the multiplayer Adept variants in <em>3</em> are pretty squishy...except of course the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Krogan Shaman</a>, who is a six hundred pound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER">Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1">Mother 1</a></em> is the only party member capable of using offensive PSI and has huge library of PSI abilities (both offensive and healing). Her attack and defense are abysmal however, her non-PSI attack does one maybe two damage and while her PSI attacks are useful in battle she's typically knocked out before real use can be made of them. She can make a great healer but can't use her powers if knocked out (which is often) ironically she learns the PSI to revive knocked out members far before anyone but being unable to use them on herself means lots of expensive hospital trips. Made worse is the fact she joins the party at Level 1 while other party members are typically between the Level 18-30 mark meaning lots of level grinding to get her to the point were she can survive.
</li><li> Similar story with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>'s Paula who also starts out at level 1 when you get her and you have to travel through an area that has monsters that tend to one shot her. Although unlike Ana, she doesn't stay as that squishy and she isn't totally incompetent in physical damage as is the norm for this trope.
</li><li> Kumatora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, unlike her predecessing PSI users, is touted as a tougher, more masculine character, yet is still physically behind her partners Lucas (a preteen) and Duster (a <em>leg-impaired thief</em>) while being just about even with Boney (a <em>dog</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Miriene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysticArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysticArk">Mystic Ark</a></em>, though to compensate, she's the only character in the game who learns a spell to protect allies from spells for a limited amount of time.
</li><li> Being based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> series follows the trope. Pure wizards start with pathetic hit points — it's absolutely impossible to survive without allies to act as tanks, because you start with pathetic defensive spells and anything that so much as sneezes on you will rob you of all your hit points. And you can't even go all tin-can happy, because wearing armor reduces your spellcasting abilities. It takes a surprising amount of progression before you can cast enough defense to afford some tanking yourself; in the meantime, you'll be entirely dependent on your party for survival.
</li><li> Wizards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus Clash</a></em> are no more durable than they were at their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamNormal">Mortal</a> beginnings. Some Wizards learn an elaborate array of defensive spells and enchantments to make up for this, but others believe that the best defense is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">good offense</a>.
</li><li> 9S in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> can't hit as hard as 2B <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or A2</span> and can only carry one weapon, but has the ability to hack enemy units to cause them to self-destruct for massive damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler">Octopath Traveler</a></em> has Cyrus and Primrose, both of whom boasting strong elemental attack power for their spellwork (Cyrus has access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning">Fire, Ice, Lightning</a> by default while Primrose casts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark elemental</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">spells</a> by default). They also have pitifully low HP and physical attack status, and their physical defense is nothing to brag about, either.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outward">Outward</a></em>. You start out unable to use magic and can only get mana by temporarily trading maximum HP and stamina for it. The more you load up on mana, the squishier you'll be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em>, this is the case with most of the primary magic-users; Raja and Kyra, both potent magicians, benefit very little from being armed with physical weapons (Raja because he has low attack power and low natural defense, and Kyra because her magic is plentiful and much stronger than her regular weapon attack anyway). Designated party wizard Rune can cast so many spells between visits to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Trauma Inn</a> that he can reasonably be given <em>two shields</em> as opposed to a weak staff. Since most other characters have their hands tied with weapons, this easily puts Rune's defense on par with everyone else. Early on when he first joins the party, giving him two shields, putting him at the front, and letting him clear the screen of monsters in one or two rounds is the best way to level grind. It's entirely possible to spend most of the game with your squishy wizards near the front of the party while your melee fighters take a safer spot at the back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em>, the technique (magic) using class called Forces have nearly negligible physical attack and defense power and upon reaching ultimate difficulty, their own magical attacks become mostly ineffective against enemy resistance. However, once they find high-level disks for the spells Deband and Jellen, all Forces break this trope entirely and are capable of boosting the party's defense and lowering the enemy's attack so much that they become like kittens.
</li><li> As a psychic example, Alakazam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">Pokedex</a> fluff in Emerald, its muscles are so weak that it has to use its psychic powers just to stand and move around.
<ul><li> Most Psychic Pokémon are infamous for having low defense and HP in contrast with high speed and Special Attack. The exceptions are usually Legendary Pokémon. Even Mewtwo became this when the Special stat was divided into two stats. Also, Alakazam has the second highest permanent base Special Attack of all non-legendary Pokémon, beat only by Chandelure (though Porygon-Z ties with it; Zen Mode Darmanitan and Blade Forme Aegislash also beat it, but only as long as they're in their corresponding formes). Pokémon with high Special Attack and Speed are called Special Sweepers. In competition, Special Sweepers are used to wipe out as many Pokémon as quickly as it can before ultimately dying... very good examples of glass cannons in action. (Chandelure, for the record, has competent defenses, and thus does not fit this trope quite as well as Alakazam, although it does have low HP.)
</li><li> Other notable examples include Gengar, Mismagius, Florges, and several Electric-type Pokémon, such as Jolteon, Manectric, and Heliolisk.
</li></ul></li><li> The Wizard class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest">Puzzle Quest</a>: Challenge of the Warlords</em> suffer from this. Battle (Attack power) and Morale (Hit Points and spell resistance) stats are the lowest of the four class AND the most expensive to upgrade (3 points each per Level Up. You only get four points to spend). But he does gain the powerful Fireball spell fairly quickly, and in the upper levels (around 35 or so) becomes an efficient death-dealing machine. (The Druid is similarly HP-challenged, but has some of best defensive spells in the game and learns them fairly quickly.)
</li><li> Wizards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em> are quite squishy. They do have a shield that uses their mana to soak up damage, though.
</li><li> Mages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RetroMud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RetroMud">Retro Mud</a></em>, which is balanced out by the fact that they don't see much danger.

</li><li> Casters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom">Ryzom</a></em> can be utterly <em>devastating</em> with high-level spells and magic, but have to wear light armor to get the most out of it without a penalty and may have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a> if they want to not use too much Sap (the game's equivalent to Mana); thus, should their target survive long enough to get into melee range (or otherwise retaliate)... the Caster likely won't.

His HP, attack and defence stats are decisively below average, in addition to his slow movement rate and horrible turning radius.
</li><li> Oichi in her third game incarnation is similar. Using magically conjured shadow hands to attack and throw mooks about from a great distance, Oichi's body is in itself little more than a puppet dragged along by those very same hands and is defenceless without them. Like Yoshitsugi she depends mostly on keeping enemies at a safe distance where she can keep stun-locking them.

However, a single Zergling can kill one of these guys if it makes it into melee range. This more or less applies to all the other casters in the game as well.
<ul><li> Only in game though. In the lore a High Templar is a <em>veteran</em> zealot who has no issue slaughtering a dozen zerglings in hand to hand without even bothering to strap his armor on.

A Soldier who cross-classes into a Guardian ends up more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>, as they don't have the sheer power of a Consular, but they won't <em>need</em> it with that much hit points. Kreia in the second game is <em>very</em> squishy, especially since she also loses a hand early on in the story, but her ability is to share buffs with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>. The Disciple in the same game is a subversion; starts off as the tankier <em>Soldier</em> class, and <em>then</em> cross-classes into Consular with enough influence, meaning you have a tank (heavy armor, heavy weapons) who can put out crazy amounts of Force abilities. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, the Consular Sage is a classic case of this, meaning they'll be leaning heavily on their companion to do the tanking.

However, this trope only applies to his lack of physical attacks; his Force-Lightning-based attacks are nothing to sneeze at, his Force Dash gives him a downright scary burst of speed, he has good health/defense, and his Imperial Resources ability can even heal nearby allies (or, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">himself</a>).

However his V-Trigger, Dokunomu puts a poisonous aura around him upping his defense greatly.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em>Suikoden</em> mages play this straight. However, due to the front and back line nature of the party (that is to say, a full party of six will always have three in front, and three in back), and that only certain enemies and attacks can hit the back row, mages are pretty safe. To provide balance, the primary casters are only able to use short range weapons, weapons that can only attack from the front row. Given how few spells a mage can cast before resting during the early game, you're stuck between letting the mage get the crap beaten out of her, or letting her do nothing half of the time.

However, these defensive spells are subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cooldown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cooldown">cooldown</a> and thus need to be used at the right time, which is trickier than simply relying on a warrior's superior armor and health.

</li><li> Paladins (a tank/healer hybrid) were known to outperform Priests in healing power, but only if they exclusively used cloth items, earning them the nickname Clothadin.
</li><li> Warlocks, on the other hand, tended to prize sheer amounts of stamina (which increases their health) rather than stats that generally improve the amount of mana and mana regeneration. They can essentially trade health for mana <em>instantly</em>, and then drain the life of their victim to recoup the health loss. With proper talents they can also have damage reduction comparable to wearing mail with Soul Link and Demon Armour.
</li><li> Magi, after being nerfed badly, complained on the WoW Fora: "We're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">glass cannons</a> anymore, we're glass peashooters!"
</li><li> Another great example would be the Warlock's Imp minion. It only has long-ranged attacks, which do huge amounts of damage (compared to the other demons at least), however has very low defense and relatively low health. A non-caster could easily kill one in three or four whacks with their weapon.
</li><li> While all three cloth-wearing classes are somewhat fragile, mages are probably the straightest example, as a warlock can rely on their bulky, tanking Voidwalker Minion in solo play, while even shadow priests have some self-healing capability. Mages, on the other hand, don't get a tank minion and are completely unable to heal themselves while in combat.

They are also <em>never</em> armored, have low hit points compared with mid-game enemies, and extremely vulnerable to specific weapons (sword for the Sectoids, and anti-robot weapons for the Codex). One the other hand, the <em>late-game</em> spellcaster enemies, the Gatekeepers and Avatars, are <em>far</em> from squishy, with the Gatekeeper being nearly as heavily armored as the massive Sectopod war machine.

After she was nearly beaten to death by a mutant ninja, she's been learning Tai Chi and learning how to use a scimitar. It appears to have worked rather well, considering her fight against Mule.
</li><li> The "jammers" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowUnit">Shadow Unit</a></em> have reality-warping psychic abilities, but tend to be physically vulnerable for an extremely good reason: killing people with your brain <em>burns calories</em>. A lot of them. And if you think that sounds like a selling point, ask yourself when was the last time <em>you</em> went into ketosis after missing lunch.

<ul><li> Actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a></em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild">The Guild</a></em>, in which, while confronting Zaboo's mom, Tink tells her to lay off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Codex</a>, saying "she's squishy."
</li><li> This is the case of all magic users in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob">Noob</a></em>. The fourth novel explains that there is a trade-off between capability to use magic and physical fitness for the human habitants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame">Fictional Video Game</a>'s universe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Gaea</a> stands out among the characters in such a case, as she sometimes uses it as a semi-legitimate excuse to retreat from battle and consider her teammates (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">including those that are presumably just as fragile as her</a>) as human shields.

<ul><li> Mozenrath of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries">Aladdin: The Series</a></em>. The necromantic magic he uses is VERY powerful, but it continuously drains his physical strength and life energy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> A somewhat more literal example. The episode "Wizard Battle" features a wizard named Abrakadaniel, whose body is squishy:
<div class="indent"><strong>Abrakadaniel:</strong> It's how I survive.
</div></li><li> The Ice King. Without his crown, he has no magical powers, and without his beard, he cannot fly. And he's a scrawny old man.
</li></ul></li><li> Daolon Wong from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> is the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to not possess any hand-to-hand fighting skills and relies entirely on his magical powers. Subverted with Uncle who may not possess as much raw power as Wong, but remains a formidable combatant despite his age and frail appearance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven">Raven</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> isn't as squishy as she could be, seeing as she has at least some martial arts moves, but she's still the most vulnerable to direct physical attack of anyone on the team, and if her spellcasting is interrupted the effect will usually fizzle (or worse, go haywire). Her being the most vulnerable physically isn't just because she's squishy, but also because everyone else on the team has some considerable physical abilities, as the other members are a martial arts master, a cyborg, super strong and a shapeshifter. Her shields are still the way to go to protect the whole team from explosions or similar attacks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, Raven has become so dependent on levitation that she can no longer use her legs properly. This is likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Benders in general are a bit of an interesting balance. Bending is basically a form of martial arts and generally results in most master benders being in excellent shape. However being in good shape doesn't automatically translate into actual combat skills, and most Benders are so used to relying on their powers that without them they're basically helpless against someone with actual combat training, or simply someone stronger than them. Certain individuals like Zuko and Azula seem to have significant combat training outside of their bending, but this is by no means the norm. This ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weakness</a> when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">chi-blocking</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">Ty Lee</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> for how she closes in on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">benders</a> and turns off their powers with just a few simple light yet precise jabs, leaving them completely vulnerable until it wears off.
<ul><li> With that said even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a> like Azula falls under this trope due to her lack physical strength which is justified since she's a 14 year old girl. During the siege of Ba Sing Se, Aang was getting trounced by Azula until he made a Earth Bending stone fist and pushed her back effortlessly. In the comics Zuko her older brother could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lift</a> Azula like she weighed nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> Katara is a waterbending master, but she lacks physical strength, isn't very agile, and has no talent for hand-to-hand combat. She's completely helpless without Bending, as lampshaded by Mai in "Return to Omashu". In the episode "The Waterbending Scroll", Katara tries to run away from the pirates, not yet having the Bending ability to fight them herself, but runs right into Prince Zuko, who is able to grab her with no effort.
</li><li> Similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ozai</a>, despite being in prime physical condition, seems to lack any capabilities outside of bending, and during the eclipse (when both are temporarily without bending) Zuko is able to intimidate Ozai into keeping his distance simply by brandishing his swords. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he loses his bending permanently, he makes up for it by being more cunning and manipulative than usual</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a> again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. She's in good physical condition but she lacks the extensive combat training of Artemis or Robin. Prior to Zatanna's introduction to the show, Miss Martian also functioned like this: she had powerful offensive abilities with her telekinesis and telepathy, but her only defensive abilities were camouflaging herself or phasing through objects and she tended to go down quickly if she was actually hit.
</li><li> Sypha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> outstandingly manages to <em>just avert this</em>, sure she doesn't have crazy physical might of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr">Alucard</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter">Trevor</a> but nevertheless Sypha is much sturdier than any other human woman and possesses far more power than her male companions. In Gresit she survives falling many stories onto rubble, but most impressively Sypha in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> <em>tanks blows from goddamn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> whose able to kill mortals with simple strikes. Still Sypha is still the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe">most injured</a> in the aftermath, so she still has shades of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)</a></em>: Skeletor subverts this trope, but Evil-Lyn and the Sorceress play it straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a></em> has Shadow Weaver. Hordak can do magic, but never stays around long enough for a decent fight.
</li><li> Same deal with Shadow Weaver in the reboot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> she's a master of dark magic, who can be knocked out with one punch.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Twilight Sparkle sometimes is and sometimes isn't shown to be one. Overall, she seems to be a downplayed example. Although she does lack in physical strength, she does have stamina and endurance to spare (necessary for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a> status). Occasionally, Twilight manages to compensate for her lack of strength by using her vast knowledge to accomplish a physical task in the most efficient manner that requires less brawn (as shown when she wins fifth place in a race involving dozens of competitors without using magic, because she knows a lot about the proper technique even though she had never raced before).
</li><li> Presto and Sheila in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>: Presto can conjure all kinds of things from his hat, and Sheila has that invisibility cloak that is handy for sneaking into places they aren't supposed to be. However, they are probably the weakest of the Young Ones when it comes to an actual brawl, lacking Hank and Diana's athletic backgrounds, Eric's shielding, or Bobby's ability to deal damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: Volpina is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a> of Rena Rouge. Rena Rouge has improved physical abilities, but can only use her illusion ability one before losing her powers and needing to recharge. Volpina isn't as strong as Rena Rouge, but can create as many illusions as she wants.
</li><li> Pretty much every dark magician in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> has powerful spells, but is almost helpless in close combat. However, this also seems to apply to many of the elves that use nature magic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">depending on the element</a> with which they are connected. Janai seems to be an exception. Despite her magic, she is primarily a warrior, and quite a good one.
