<ul><li> All of the Straw Hats are like this from time to time, but Zoro and Sanji are the straightest example in that they seem to genuinely dislike hanging out with each other and only respect each other as warriors, while the others members are shown to be able to have fun with each other even if they bicker a lot and are more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, Ritsuko and Misato are presented like close friends since they were college students. However, the former constantly mocks the later's bad traits, such as her being lazy, a slob, or an awful cook, or taunts her about her and Kaji's relationship. On the other hand, Misato actively ignores her taunts or complaints. However, during the course of the series, she starts treating Ritsuko more coldly due to her growing suspicions about Nerv's real mission.

Almost all of them greet him with either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrepareToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrepareToDie">death threats</a>, taunts, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp">glomps</a> which incite the wrath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">any nearby fiancees</a>. Despite this, they stand up for him when he's weakened, accompany him on treacherous journeys (though they often supply the treachery part), and willingly stand with him against impossible odds.

When her so called Best Friend Forever gets dragged down on a staircase by zombies, what does the other girl do? She kicks her in the face to get free. She only gets about half a step before the zombies get her as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, Retasu hangs out with a few other girls from her school who treat her terribly before joining the Mew Mews. She believes they have a certain problem in their lives, and she, by being around them, can help them get over it.
</li><li> Earlier chapters and episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> show that this is the nature of the relationship between Soul and Maka, with Soul constantly teasing Maka for being flat, having fat ankles, being violent, having no sex appeal - you get the point - and Maka often chiding Soul for one thing or another, hitting him over the head with books, making all the decisions without his input, and talking about how horribly sexist men are. That being said, Soul goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">absolutely hysterical</a> whenever something happens to Maka, no matter how small. Maka herself becomes brokenhearted when Soul is hurt and blames herself, deeming herself to be an unworthy meister. They also have several moments that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">show how much they really do care about one another</a>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">holding hands, hugging, and blushing around one another</a>.

Despite their bickering, they were pretty close to achieving their goal and did trust one another. However, after being forced to restart and later Soul nearly getting killed (which in turn led to Maka's blame at herself) did they really mature and thus this did not occur.

<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> we're repeatedly told that Hayato was friends with Amuro when they lived in Side 7. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">It doesn't show</a>, with Hayato going so far as to desert when Amuro isn't executed for, wait for it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">desertion</a>. Amuro, for his part, seems to barely be aware that Hayato is alive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em>, we are constantly told that Beecher and Mondo were really good friends with Judau and Elle (in fact, we're told that Beecher has a thing for Elle). It's never demonstrated, with Beecher's whole personality boiling down to "I'm not Judau's cheering section" and endangering the entire crew to try and maximize his profits. He eventually betrays the <em>Argama</em> to their enemies, and drags Mondo along for the ride; even after this, the show insists on telling us what great friends they are.
</li><li> Kira and Athrun are definite examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>. They are childhood best friends, who for a time hesitated in fights trying to find a way out of having to kill each other. That is until they both kill friends of the other. Then the gloves came off. And even after burying the hatchet and joining forces, they admit to not fully being over it, and even wanting to kill each other still.

Seven years later, they seem to get along fine enough for the neighbors to call them buddies, but Jonathan senses there's no real friendship between them, especially since Dio plans to kill Mr. Joestar and inherits his fortune. After the messes Dio causes in the <em>Phantom Blood</em> arc, Jonathan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">sympathizes</a> with Dio then concludes their relationship, in his word, a bizarre friendship.
<ul><li> Played straight in the <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em> arc with Josuke and Rohan's relationship — they're certainly allies when it comes to stopping the serial killer hiding in Morioh, but other than that the two can't stand each other and don't even bother hiding it. This especially comes into play during the Highway Star arc, where they work together to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> Stand despite clashing with each other <em>while fighting it</em>.

Kaguya has a similar relationship with Fujiwara, viewing her as her best friend one second and mentally declaring her eternal contempt the next (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">only to instantly flop back to friendship when Fujiwara unknowingly wins her favor again</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily">Rather appropriately, Kaguya and Maki are second cousins twice removed</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: This very much describes the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Izuku Midoriya</a> and Katsuki Bakugo. While Bakugo is a very talented, driven, and intelligent individual with a powerful Quirk, he's also a colossal asshole with a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> to boot. Especially since he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> to Izuku for their childhood (at least after Bakugo developed his Quirk and Izuku didn't). No one is sure why Izuku sticks up for or remains friends with him, even still referring to Bakugo with a childhood nickname of "Kacchan" (though interestingly enough, Bakugo never tells him to quit calling him that.) While Bakugo is revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">some moral center and caring</a> and gains some camaraderie with his classmates, his relationship with Izuku still stands out as exceptionally fiery from his end.
<ul><li> An extra chapter has Uraraka note their childhood friendship and coming to the conclusion that Bakugo is <em>afraid</em> of Izuku, which is why he tries to keep him a distance. The panel prior has a discussion that says that Bakugo <em>fears</em> Izuku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">spirit</a> in the same way Izuku envied Bakugo for his strength. The implications are that because of Bakugo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>, he projects his insecurities onto Izuku (thinking his compassion is pity or looking down on him) and that despite his own talent and Quirk, it's Izuku, the Quirkless child looked down upon by society, that is more worthy of being a hero than him. And to someone who holds themselves in high esteem and afraid of showing weakness, it <em>unsettles</em> him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em>, near the end of Part 1, there's a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a> moment where Asahi and Aizawa have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss">Accidental Kiss</a> right as Youko enters the scene, breaking her heart and leaving Asahi a wreck. Asahi's friends respond to the situation by defending Aizawa's honor...which they do by spreading the rumor that he's entirely to blame since he's a shameless womanizing playboy. Homeroom teacher Akari intervenes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chewing out half the cast</a> for destroying Asahi's reputation for the sake of a quick laugh when he needed emotional support more than ever. The characters concede the point (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Shimada</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Akane</a>), and intervene to help smooth things over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuriIsMyJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuriIsMyJob">Yuri Is My Job</a></em>, the vast majority of Hime's friends from elementary school are not exactly good people, since they care more about her cute façade than her as a person. All of said "friends" dislike Mitsuki, and when Hime starts practicing to do a piano duet for the recital alongside Mitsuki, they spread rumors that Mitsuki is bullying Hime. When Hime is forced to back out of the recital, thus causing Mitsuki to believe that Hime betrayed her and expose her as a liar, Hime's friends quickly abandon her. As a result, Hime doesn't really care for said friends and seems more upset about Mitsuki's betrayal than losing her friends.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UselessPrincesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UselessPrincesses">Useless Princesses</a></em>, both the main characters suffer from this trope. When Fujishiro starts trying to befriend Kurokawa, some of her friends, like Miki, take it badly when Fujishiro sticks up for Kurokawa, straining their relationship. Miki, who'd previously looked up to Fujishiro, is especially harsh with her, although Izumi tries to play peacemaker. As for Kurokawa, her group of "friends" suddenly kick her out when they notice her associating with Fujishiro.

After she starts taking care of a kitten together with her classmate Kanda, the others criticize her for spending so much time with someone she used to dislike, and wonder why she's so concerned about some kitten(not realizing that Himari feels responsible). Himari then chooses to go home with Kanda rather than go out to karaoke with her friends, acknowledging that her friendship with the other two is probably over, and not seeming all that bothered by it.

Not very helpful for Jeremy's self-esteem. Emblematic in this sense, the series of strips in which both guys do an IQ test, and Jeremy scores only 38.

Ron, however, will jab back but rarely goes past the limit like Harry does; the extreme difference between their upbringings may explain this. Harry never <em>saw</em> 'playful bickering', pre-Hogwarts — just deadly-serious insults.

Besides considering the slow torture of sapient beings a game (they can win trophies), Fethetrit love to theatrically bluster about their imperialist past in an insanely over-the-top manner: "we raped worlds until they begged for mercy, then raped them harder until they screamed for death!!" At this point, a Pa'haquel usually face-palms (well, the equivalent, anyway) and tells the Fethetrit in question to "sit down, you fool!"

Later, Maggie becomes Editor In Chief of the <em>Washington Post</em> and Ted's boss, and she loves to ''boss' him around! Honestly, it's hard to believe those two are on good terms!
</li><li> The main plot of El Amigo Braulio (<em>My Friend Braulio</em>) by José Manuel González Prada. A young man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Roque</a> publishes some poems in the university's newspaper. Unfortunately, everyone mocks him, specially the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Braulio</a>, whom Roque considers his best friend who has always been there for him. In order to avoid more bullying and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>, Roque decides to use a pseudonym (Genaro Latino) in his next publication and to his surprise, everyone loves it, especially Braulio, who bullies poor Roque and compares him with Genaro Latino. However, thanks to a creepy yet nice classmate who has supported Roque all along, Genaro Latino's true identity is revealed much to Braulio's chagrin. Turns out that Braulio was jealous all along and the story concludes with Roque and Braulio stopping being friends anymore.

It's safe to assume that Arthur is the best friend Ford had during his fifteen years on Earth since Ford chose him to rescue from the Vogons, but they both generally seem to find each other extremely trying. Ford often remarks on how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons">Humans Are Morons</a> and Arthur ascribes several negative qualities to Ford. ("How reliable [is he]?" said Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. "How shallow is the ocean?" he said. "How cold is the sun?") They bicker almost constantly. Given the least opportunity, they tend to go their separate ways. But somehow they generally tolerate each other; Ford hitchhikes across half the galaxy just to see Arthur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a></em> and often tries to keep Arthur out of danger, and once they get the bickering out of the way they occasionally manage to hang out quite peaceably.

Instead of warning his new (and only) friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Cap</a> about being bullied, he uses Cap to shield himself from abuse, although he admits to not being proud of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Cap starts gaining popularity, Hugh jealously turns on him and sets him up get to get brutally tackled by the football team.

And despite all of that, Faith still wanted at least one of them to try and get her to come back.
</li><li> The classic example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> in the close friendship between Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy. When someone asks Kirk whether Spock and McCoy are best friends or bitter enemies, Kirk - with great insight - answers, "I don't think even they know." Later on, when Spock is allowed to invite his closest companions, he asks McCoy as well as Kirk to join him. Dr. McCoy is clearly touched by the honor.

Simply put, teams of two contestants each worked together to answer questions and earn cash. At the end of each elimination round, assuming the last-place team had earned any cash, the team that was being eliminated got to decide whether they wanted to split their earnings ... but the catch was they made their decision separately, setting up the trope. If they wanted to split, they said "Friend," but if they wanted to keep all the money for themselves, they marked "Foe." Thus, one contestant saying "Friend" and the other marking "Foe" meant only the contestant who chose "Foe" kept the money ... thus fitting the "backstabbing" aspect of this trope. (Incidentally, the team split the money 50-50 for a double "Friend" and lost everything on a double "Foe.")

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> crowd will claim this is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango">The Masochism Tango</a> at work. The dynamics are thus: "House is a jerk, his team puts up with him because he's da boss, and Cuddy just doesn't seem to have a backbone." Then there's Wilson, the mousy-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> cancer doctor, to whom House is an unrepentant bully: stealing his food, interrupting his meetings with outrageous claims, pulling pranks on him. Then comes an episode where Wilson says, proudly, that House is his best friend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">* beat* </a> LOL, WUT? (It is worth pointing out that unlike the other characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Dr. Wilson</a> gives as good as he gets, and it's heavily implied that they both enjoy their pranks a lot; it's the rest of the world that just doesn't get them.)
<ul><li> As seen in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYFd9wxCgck">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it's pretty obvious Wilson enjoys pulling pranks on House as well.
</li><li> This is briefly subverted in the episodes immediately following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amber's death</span>. House's seeming insensitivity to Wilson's pain and ducking his responsibility for what happened lead Wilson to tell him, "We're not friends, House. I'm not sure we ever were."

The writers finally took this one to its dark extreme, leaving the friendship imperiled (and the audience hanging) <em>far</em> longer than usual after one prank left its victim in a wheelchair.

<ul><li> In the earlier seasons Clark and Lex make a big deal of how important their friendship is while lying to each other, accusing each other of various crimes (often without cause or evidence of any kind), and making pointed remarks about each other's psychological and relationship problems. How much of this is planned building on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">relationship</a> is an exercise left up to the viewer.
</li><li> In the later seasons Oliver fills in for Lex. They practically do nothing but argue about this and that and in the season eight finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Oliver shoots Clark in the back with a kryptonite dart</em></span>. It's a long story.

Even Zhaan and Crichton, the nicest of the crew, wont hesitate to sell other crewmates up the river if it benefits them.
<ul><li> The subtitle of one multi-part season two arc is even <em>called</em> "With Friends Like These," and involves the crew of Moya throwing together an assault team of a Tavloid (Tav<em>lek</em>), a Sheeyang, a Vocarian Bloodtracker, and Zenetan Pirates (all of whom served as antagonists during the series's first season) to knock over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker">Shadow Depository</a>, kill Scorpius, and rescue D'Argo's son.

</div></li><li> Lord Percy Percy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> II</em> suffers absolute continued abuse from his 'friend' Edmund Blackadder and yet shows utter loyalty and devotion, wanting nothing more than to be Blackadder's friend. While the same applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick">Baldrick of course</a>, he is Blackadder's servant—Percy and Edmund actually have <em>equal</em> status unlike in the first series and yet Percy.
<ul><li> In the same series, Blackadder himself gets the same treatment from one of the many incarnations of Flashheart.
</li><li> Lieutenant George basically takes over Percy's role in <em>Blackadder Goes Forth</em>.
</li><li> And is it arguable that this also applies to Blackadder and Captain Darling from <em>Blackadder Goes Forth</em>. They hate each other, Blackadder envious of his cushy job miles from the trenches and constantly picks on and riles him, yet it is implied that they do know each other well and were possible friends before the war. Their strange friendship is shown the strongest in the final episode (<em>Goodbyeeee</em>), where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not only do Blackadder, George and Baldrick fail to escape 'going over the top', but Captain Darling is also sent by Melchett to join them, and he and Blackadder seemingly bury the hatchet minutes before going to their likely deaths</span>.

The others frequently comment on how much they dislike her, so why is she still there?

</li><li> Vorenus and Pullo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>. Just a few examples: Vorenus kicking Pullo to the curb claiming he is dead to him, the two of them beating each other up to the point of falling off a balcony, insults on the other one's quality of character.
</li><li> Commander Shran in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>. Although arrogant, militant, and speciesist (his favourite nickname for Captain Archer is "pinkskin", and he loathes Vulcans and Tellarites) he has a strong sense of personal obligation and provides more practical help than humanity's Vulcan allies during the Xindi crisis.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: Occasionally Phoebe and Rachel towards Chandler.

It's implied they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">just jealous</a>, as they're mostly single while he and Monica have an unbelievably happy relationship. Plus they normally treat him badly only when Monica isn't around because, given how much she cares about Chandler and her hyper-protective personality, she'd probably kick their asses if they hurt him.

Barney is a pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">assholish</a>, selfish, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulative</a>, abusive, and generally crappy friend as well when things are good and the consequences aren't serious. However, you can always count on him whenever when the shit hits the fan (see: Marshall and Lily's breakup, Ted's car accident, Robin's deportation).
</li><li> When Marshall is finally ready to move on after his breakup with Lily, Barney offers to be his wingman, which consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">picking up every girl that showed an interest in Marshall</a>.

Usually they complain about him until they need something, in which case they go straight to him. The ironic thing is, Chuck is always loyal to Nate. Nate is however a pretty lousy best friend. At one point he temporarily called off their friendship because Chuck sold his club Victrola in order to get money to lend Nate's mother so they could keep their home. Nate is also the guy who got back together with his ex Blair, knowing full well she's the only girl Chuck has ever loved and then proceeded to go to Chuck and whine about how Blair hasn't changed and he doesn't like who she is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek">Dawson's Creek</a></em>: Dawson to <em>everyone</em>. He constantly belittles Pacey, manipulates Joey, treats Jen like crap, ignores Jack, and can't acknowledge any problems other than his own. While he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">idolized</a> by the other characters, the audience is left wondering why any sane human would talk to him. Special examples include dumping Jen when discovering she's not a virgin, ending his friendship with Joey when she gets a new boyfriend a <em>year after he rejected her</em>, almost killing Pacey in a boat race, forgetting his birthday, admitting straight up he uses him to make himself feel better and laughing at Pacey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> behaviour because they're 'just kidding'. (This is after being 'best friends' for sixteen years; in comparison, Jack sees Pacey and his dad interacting ONCE and immediately understands the fraught relationship they have).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a> and Arthur tend to be like this. They bicker and insult each other, but when it comes to it, they do care for each other. Though probably they wouldn't admit it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>.
<ul><li> Even though the four main characters hang out only with each other they snark each other constantly; George Costanza, in particular, is more pitied and tolerated than liked. By the last season, the antagonistic rapport between the main characters has deepened into mutual contempt, culminating in the final scene of the four in jail, complaining about trivialities and each other.
</li><li> When Elaine starts dating "Bizarro-Jerry", who has a much healthier and normal relationship with his George and Kramer like friends, she finds the dynamic creepy and fails to fit it.

<ul><li> Sam Puckett and Freddie Benson. She tends to use him as her personal punching bag, often beating on him or attacking his self-esteem. Though they constantly go head-to-head, they have a few moments that show they do care for each other as friends, like in the episodes "iKiss", and "iReunite With Missy". And in the early episodes, the answer to the question "Why does Freddie put up with Sam?" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">Carly</a>.
</li><li> Also, Sam and Gibby.
</li><li> Thanks to a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, Carly can be this to Freddie at times. Given that she has humiliated him on camera, enables Sam's abuse towards him (To the point where she thinks it's cute that she no longer hits him in the face), and played with his feelings for her on more than one occasion. As this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7269054/1/iWould_Have_Pounded_Him_Silly">fanfic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> points out, Carly has treated guys who have actually wronged her in the past better than she does Freddie.

</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The First Doctor absolutely loathed his initial companions (except Susan, his granddaughter) and would try to get rid of them several times. Even after warming up to them, he'd troll them incessantly by playing a senile fool and then make fun of them when they fell for it.
</li><li> The Third Doctor and the Brigadier: the Brigadier orders the Doctor around and is generally military, while the Doctor snaps and jibes and is generally uncooperative... but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">one of them smiles</a>.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor constantly patronised his companions (called Leela a savage, chewed out Harry for everything, even talked down to fellow Time Lord Romana) yet would unfailingly call them "my best friend(s)".
</li><li> The majority of interaction between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">The Sixth Doctor and Peri</a> is made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults">nonstop bickering</a>.
</li><li> The bickering would rise to unprecedented levels whenever the Doctor met other incarnations, with name-calling and snide put-downs even when they were working together. Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee even kept up a mock animosity at con appearances, despite actually being good friends. Even during "Time Crash" (aka "David Tennant fangasms for five minutes over getting to meet his favorite Doctor"), Ten can't resist slipping in a few cracks against Five, while Five dismisses Ten as a particularly annoying fanboy.
</li><li> One could argue that this defined the relationship between River and the Tenth Doctor. Ten saw her as an incredibly vexing interruption which she found highly amusing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because she already knows about him while he doesn't know her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Reversed parallel timelines</a>, you see..</span>.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>, the three presenters can go from laughing like old chums to legitimately trying to kill one another in the span of seconds. For Instance:
<ul><li> James coming after Jeremy with a machete after Jeremy rear-ended him on the most dangerous road <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">... in the world.</a> This was after he'd been rear-ended (on purpose) several times on the previous leg of the journey.
</li><li> Jeremy throwing away Richard's targa roof in the middle of a snowstorm in the Alps after Richard drove over his drum kit. Jeremy followed this up by forcing Richard to drive faster to make Richard colder.
</li><li> Perhaps this trope is best epitomized by the "Get the Others Shot or Arrested" challenge from the America special. They came disturbingly close to succeeding, too.
</li></ul></li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass">Jackass</a></em> are <em>assholes</em> to each other, pulling horrible and violent pranks on each other all the time. None of them really mind for too long, largely because they are a gang of sadomasochists.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFerals">The Ferals</a></em>. They smack each other upside the head and insult each other at a moment's notice. But break down a have a tearful goodbye when it looks like they'll have to split up.
</li><li> The four main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> (Will, Grace, Karen, &amp; Jack) treat each other horribly, despite apparently being each other's BFFs.
</li><li> Oswald, Lewis, and Kate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em> more often than not screw things up for the title character. It was once revealed that they accidentally messed up Drew's resume for College in High School without him knowing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Oswald</a> hastily wrote one to cover it up and putting idiotic things in it like saying that his favorite animal was a bunny. With how much they mess things up, it's a wonder Drew didn't put poison in their beers and tell them it was a new flavor.
</li><li> Mickey Pearce towards Rodney Trotter on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>.
<ul><li> At some point in the series, Del will be such a manipulative and dangerous friend to Boycie, Trigger, Denzil, and Mike that it is any wonder that they like him at all (and despite everything, we see in <em>Sickness and Health</em> when they thought that he might be dying that they do). Highlights include narrowly escaping an exploding bus, poisoning them with toxic waste, strong-arming Denzil to hand over his redundancy money, and burning Mike's head with an electric paint stripper that he passed off as a hairdryer. Boycie is the only one who comes close to also being this trope. In one early episode, the man was perfectly willing to take absolutely everything that the Trotters owned over a game of cards that he was cheating in.
</li></ul></li><li> Jay and Will from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners">The Inbetweeners</a></em>. The dynamics are like this among the four main characters: Will and Simon are best friends, and Jay and Neil are best friends. Will and Simon both consider Neil a friend in the end due to him being generally nice though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">stupidity</a> often annoys them. Simon and Jay often seem to hate each other, but they have been friends for 13 years, so in the end, they have some grudging respect for each other and sticks together due to simply having known each other for so long. However, Will - the newcomer to the group - and Jay have basically nothing in common. 98 % of their interaction consists of them insulting each other (even interrupting each other's conversations to do it), and Jay trying to get Will in trouble. Jay has a very, very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments towards Will that <em>may</em> suggest they're really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> deep down, but most of the time they are this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> often verged on this.
<ul><li> For one example, in "The Artist," Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy lie to each other repeatedly, fight over the same man (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who turns out to be gay, but they don't know that until the end</span>), and spend the whole episode basically calling each other old, fat and ugly, only for the artist at the end to commend them on what wonderful friends they are.
</li><li> In "Ebbtide VI: The Wrath of Stan" Dorothy winds up in court for inadvertently running a slum with Stan (they had inherited the building, Dorothy was not interested in running it, but Stan blackmailed her into co-owning by threatening to kick out her elderly uncle). During the episode, the three other main characters not only show a shocking indifference to Dorothy's problem (she could easily go to jail for being accidentally tied to the slum) but in fact do several things that make Dorothy look even guiltier - Sophia deliberately makes the court hate her by telling them she put her into a nursing home (which the show treats as a terrible thing for some reason), Rose tries to make Dorthy look guiltier to spice up the story for her consumer advocate job, and Blanche is easily swayed into incriminating Dorothy after the sleazy prosecutor flirts with her.
</li><li> In general, the other's poor treatment of Dorothy really makes one wonder why she puts up with them at all.

</li><li> In "Cat and Mouse", Andrea Moffatt's co-worker Elaine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">who calls her "the Mouse" behind her back</a>, comes to the conclusion that sex is involved when Andrea goes from dowdy to chipper over the course of a few days. She bides her time and waits until Andrea leaves her house so that she can see for herself. She and Guillaume de Marchaux have sex in the 20 minutes that Andrea is gone, which is exactly what Elaine hoped would happen.

But probably the most blatant example is hijacking Anomen's path to knighthood by leading him into bad deeds, giving evil advice, and maybe even blaming him for the inevitable consequences of such behaviour.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens a lot in the first third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>. The party tells haughty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> Luke virtually nothing about their motives, intentionally keeps valuable information from him, and is openly defying the one person he trusts. Then, after Luke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is manipulated into destroying Akzeriuth</span>, they all yell at him for not trusting them.
<ul><li> Luke himself is typically quite abrasive toward his companions (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Ion</a> and Mieu, the only two people who put up with him no matter what he does), refuses to admit that he is wrong or that Van is in any way untrustworthy and is also quite selfish (he wants to save Akzeriuth Van's way because it will make him a hero and because Van promised to take him to Daath). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, he's actually <em>seven</em> so his entire character during that point makes unfortunate sense.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">He gets better</a>, to the point of being the <em>nicest</em> person in the entire game (discounting Ion).

Even if Shadow doesn't consider Sonic a friend, he does work well with him when the situation calls for it; and does seem to at least care a bit about him deep down, despite being loath to admit it.
</li><li> The Babylon Rogues from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders">Sonic Riders</a></em> series come across as this, mostly Wave and Storm who bicker and insult each other to no end, but Jet is also often shown getting annoyed with Wave's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">nagging</a> and Storm's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">daftness</a>, respectively.

In order to find the place where Jim Raynor is imprisoned, the Raiders want to use Colonel Orlan, the best hacker in the sector. Orlan is being kept on ice since the last game by Mira Han, who'll be happy to turn him over... as soon as Jim gives his okay since the imprisonment deal was made with him.

The two fight about everything, from how to approach a job to Michael's decision to retire. Trevor is extremely bitter about Michael giving him up to the police as part of a deal with the FIB and becomes homicidal when he discovers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that their partner Brad was killed, instead of arrested like Trevor thought</span>. Yet, no matter how bad things get between them, they can never stop caring about the other's well being.

For that matter, Hannah seemed perfectly okay with having an affair with Mike, knowing he was dating Emily at the time.
<ul><li> In the present time, Jessica and Emily can get into a nasty catfight. Mike and Matt can wrestle with each other. They still pull pranks on each other which is slightly in poor taste, considering two of their friends (Hannah and Beth) died because of their hijinks the year before.

She assumed Kamen was seeing Hiro behind her back and plotted to kill Hiro and kill herself to frame Kamen for their deaths</span>.

<ul><li> A borderline example, though; Belkar and V are part of the same group, but never actually considered each other <em>friends</em>.

It's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a> when the hero goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> after the brainwashing of all of her friends.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em>: Penny's friends certainly count. They berate each other every chance they get for any kind of flaws and most of the time sponge off one another for their own gain. Oh yeah and not exactly the type to stick around to help when trouble rears its head. All friends have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> moments, Zoe's probably the <em>least</em> out of them, while Lacieniga is undoubtedly the <em>worst</em>...though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">she warms up as the series goes on</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>: Heffer and Filburt can be like this to Rocko in their less sympathetic moments. In "Speaking Terms", Heffer gives Rocko a truly horrible makeshift birthday present, and Filburt tries to exploit their ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudEpisode">feud</a> on daytime television. In fact, there's actually an episode of the show named after this trope. The two don't just go after Rocko, either. Heffer and Filburt also frequently bicker with each other (perhaps even more often), most notably in said episode named after this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>: Phil and Lil DeVille can be like this at times, mostly to Tommy. Two stand-out cases were in the episode "Farewell, My Friend" and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie">The Rugrats Movie</a></em> — in the former, the twins quickly abandon Tommy when he gets tangled up in what all three think is a snake (it's actually a water hose), rush to tell Chuckie, then lament that they've lost their friend when they remembered that Chuckie and Tommy weren't friends anymore; the latter actually <em>drives</em> the story — the twins are so fed up with Tommy's brother Dil that they attempt to take him back to the hospital to get a different baby. When Tommy's constant insistence on protecting Dil over the rest of them gets the better of them, they decide to <em>leave them behind</em>, Chuckie going with them. Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> decided to play a close call on them to get them back together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: Everyone in the family has "friends" like these...
<ul><li> Bart and Milhouse. While it's more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> (they are genuinely close buddies in some episodes), Bart bullies Milhouse on a frequent basis, while Milhouse will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">weasel out on Bart</a> at any appropriate opportunity. Among some of the most egregious examples, Milhouse left Bart and Lisa at the mercy of their bloodthirsty schoolmates in "Das Bus" while Bart once inexplicably set up Milhouse as a fugitive on <em>America's Most Wanted</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">seemingly all just for a quick laugh</a>.
</li><li> Other episodes depict Bart and Nelson in this light - close friends in some episodes, or Nelson trying to bully Bart in others. Bart has also tried to get one up on Nelson as well on more than one occasion, going so far as to trick him into becoming morbidly obese.
</li><li> Homer's regular friends are his drinking buddies (Moe, Carl, Lenny, and Barney) who couldn't care less if Homer is in trouble and would turn against him at the drop of a hat. Not to mention that Moe is constantly hitting on Homer's wife. This is deconstructed in "The Saga of Carl" where Carl betrays the rest of the gang because he felt there was never a real friendship between them.
</li><li> Marge sometimes hangs out with local women (Helen, Maude, Edna, or others) but all these are On and Off friends at best and frenemies at worst, especially in Helen's case who is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> towards Marge and willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens">spread gossip about her</a>. In some episodes, Marge explicitly states that she has no friends.
</li><li> While Janey is the only friend Lisa has (if any at all), she is basically this in a nutshell. She is often seen hanging out with Lisa, but at other times she teases her along with the other children for her misfortunes or idealistic views. Like Marge, Lisa stated numerous times that she has no friends.
</li></ul></li><li> Sonic and Antoine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em>. Antoine acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">stuck-up jerk</a> towards Sonic a lot, and Sonic constantly insults Antoine. While Sonic does show that he cares about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Sally, Tails, Rotor, and Bunnie</a>, it's really hard to tell if he even cares about Antoine. In one episode, when Antoine gets captured, Sonic just labels him an idiot and outright refuses to go after him. Sally is unable to really retort that Antoine would actually save him if the roles were reversed, only coaxing him into the job by reminding him of the potential danger if Robotnik gets a hold of the power ring he had at the point of his capture.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Cartman versus everyone else. He takes this further than most cases of this trope, as Cartman has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">almost no redeeming qualities</a>. Also uncommon for the trope, the other characters will flat out tell Cartman that he is a monster.
<ul><li> Not only do they state he's a horrible person but that they all hate him and the only reason he was ever with anyone was that they thought he was just always following them or that he was with someone else. After realizing this they decided to ignore him completely.
</li><li> The creators stated that Cartman's relationship to the others is based on their assumption that everyone has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">one friend that they don't really like</a>. It's worth noting that in the early seasons, Cartman was just a fat idiot - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">his supervillainish disposition evolved over time</a>.
</li><li> It's summed up in four lines when Stan and Kyle tell Scott Tenorman about Cartman's plan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">have a horse bite off Scott's penis</a>:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Scott</strong>: How do you know?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Stan</strong>: Because we're his friends.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Scott</strong>: So why are you telling me?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Kyle</strong>: Because we hate him.
</div></li><li> Both sides have used (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">rebuffed</a>) the "I thought we were friends" line several times over. They also frequently abuse or manipulate the other in a scheme or convenience and show out and out apathy when they get into trouble. Granted the boys' animosity towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Cartman</a> is <em>far</em> more justified, but still they are willing to ignore all the horrible things he's done if they can profit from it at times.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> has two examples, Patrick Star and Squidward Tentacles:
<ul><li> In the case of Squidward, SpongeBob ends up getting Squidward maimed, or in serious legal trouble by the end of the episode, despite considering him one of his closest friends. A claim that Squidward has passionately denied in numerous episodes.
</li><li> Patrick is a straighter example, especially after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> set in. In numerous episodes that center on the two of them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">Patrick's selfish attitude</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">lack of intelligence</a> gives SpongeBob grief to no end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>: Played with a few times with Baloo and Rebecca. Baloo is slovenly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">slow-witted business wise</a> and occasionally self-centered, Rebecca is pompous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">bossy</a> and occasionally vindictive. They do ultimately care for each other however, Rebecca even labelling Baloo her best friend (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">occasional hints to things going further</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em>: Cassandra and Eugene dislike each other immensely, but are still technically friends and allies, with their relationship to Rapunzel being the glue holding them together. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As of Season 3, not so much.</span>
</li><li> The engines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> are such assholes to each other, sometimes it's hard to remember that they're supposed to be friends. Especially evident in the earlier seasons. Examples include everyone teasing Gordon for his size, making insensitive remarks about Henry's condition, belittling Thomas and Percy for being small engines, jokes involving Edward and scrapping, having your embarrassing accidents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">brought up again and again</a>, and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Despite Plucky Duck ostensibly being Hamton J. Pig's best friend, Plucky routinely forces Hamton into a reckless course of action, then promptly abandons him when things go south. One of the best examples of this is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E4HogWildHamton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E4HogWildHamton">Hog Wild Hamton</a>", where Hamton's parents leave him in charge of their house while they go on their honeymoon. Plucky throws a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a> behind Hamton's back, and the noise of the party disturbs Egghead Junior, who is trying to study, and retaliates by destroying Hamton's house with a missile. Plucky suggests that Hamton lie, which Hamton is against, and when Hamton is about to be punished, Plucky watches from a distance. Karma thankfully saves Hamton when a sweepstakes he entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">at the beginning of the episode</a> rewards him with a new house.
</li><li> Plucky himself has been sold out by Babs and Buster Bunny on numerous occasions as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">the ending to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventuresSpringBreakSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventuresSpringBreakSpecial">the Spring Break Special</a> being a prime example. In it, Buster and Babs spend a majority of the special on the run from Elmyra, who thinks that Buster is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny">Easter Bunny</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and at the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight">she's right</a></span>. At the end of the special, Buster and Babs plant rabbit ears on Plucky, which results in him getting captured by Elmyra. Plucky wasn't doing anything particularly heinous, he was just trying to get a girl duck to like him. Not helping Buster and Babs' case is that they make jokes about the situation instead of showing concern for Plucky's well being.

To the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it led to Optimus being reduced to an Elite Guard Washout as the captain of a Space Bridge Repair crew (which Sentinel never fails to use against Optimus). What makes it particularly hard to understand is the fact Optimus got demoted because he took the blame for the dumb idea that <em>Sentinel</em> came up with: going to a forbidden planet to look for energon</span>. Even worse in the case of Blackarachnia/Elita-1, who Sentinel decides to kill not because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">joined the Decepticons</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or what she did to Wasp</span>, but because she was now a techno-organic (which he considers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>). The irony? Her "death" <em>was the reason why Sentinel hated Optimus in the first place!</em>
</li><li> <em>Transformers: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>: Rattrap and Dinobot. Among Dinobot's last words were a quote from Shakespeare and expressing a desire to be upwind of Rattrap. And Rattrap is glad about it (normally those were fighting words between the two). This could be interpreted as how their friendship trumps death, still... Yet Rattrap is also specifically tasked by Dinobot after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> with making sure no one turns him into an overrated legend in the retellings. In this dislike, there is also trust. And in a scrapped episode for season three, Rattrap disobeyed orders and infiltrated the Predacon base in an attempt to download the original Dinobot's memories into his evil clone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>: Spidey's teammates often have their moments. One example is when they organized a party in Peter's house behind his back, not as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty">Surprise Party</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">to have some fun of their own</a>, as that house was the only one available for the purpose and they didn't even think for a moment about Peter's opinion.
