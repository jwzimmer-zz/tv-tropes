Team Dai-Gurren are running the show though despite their best efforts, they're out of their element for the most part. Even with Simon being the head honcho, it's explicitly implied Rossiu is the bulk of the brains. The next few episodes have him make pragmatic choices that weigh down on him heavily. The team acknowledges this and they're quite understanding about it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After his plan to evacuate people backfires and Simon has to stop the forces, the weight of it and the fact he forced Kinon to have explosives while in Gurren Lagann as a failsafe just breaks him.

</li><li> Colonel Roy Mustang from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst">He calls an ambulance for his subordinate when he himself is practically dying from his injuries</a></span> and blames himself for absolutely <em>everything</em> that goes wrong.
</li><li> Fleet Admiral Sengoku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a very tragic example. He obviously has to do things he doesn't like as befitting his position, and even ends up getting screwed by his own superiors when he's not having to handle pirates. The last straw was the World Government's decision to cover up a mass breakout of several extremely dangerous Impel Down prisoners <em>just to save their reputation</em>. While Sengoku may have done questionable things over the years, he has acted for the good of the world. However, the World Government's decision to cover up the entire incident all together was so bad that he retired on the spot. Two years later, though largely retired, he still maintains a position within the Marines with less responsibility and is <em>far</em> more relaxed and cheerful.
<ul><li> Several other Marines are shown to struggle with this trope. Garp actively avoided it, refusing any and all attempts to promote him to Admiral and stepped down to a lower rank in the same manner as Sengoku over the coverup. Kuzan had no interest in Sengoku's job, but stepped up when learning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Akainu</a> was also nominated, having even fought a ten-day duel with him over the position. After the timeskip, it's already wearing on Sakazuki, with his bosses the Five Elder Stars pushing him to make decisions even his ruthless sense of justice doesn't agree with for the sake of the government saving face at the cost of the Marines' honor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em> this happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Canute</span> — not in the least because holding his position of power makes him act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">in ways he'd have previously found repellent</a>.
</li><li> Jean Kirstein from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> struggles with the very idea that he's a natural leader, doubting his abilities and whether he even deserves that much power over whether others live or die. This leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment after he's forced to use the deaths of several comrades as a distraction, and he nearly breaks down while wondering how many more died on his command. It takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of Marco, his best friend and loudest supporter</span> to make him accept this responsibility and begin believing in himself.
<ul><li> Commander Erwin Smith has had to make several tough calls regarding sacrificing his soldiers for the greater good but when things go bad, it usually falls on his head, particularly after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the failure of the 57th Expedition</span>. He usually has the fortitude to continue on but it's shown that even he has his limits.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, Minako Aino / Sailor Venus is shown struggling under the pressure of her role as the leader of the Sailor Senshi. When she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depowered">temporarily lost her powers</a> in the Dream Arc, unlike the other Inner Senshi, Minako has an existential crisis because being the leader of the Senshi and Serenity's closest guardian, is the only thing that truly matters to her. It culminates in her lashing out at her friends when they talk about the Outer Senshi, because Minako believes that they respect the Outers more than her. Wanting to prove to herself and the Inners that she was a worthy leader, she runs away trying to infiltrate the Dark Moon Circus by herself, risking her own life and the livse of others in the process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> uses this trope with the King of Midland, one of the few examples in the series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a>. Despite being indirectly responsible for the Eclipse (he had Griffin imprisoned and tortured for a year because he slept with the princess), and harboring incestuous feelings for his daughter, it's revealed that he is also a deeply troubled, weary man who wants nothing more than to be relieved of the burden of the crown.

</li><li> On another occasion, Cosmic Boy blows up at Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, telling them about the sacrifices he's made so they can be a happy couple and raise a family, forgoing relationships of his own so the responsibility of running the Legion doesn't weigh as heavily on them.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">Morpheus</a> grew tired of his role as Dream and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">committed indirect suicide.</span>

A bus full of depowered mutants is blown up right in front of her, she tries to get Prodigy to hate her so he'll leave Xavier's and be safer for it, it doesn't work and he breaks up with her (even after discovering this) and she has to deal with the older X-Men who do not take the younger generation seriously, even though, by this point, they've proven themselves to be a capable team.

Wedge, helping make plans for an operation to rescue a defecting Imperial, accepts that he and his people will be the ones who have to make sure any potential disaster stays potential. They have to fly cover, and if they can't adjust to any surprises... Later in the arc, after things went wrong, the Rebel Alliance Council look over the situation and decide that they can't allocate any more forces to helping their people out, to Leia's misery. She'd like to gather up Luke and Han and Lando and pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment, but her sphere of responsibility is so much wider now, and she has to apply to other conflicts.
</li><li> In another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars</a></em> comic arc, one that shows the men behind the masks in the Imperial army, Lieutenant Janek Sunber is put in charge of setting up defenses by the general. They have to hold against an unstoppable wave of alien natives (an homage to <em>Zulu</em>). During the fighting, while he and his men are falling back, the stormtrooper next to him is hit in the back by a spear. The narration notes that most men, when a comrade near them is killed, feel relief that they were not the one to die. Sunber, on the other hand, feels dismay that he couldn't save the man, that he didn't even know his name, and worst of all, that it doesn't matter, because the rest of the men need him. He even tried to drag the stormtrooper to safety before another officer pulled him away.

She ended up with the job only because her ex-boyfriend, the original team leader, betrayed the team and then died. She did okay for a while because she had Karolina cheering her on and Gertrude handling the practical matters. But then Karolina admitted that she had feelings for Nico, and when Nico rebuffed her, she left the team and found love with a Skrull. Karolina later came back, but then Gertrude died and Chase ran away (he came back eventually.) She fell back on Victor for a while for emotional support, but then he cheated on her. Things stabilized for a while, but then the events of "Home Schooling" came along - the Runaways' home got bombed, Old Lace died, 12-year-old Klara suffered a concussion and went berserk, and Chase ran away again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then got hit by a car</span>. Thankfully, Nico somehow managed to pull the team back together in time to deal with Dark Wolverine, but she probably won't be winning any awards for leadership anytime soon.
<ul><li> Reflected on in the 2017 series. Gertrude notes on thus as to why Nico is enthusiastic on training under Doc Justice and having the team be under them. She doesn't have to bear the burden of it. Given what the hell happened between Gertrude's death and resurrection, not hard to say.

She enjoys her decadent lifestyle free of nearly any real responsibilities (besides arguing with Schneizel so dissidents are drawn to her rather than a true enemy of the crown) and would be stuck with the incredibly stressful job of ruling if she did overthrow him.

<ul><li> The story of the sword of Damocles is an ancient anecdote, memorably told by Cicero about Dionysius II, who was the tyrant of Syracuse in the 4th century BC, and one of his courtiers, named Damocles. Damocles said that with all of his wealth and possessions, Dionysius must be the most fortunate man who ever lived. Dionysius offered him to try his fortune, and he accepted. Dionysius held a banquet where Damocles was treated like a king, and felt happy...until he looked up, and saw a heavy sword over his head held up by single horse-hair. This sword, which could fall at any time, was put there to symbolize the constant fear and potential danger that Dionysius faced as a result of his power.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> saw the main characters follow the British tradition of Boxing Day by having the enlisted and officers switch roles for the day. Of particular note are Colonel Potter's and Klinger's switched roles. Colonel Potter gains new respect for Klinger when he finds out just how much work is involved in being company clerk and Klinger gains new respect for the Colonel when he learns just how much weight the burden of command carries and having to be responsible for making extremely tough decisions.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the more humanizing moments for Dr. Kelso, he puts Dr. Cox in charge of trying to figure out how to balance the budget without firing someone. Much to Cox's chagrin, he can't, and Kelso points out that he doesn't (always) make his decisions because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>; sometimes, it's the only way to keep Sacred Heart running.
</li><li> Another great Kelso example is the end of an episode where J.D. shadows him all day trying to find something nice to say about him (but fails). Specifically on that day, Kelso put a rich patient ahead of a poor one for an experimental medical treatment that was his only hope (because the rich guy will now donate tons of cash to the hospital, allowing them to continue offering medical care to homeless and uninsured pregnant women). Kelso acts like it was an easy call that doesn't bother him, but the episode ends with him letting his guard down with nobody around. He looks incredibly shaken and forlorn as he walks to his car.
</li><li> After Kelso's retirement, Dr. Cox is made the new Chief Of Medicine, and quickly finds just how brutal the trappings of the job really are, and it quickly costs him both any time for actually practicing medicine, and time with his family.

<ul><li> Tony Soprano is very savvy about this issue and is unable to decide which he feels more strongly: the stress or the benefits of being mob boss.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tony:</strong> All due respect, you got no fuckin' idea what it's like to be Number One. Every decision you make affects every facet of every other fuckin' thing. It's too much to deal with almost. And in the end you're completely alone with it all.

<ul><li> General George Hammond of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> has it tough as head of Stargate Command. He has to juggle the conflicting issues of his SG teams and their safety, the Air Force, the president, other politicians, and of course, the safety of the galaxy as a whole. The point is driven home when Jack O'Neill is promoted and takes over for Hammond and almost quits because "he can't fill Hammond's shoes".
</li><li> Same thing with Dr. Weir, Colonel Carter, and Mr. Woolsey during their respective times as the leader of Atlantis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>. While the IOA likes to interfere and chew them out for not following protocol, they always refuse to make decisions, instead leaving the leader to make the tough calls and then deal with being chewed out for making said tough decisions (vicious cycle, no?)
</li><li> Later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>, Jack O'Neill chews out Colonel Young for hesitating and making the wrong (no) call, pointing out that literally moments ago Colonel Carter left two people to die so her ship and crew would be saved.
</li></ul></li><li> Long story short, pretty much every captain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> feels this at some point. This includes all the spin-offs, and even one shot captains often wind up feeling the burden of command before their spot is over. Readers of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> books can pick out scenes that mirror ones from the novels, which were a direct inspiration for the series.
<ul><li> Really, this has been in Trek ever since the <em>very first pilot</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">Captain Christopher Pike</a> discusses the possibility of resigning, tired of being responsible for the lives and deaths of his crew.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, "Thine Own Self", features Troi taking the bridge officer's test, which she keeps failing until she realizes that the win condition is saving the ship by sending a virtual crewman to certain death. This in turn ties into an earlier episode, "Disaster", where, due to an accident, Troi is stuck as the senior-most officer on the bridge but her rank was conferred based on her counselor position, not her technical or command experience. So she has to rely on the junior officers to explain the situation to her and make a gut call which, based on the above latter episode, she made wrong. It's only by luck that her decision didn't get anyone killed, something that she acknowledges which is what leads her to seek that bridge officer qualification later on.
</li><li> Starting with TNG, the captain often isn't permitted to enter dangerous situations as Kirk frequently did; the first officer goes in their place, because the captain is the single most indispensable person on the ship.
</li><li> Sisko lives and breathes this trope from day one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. He has to deal with the volatile and extreme politics of Bajor, the machinations of the Cardassians, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dominion War</span>, his role as Emissary of the Prophets, an (initially) uncooperative first officer, and the difficulties of single fatherhood on top of his regular duties as the commanding officer of one of the busiest and most strategically important space stations.
</li><li> Janeway started to embody this trope over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. Entire episodes would revolve around her being forced to make tough calls about whether or not to compromise the Federation's ideals in order to help get Voyager home. She's much more isolated than the other captains, who can apply to (or have to <em>answer</em> to) Starfleet, but cut off in the Delta Quadrant she's more like the captain of an old wooden ship far from home port.

In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>, he is the President of the United States, only to find himself confronted with a crisis where he must make a critical decision without concrete facts to suggest the correct answer, and knowing that the consequences of making the wrong decision could be catastrophic. This scenario leads him to decide against making this his wish.
</li><li> The titular queen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> struggles with her newfound power. Though she genuinely seeks to be a good and fair ruler, she also struggles with the idea that she must be politically impartial, for the most part; even when it comes to people or ideas she feels very strongly about as an individual, she must be seen to be fair as queen.

When Stan returns and Mabel wins the bet (Mabel lost almost all her profits aside from 1$ repairing the damage to the shack but Stan had completely blown his winnings on the game show he was on by screwing up the final question), she gives the reins back to Stan, admitting the trouble in regards to managing the job.

Despite that, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">Numbuh 13</a> is tagged and happily proclaims he'll be Soopreme Leader, he is instantly dogpiled by many surrounding operatives so one of them would get tagged. The job may suck, but they know that it keeps the place running, and letting Numbuh 13 run it would doom them all. Unfortunately, because of this tradition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Father</a> ends up becoming Soopreme Leader briefly because he gets himself tagged in the last few seconds of the game (Father was technically a KND member due to an earlier plot led to his DNA being put into the code module for active agents). In the end, Numbuh 362, despite earlier having stepped down as Soopreme Leader specifically because of this trope, ends up taking it back from Father because she's one of the few around who can do the job well.

The people of Mewni utterly and completely refuse to do 'anything' for themselves or take responsibility for their own lives. They expect the queen to take care of their every need. Provide work and housing and food for them. The Queen has to act as though she is utterly perfect and without as much as a single flaw, regardless of how stressed or tired they are. The people are also stubbornly resistant to change, and any attempts to implement changes, even if they are for the better will either be ignored or met with hostility. When Eclipsa 'forced' reforms to be put into practice, her people either openly defied her at the best <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or tried to have her killed at the worst.</span>

Washington hated living in the limelight and the dealing with the stress of being idolized as the first President, and resented not having the time to start a family of his own. Lincoln felt suffocated by his reputation as "Honest Abe", with everyone treating him like an incorruptible symbol instead of a human being with his own darker drives, and briefly resigned from the presidency just so he could run around and indulge in being a jerk.

However, a string of completely unexpected events has left her in doubt of her abilities and her position as their leader. Her teammates are looking to her for answers more than ever, and it upsets her immensely that she doesn't know what to do anymore. At the end of the episode, she comes to the conclusion that it's up to her now to decide what she <em>wants</em> the future to be, so that she can confidently lead her team again.

<ul><li> Say what you will about modern political leaders, but many of them live their lives in a fishbowl and are ruthlessly scrutinized by the media, their political opponents, and online bloggers. Even the smallest mistakes and misstatements can blow up in one's face, particularly in the modern age when blogs, Twitter, and other online media can spread news almost immediately. Imagine if almost everything you said, every expression you made, was broadcast to the world and mercilessly picked apart across the internet and cable channels. It gets worse when you consider the level of personal venom some commentators direct at them, which in some cases would be grounds for slander or libel if made against a private citizen. And then there's what happens if your family gets dragged into it...
</li><li> Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia, suffered from this during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, when he became so overwhelmed with the task of trying to run the Russian Empire during a time of war that it took a serious toll on his physical health. As noted by biographer Robert K. Massie in his seminal book <em>Nicholas and Alexandra</em>, being deposed as the Russian Emperor actually had a fringe benefit, as it freed him from the stresses of running the country. Life in captivity wasn't exactly pleasant, and it got worse after the Bolsheviks seized power, but Nicholas' health did recover once he no longer had to put up with the headaches of running a country so huge it made up one-sixth of the world's landmass.
<ul><li> In Russia, you could notice that in Boris Yeltsin's interviews around a year after resignation he looked way better than five years prior, after the election for the second term (not even to mention a year before resignation). Removal of the strain made him look somewhat younger with time.
</li></ul></li><li> Many people who knew George VI, his wife the Queen Mother especially, have long maintained that his suddenly becoming King in the wake of the Abdication, and the stresses of leading the British through the Second World War, are what ultimately killed him at the age of 56.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1872168,00.html">Presidents of the U.S. tend to age rapidly in office.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Political diarist Alan Clarke thought that public office aged you several years for every one calendar year, and he was not even in a very important post at the time. A good visual example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>. His hair has been completely gray for so long that most people forget that when he was elected in 1992, his hair was a dark blonde. By the time his first term was up, the man had visible bags under his eyes, and his hair was completely gray.
<ul><li> A President who aged <em>before</em> taking office was arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, due to serving as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Allied Commander of the European theater</a>. The stress of leading allied forces against a well-trained military force drove Ike to drink and smoke constantly. And he took the duty seriously: A letter was found after D-Day that Eisenhower wrote in case the Normandy landings failed where he asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">to take full blame</a> (even though the landing was successful, the letter is still considered an excellent example of leadership). By the time Ike was President, he wasn't in the best of health.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Harry S Truman</a> had a sign on the oval-office desk reading "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_passing">The buck stops here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan">James Buchanan</a> left office, after failing to prevent the Civil War and seeing the division of the Union, he told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, "If you are as happy to be entering the presidency as I am to be leaving it, then you are a very happy man."
</li><li> Lincoln himself reflected on this; "Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">give him power</a>."
</li><li> During his first term in office, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GroverCleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> met a five-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in 1887 and is supposed to have said to him, "My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be President of the United States."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> was quite happy to retire after his second term of office. In a letter that he wrote to his friend Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours shortly before his departure, he stated, "Never did a prisoner released from his chains feel such relief as I shall on shaking off the shackles of power."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarrenHarding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarrenHarding">Warren Harding</a> is recorded to have said <em>I am not fit for this office and I should never have been here</em>. He also stated <em>I have no trouble with my enemies - I can take care of my enemies all right. But my damn friends... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">They're the ones that keep me walking the floors at night</a>!</em>
</li><li> Several media personalities commented on how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> seemed to suffer from his position far less than most Presidents, especially given how old he was when elected. This is probably related to him being one of the most 'hands off' presidents ever, with him largely letting his cabinet run itself (at least until the Iran-Contra Affair).
<ul><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrematurelyGreyHaired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrematurelyGreyHaired">premature aging</a> is often one of the main signs of this stress, his age at the onset might have also played a role, making the stress less visible than it might be on a younger man.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>: If you look at pictures of him before he was elected and towards the end of his presidency, it's as if he aged about 15 years in the course of eight. Lampshaded by the man himself on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> For a British example, compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> before and after his time as Prime Minister; you'd never believe he was only ten years older.
</li><li> In his book <em>Bastards and Boneheads</em>, Canadian historian Will Ferguson provides a list of quotes from the Canadian prime ministers that all pretty much say the same thing: Canada is an extremely difficult country to govern. Ferguson's book was written while Jean Chretien was in office, but one could argue that Paul Martin and Stephen Harper would add their quotes to the list if they were asked about it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> on his one-hundredth day in office: "It's a lot of work."
</li><li> It should come as no surprise that military officers in general (or at least any decent, self-respecting one) deal with this on a regular basis. Given the lives of the men under their command, logistics, the orders they give and the realities of war, they <em>have</em> to bear it. The ups and downs of rank is summed up with two complementary sayings which, in the tradition of the US military, are expressed via an acronym: RHIP. Rank Hath Its Privileges, and Rank Hath Its Problems.
