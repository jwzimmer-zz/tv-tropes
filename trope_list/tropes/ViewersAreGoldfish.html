Arguably, this is the reason why network television has historically favored episodic storytelling over more serialized ones; the idea is that the episodes can be shown out of order and that viewers can just watch episodes at random with no need for context outside of the forty-five minute block. It's a bonus if shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em> explain their setup with a handy voice-over in the opening credits.
</p><p>Sometimes a necessity in video game plots, due to the possibility of the player saving the game, taking a break of, say, two or three months, and then coming back, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain">having forgotten important plot points during that time</a>. In this case, the flashbacks will only seem insulting to the player's intelligence during a non-stop play. Some games try to avert this by putting plot summaries or scenes that otherwise show what has happened up to that point in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen">Loading Screen</a>. Others have a character keep a diary which the player can read to remind themselves of the plot so far.

Sometimes, book series will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to past events from the previous books when they were intended to be relatively standalone, or in case the viewer read the previous book, then went on to the next one a little while later. TV shows, for example, are often made around commercial breaks, so when you view it on DVD or on a channel that does not use commercials (such as the BBC) it'll seem odd.
</p><p>Often this is an excuse for lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>, to reduce production costs.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule">Fleeting Demographic Rule</a>, where executives believe that they can recycle whole plots due to this short memory, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingAd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatingAd">Repeating Ad</a>, where it's presumed viewers will not recall ads they saw in the same commercial break. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a>, where an entire episode functions as this for a series.

<ul><li> There exists a commercial for Nerf guns in which a kids "squad" is gunned down by a lone gunman. Cue action shots of the survivor getting the cool, new Nerf gun and taking out half a dozen kids to get revenge, and as our protagonist finds the one responsible, the commercial flashes back to the beginning of the thirty second commercial to remind you why he wanted revenge in the first place.
</li><li> Any of those commercials that include the phrase "act now and you'll also receive [insert product here], absolutely free!" They inevitably list all of the great bargain items you'll be getting if you act now about five times before the commercial ends. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore">But Wait, There's More!</a>
</li><li> Radio commercials that repeat phone numbers as many as four times in a row. This might have been effective in the old days, but it's almost become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a>, because now people mostly listen to the radio in situations where they can't write a number down (like driving), and the commercials that use it are always for really shady-sounding businesses (get-rich-quick schemes, predatory lenders). On the other hand, repeating the phone number means the listener is more likely to memorize it. Whether they like it or not.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in the ads where people interrupt the commercial: "Head-On, I can't stand your commercial, but your product is amazing!"
</li><li> This was also parodied when it was spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg">Disaster Movie</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> One commercial for Liberty Mutual opens with the announcer saying, "Liberty Mutual customizes your car insurance, so you only pay for what you need." The announcer goes on about how this is great news, only to be rudely interrupted by a news reporter, who proceeds to <em>repeat the exact same information</em>. The shortened version that occasionally plays on television is significantly less redundant by having the announcer only say, "Great news. Liberty Mutual customize—" before the reporter's interruption.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/BSlF6uKvsh4">Laser Optics II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a 1989 Pioneer Electronics demonstration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, ends every segment saying "Pioneer LaserDisc: It's the best show in town", and showing text saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">You are watching a Laser Disc</a>". Five segments end with "The sharpest picture, the purest sound, and the hottest entertainment to choose from". This happens after one and a half minutes at the shortest, three and a half minutes at the longest, and two minutes on average. The chapters "The Best Show in Town" and "The Hottest Entertainment" are duplicated onto side B as well. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as it was played in electronics stores with potential customers spending little time watching it.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Anime in general tends to overuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback sequences</a>, often to what happened in just the last episode, or even earlier in the very same episode
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> has an unnecessary recap at the beginning of each episode that recaps <em>the entire arc so far. In every episode.</em> Sometimes this gets so bad that the actual episode doesn't start until six minutes after the show starts. That's right. They waste a quarter of the entire time block on recap. But wait... it gets worse. In addition to that, there are also entire episodes completely devoted to flashbacking to the start of the present <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>, showing a good chunk of everything that happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em> has several recap episodes. At the end of a 13 episode arc in a complicated world, that's pretty helpful. At the end of a four episode arc, and as the last episode of the whole series, less so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> mocks the tendency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">shônen anime</a> to do this mercilessly by, after recapping the basic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widgetish premise of the series</a> in the first several episodes, Shinpachi inexplicably decides to do so once more... a hundred or so episodes later. Gintoki yells at him for it, and Shinpachi explains that viewers who've never tuned into <em>Gintama</em> before might be confused about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">what the series was smoking up till that point</a>. But 1) viewers who have never tuned into <em>Gintama</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">probably shouldn't start trying to watch the series after a hundred or so episodes</a> (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety">Commitment Anxiety</a> isn't entirely an issue), and 2) this entire scene was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">likely repeated</a> (with different dialogue) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">to save up the anime's budget once again</a>. <em>Gintama</em> pulls this trick often by having the voice actors speak over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">a still of the Yorozuya apartment</a>, oftentimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> or directly stating that they were doing so in the same scene. Though when a serious plot arc comes around, they have a tendency to pull the same stunt other shônen anime do as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> has flashback episodes every time a significant plot arc ends. Sometimes the flashbacks can take up to five episodes to finish.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> does this, having a series of flashbacks late into <em>the first episode.</em> However, this seems to be less about them assuming that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> and more about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">conserving the budget by repeating the same sequence over and over</a>. Also, a certain important sequence of events gets flashbacked every other episode for a reason, as it gradually reveals more and more of a defining moment in pasts of the characters.
</li><li> An instance of this on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> leads to a quite jarring moment when edited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a>, making it seem like Cream just ran out of a room crying <em>twice</em>! Though this was probably just bad editing around commercial breaks, rather than a recap.
</li><li> The quote at the top of the page isn't too much of an exaggeration of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> anime, with whatever happened in the last five minutes of one episode being recapped in the opening five minutes of the next, and whatever happened in the last minute before a commercial being repeated over the next twenty second after. Although the actual purpose of this is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> than anything else. Then there are the many, many flashbacks. Often to three minutes ago.
<ul><li> One of the most painful examples is the Zabuza arc where there were as many as 7 flashbacks in an episode during the final fights. Sometimes even to the episode that had just preceded it.
</li><li> Kakashi explained what the Sharingan does and how it works, and repeats it later on in the fight.
</li><li> Including, in all seriousness, an exact replica of the page quote. Let me restate that: <em>They had a flashback to something that happened seconds before.</em>
</li><li> This happens less often in <em>Shippuden</em>, though, although the Sasuke and Sai arc frequently reminded viewers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasori's last words</span> gave Sakura a tip on where to find one of his spies among Orochimaru's followers. The manga does this from time to time, although often as a way of illustrating what characters are thinking about.
</li><li> Actually works quite well after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itach's death. Having a montage of all the good things he's done and finishing with a crying Sasuke (who up until that point, we haven't seen cry outside of a flashback of when he was a child) made a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a></span>. Even if these same flashbacks were repeated numerous times.
<ul><li> Can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> if it happens between manga chapters, which are published once a week before being collected in volumes, though within a chapter it gets a little boring.
</li><li> Additionally, it can also be used as a way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">showing</a> what is on characters' minds, especially when they're reflecting on something, such as when Kakashi realizes he should go to help Obito save Rin in "Kakashi Gaiden", recalling some of the points Obito and the Fourth Hokage made regarding the rules.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is bad for it. Really noticeable post-Time Skip where there is a series recap, opening theme, and then previous episode recap which totals up to about 6 minutes of times, this is because the Anime decides to adapt one chapter per episode and therefore there is more need to pad the episode. In the Dressrosa arc, many flashbacks are done multiple times times, albeit sometimes with minor details added as the story progressed... although it was possible to get the entire gist of the flashback the first time. Also in the same arc is the constant reminder of background stuff happening, cue shots of scenery or background characters giving exposition. Skipping all of that leaves you with approximately 8-10 mins of episode left.
</li><li> Just over halfway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV">Street Fighter II V</a></em>, Bison has Ken sedated and gets into a fight with Chun Li, ending with him suffocating her. Ken was apparently conscious enough to witness this, because for the next four episodes, he does nothing but have flashbacks of that fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> this during the Pegasus Versus Kaiba duel, where Pegasus started to ramble off the effect of his card (Cost Down) — only for Kaiba to butt in and say that he already knows what the card does (though while this would normally be a subversion, Kaiba goes on to give a Cliffs Notes version of the effect, thus making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> instead).
</li><li> Even though you really only need to see one duel to know what Pot Of Greed does, they <em>still</em> go through the trouble of saying "I play the Magic Card Pot Of Greed, which allows me to draw two cards from my deck" almost every time the card is played. To be fair, the rules of the actual game states that you must speak out loud every single one of your actions so your opponent knows what the hell you're doing — although most players just say "I play X card" and only explain the effect when asked. Then again, real cards also state their effects on them, which at the very least is more than can be said for the card images used in the dub.
<ul><li> Mocked to hell and back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em> where multiple characters insist no one knows what Pot of Greed does.
</li></ul></li><li> The volume forms of the manga can be pretty bad about this. While it would make sense to recap the last climactic action in one-chapter-a-week form, when you read them straight, it turns into:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I play my trap card!" <br/><em>(Next chapter starts)</em> <br/>"I play my trap card!"
</div><ul><li> That's fairly standard with most chapter-based manga, really. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Lunar Legend Tsukihime</a></em> do the same thing. This is easily explained. Mangas often run in a serial with multiple series, such as Shonen Jump, before they are collected into a volume containing a single series. Serials are normally released monthly format, and thus when a new chapter comes out, it's much easier on the reader to have a quick refresher on something they read a month ago, sometimes more, then it is for them to have to look up last month's issue to remember what happened last time.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> did the same thing in the Battle City arc, with Marik explaining <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Those fools don't realize I am Marik!"</span> in an internal monologue. At least three times an episode.
</li><li> Also, in the duels against Arkana and Umbra &amp; Lumis, said characters had to add at least once per commercial break that whoever lost would be sent to the Shadow Realm thanks to the spiritual saws/glass. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">4Kids really wanted to make its point...</a>
</li><li> The multi-episodes duels are also pretty amusing when it comes to this. The episodes always start with a slow (usually dialogue-free) pan-up of the battlefield, showing the amount of Life Points and etc. that each player has; then the cheerleading squad go to thoroughly explain the situation and telling on how bad it is for [insert good guy who's dueling here]. Then [insert good guy who's dueling here] will have an internal monologue reflecting about his situation in detail; after this going-through-the-duel-three-times routine, the episode goes on. The dub actually goes one step beyond — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillingTheSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillingTheSilence">dialogue is added in the slow pan-up</a> to explain the game, then the cheerleading squad explains it again, and the monologue (usually more talky than the original one) explains it a third time. Whew.
</li><li> There are also a <em>lot</em> of flashbacks to major events that already happened; due to the duels taking up so much time in an episode with not tons happening, there's sometimes more flashbacks than plot.
</li><li> In Yugi (or rather Yami's) duel with Weevil during the Doma arc, there's a flashback to a scene that happened <strong>less then two minutes ago.</strong> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xum2z3zI8o4">The time between is only 2:47 to 4:13.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Roughly every fifth episode begins by recapping both what's currently happening and the backstory for most of the characters involved.
</li><li> If you watch all the episodes all in one go, you get very tired of hearing the story of how Kikyo and Inu-Yasha died... especially since they replay Inu-Yasha's death scene <em>every single episode</em>.
</li><li> In some episodes, the second half of the episode consists largely of flashbacks to the <em>first half of the same episode</em>.
</li><li> Also, from about the third season on, every time a character appears on screen for the first time in an episode, a subtitle shows up telling us their name. This appears even if it's someone who is in every episode, or of their name was just spoken in dialog.
</li></ul></li><li> Like many other animes, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiGun">Samurai Gun</a></em>, the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> split each episode in half for their single commercial break. As a result, immediately after the second half's eyecatch, the episode would replay the last scene of the first half. How jarring this was varied between episodes — the episode "Cool Runnings! The Race of the Snowmen" was particularly jarring, repeating as it did a minute-long sequence of Cologne mocking Ranma for being foolish enough to challenge her, and Ranma's defiant retort. It also makes you sit through them telling you the plot of the show every time, starting on the second season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> did the same thing, sometimes making the repeat trivially different.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection">Princess Resurrection</a></em> did a few same episode flashbacks, the most extreme case being episode 8 where they did a flashback to a scene that happened 51 seconds ago. (About 2 to 5 minutes ago for the characters.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em>. "There is only one future. Only one future. Two Kamui's, one future. You are Kamui, but there are two Kamui's. Two Kamui's. You and he are Kamui."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> The anime sometimes had this with commercial breaks, but it was more stark when an episode would start by spending at least a couple of minutes repeating what happened in the last episode. Made a little strange and amusing by the fact that the repeat could sometimes be <em>very</em> different than what happened previously. One explanation offered for this was the series changing animation directors often... a new director would show up, decide he wanted someone to emote differently, be positioned differently, or say something different from what the last guy did, and thus essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> the last few minutes of the previous episode so as to do it his way.
</li><li> This was also stacked on top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">the recaps at the start of every episode</a>, which just ends up hilarious as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert">the narrator</a> always begin with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Last Time, On Dragon Ball Z</a>!"
</li><li> The Portuguese dub was (in)famous because, among many things, they didn't replay the dub they already did in the previous episode when they recapped it, they would re-dub it and, more often than not, change the dialogue completely. Usually they would do a serious version in the original, and a gag dub in the recap. Such as a character replying to a death threat with anger in the first case, and in the recap replying with a laugh and a "Impossible. There are 60 more episodes after this!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> is a notoriously frequent offender, in the anime format at least (not in the manga, or at least, not enough to be particularly noticeable). How many times did Tamahome rip up that damn love letter?
</li><li> Lampshaded in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers">Nerima Daikon Brothers</a></em>, with the scene from before the commercial repeating almost immediately after, and one character commenting, "We already said these lines."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Like the other Shônen examples above, done incessantly with this anime, to the point where almost five minutes (out of a 20-minute episode) can be the last moments of the previous episode.
</li><li> And a fair bit of what is left will be flashbacks to things that happened an only an episode ago, or repeated reaction shots of people commenting on events without adding anything new. The padding is ruthless and can make watchers realise the filler wasn't so bad after all.
</li><li> In later seasons, they start flashing back to earlier parts of the same episode. Not just action scenes where someone realizes how his opponent's attacks function, but also normal conversations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> has the next chapter start off with a slightly abridged version of the last few pages of the previous chapter. This was probably a good thing while being published in serial format but utterly annoying and pointless in the collected volumes. This doesn't just happen in the start of a volume, so the recap is often to something <em>one</em> page away.
</li><li> Many manga translations include footnotes with translations of posters, flags and the like. That's fine. Sometimes they only translate it once (be it the first appearance or in special notes at the end of the volume), but sometimes they translate it more than once. That might be alright if the last note was 100 pages away. However, some translators (Such as Glénat) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever">put notes EVERY time said poster/flag/whatever pops up</a>, <strong>even if they're on facing pages</strong>. So you see the footnote, look at the left page, and see the <em>exact same note</em>.
<ul><li> This convention was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja">The Adventures of Dr. McNinja</a></em> where a character uses the Spanish word for Police (in an otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish">English conversation</a>) four times, and each time is accompanied by a footnote on the English translation, so by the end, there are four separate footnotes all reading "Police" resting at the bottom of the page.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> gets ridiculous with flashbacks and previous episode recaps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno">Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~</a></em>, a 26-episode series, has not one but TWO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">recap episodes</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime, especially as of the <em>Best Wishes!</em> series, and particularly with Ash, who cannot seem to stop flashing back to previous episodes or even incidents that happened earlier in the episode. The "Who's that Pokemon?" segments, particularly in the first season and Black and White seasons. 99% of the time, the silhouetted Pokemon will be of the Pokemon that appeared in the episode, as opposed to one chosen at random. You would <strong>really</strong> have to not be paying attention to get it wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> is horribly, blatantly guilty of this, with six episodes dedicated entirely to recapping the series and its prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, and constant flashbacks to events that everyone knows have already taken place — most notably the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Uzumi Nara Athha</span>, which happens almost every time Cagalli is on screen. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, <em>SEED</em>'s Crowning Moment of Flashback is the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicol Amalfi</span>, which gets <em>at least</em> one flashback every episode after it happens for the rest of the series. It even pops up a couple of times in <em>Destiny</em> despite being set two years later and not being remotely as relevant.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">SEED</a></em> itself is really no better, and first earned director Fukuda his derisive "Flashback 'Em All" moniker from the fandom. There are flashbacks within nearly every episode, sometimes to things that have happened as recently as the last episode. In SEED's case it sometimes works quite well as a dramatic and sad device. Sometimes it's just cheap and annoying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaNoPrincesama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaNoPrincesama">Uta no Prince-sama</a> - Maji Love 1000%</em> gets really bad about this starting in episode seven; almost all the flashbacks are to material earlier in the episode, and in several cases the scene happened less than two minutes prior to the flashback!
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChargemanKen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChargemanKen">Chargeman Ken!</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsoaHMOp5uM&amp;feature=related#t=01m26s">flashes back to an event<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which occurred <em>thirty seconds</em> before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em> has one episode during Kenichi's fight with Takeda where probably half of the entire thing is just a recap, though it could just be said that the last part of the last episode was just repeated exactly.
</li><li> Almost every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> starts with a recap of pretty major plot points that you can't possibly not know unless you haven't watched any previous episodes at all ("Have we mentioned that Britannia is a big evil empire that took over Japan and that Lelouch is trying to defeat it with his mind-controlling eye thingy? Yes, but only, like, twenty times? Well, let's go over it again, in exhaustive detail!") and often re-mentions some recent events from the previous couple of episodes, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> has a lengthy recap sequence at the beginning of most episodes, and an entire episode halfway through the first 26-episode season dedicated to recap. Factoring in the large amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> in the first half, the show ended up wasting an awful lot of screentime.
</li><li> If you watch any given episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em>, you'll quickly cotton on to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Racer X IS Speed's brother!</a> Given that the narration excitedly reveals this plot point every single chance it gets, it's impossible not to know this within minutes of watching.
</li><li> In the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>'s second season, every single episode reintroduces every character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles">Boss Subtitles</a> stating their names and Quirks, because in the span of a week between each episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">anyone would forget every single character's name</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako">Shirobako</a></em> frequently uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles">Boss Subtitles</a> to remind people of MusAni employees' names and titles. Granted, it's partly because the majority of the cast comes in at the very beginning, and some of those subtitles introduce the names and titles to the viewer for the first time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters">Duel Masters</a></em> parodies this trope with one character explaining how at the start of a duel, both players have to build up mana, only for another to state that by episode thirteen, everyone knows already.
</li><li> In some mangas, the start of the second chapter and/or volume will recap the premise of the series. It can be helpful for first-time readers who are reading it in the magazine, but it can be obnoxious for people who are binging the series.
</li><li> In the last episode of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, the student council takes turns pumping air into a balloon, with the one who pops it losing. Kaguya offers Fujiwara some tangerines during the latter's turn, so the narrator mentions that tangerines contain limonene, which dissolves rubber (making it an obvious ploy to get Fujiwara to pop the balloon). Fujiwara initially refuses, but decides to eat a tangerine minutes later, resulting in the narrator reminding the viewers about what limonene does before the balloon bursts.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> will actually do this, including a recap to the first part of a story... that's in the same book, and was simply broken up by a few gag panel pages. Also present is in just how often the comics reuse the exact same jokes, not simply from issue to issue, or within the same issue, but in at least one case having jokes with identical punchlines in two short comics <em>on the same page</em>. Because obviously reading three more panels was sufficient time for that joke to become funny again.

Therefore, it was required that every character be identified by name (usually in a bold font) and their powers briefly described.

Richie eventually asks Mr. Rich himself, who tells his son that he'll think it over.

When the villain is explaining how he carried off his evil plan, he fully recaps the entire story, up to the moment right before he started his flashback. This wouldn't be so bad if the whole thing had been simple narration, but the filmmakers felt compelled to augment the character's narration with clips of the scenes in question, including those of scenes <em>that had just taken place</em>.

</li><li> The makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThereWillBeBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThereWillBeBlood">There Will Be Blood</a></em> apparently assumed that viewers would not remember that Daniel Plainview's plan was to cut a deal with Union Oil and lay a pipeline to the coast so that he would no longer have to pay rail-tanker fees to Standard Oil unless this fairly simple plan were explained again and again every five minutes or so for the entire length of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurboAPowerRangersMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurboAPowerRangersMovie">Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie</a></em> was really bad about this.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>, the eponymous superhero tracks his uncle's killer to an abandoned warehouse, and confronts the shooter. We see the shooter's face, and the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashes back</a> to show Spider-Man stepping out of the same criminal's way and letting him escape, which led to Uncle Ben getting shot. Apparently, someone was worried that we wouldn't remember what the guy looked like, despite the fact that the scene in the flashback occurred less than five minutes ago (though it was slightly altered to help the viewer see it from Peter's point of view when he realizes the absolute magnitude of that "Thanks!"). The reboot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> is also guilty of this.
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> features several cutaways to a pair of sewage technicians who have realized the villain's plan and then keep repeating it over and over.
</li><li> Every scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> involving Al Powell and Dwayne T. Robinson is to simply remind audiences that, yes, Al is still the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> on the force who believes John McClane is the only hope the hostages have and Robinson is still this movie's example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Police Are Useless</a> by refusing to listen. And there are <strong>several</strong> scenes with the two discussing the exact same thing, which is the main reason Robinson is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>; it's enough for him to be an pain-in-the-ass obstructionist, but he has to keep <em>hammering it home</em> in his every scene, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> singled Robinson out as the only thing he didn't enjoy about the film.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineDead">Nine Dead</a></em> does use occasional flashbacks to earlier lines of dialogue when the characters figure something out, two flashbacks to dialogue from the captor appear no less than five minutes after he actually says them.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that many of these old stories — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Arthurian legends</a>, and so on — were originally sung ballads from the days when few could read or write, and the repetition helped the person singing the ballad (and the listener, because some of these could be pretty long) remember what happened.
</li><li> In addition, the ballad needed to grab and hold the attention of folk who had come in late, or nipped off for refreshments, and who might have no idea what was happening if not for the repetition.
</li></ul></li><li> Each and every one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em> books would spend an entire chapter (usually the second one) giving a rundown of all the main characters and how the club worked. The <em>Baby-Sitter's Little Sister</em> spin-off series did the same thing, with Karen having to explain her "two-two" blended families in every single book.
<ul><li> What makes the trope apply notably to this series is not so much that there's a recap, it's that it's done in such <em>excruciating detail</em> that it's like the author is explaining everything from scratch. While it's common for most series to remind us of things, with the BSC it's stated like it's the first time, every time. This is most likely because plots rarely continue from one book to another, so the books don't need to be read in any particular order to be understood. This means that any book in the series could be the first one a new reader reads, so they have to describe the characters' personalities, backgrounds, relationships, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> This seems quite normal for most book series, as the new books sometimes come after months, if not years. It's just really glaring if you read the books within a few weeks; for example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt">Drizzt Do'Urden</a> novels are notorious for it. Also in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen">War of the Spider Queen</a></em> hexalogy which was writen by six different authors under the supervision of seventh one (who wrote the Drizzt novels). One of these books used this even inside itself, sometimes within the same chapter, to the point where it got annoying.
</li><li> It's just not possible to find a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em> book that doesn't mention certain information repeatedly — the twins are blonde and blue-eyed, with perfect size-six figures and identical gold lavalieres that their parents gave them on their 16th birthday; they drive a Spider Fiat; their house has a Spanish-style kitchen; their mother is often mistaken for their older sister, and their brother looks like a younger version of their father. Considering how many books there are in this series, it borders on the ridiculous.
</li><li> Same goes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a></em>. The same little bits of backstory are repeated endlessly (Nancy's mother died when she was three; Bess and George are cousins, yet polar opposites; Frank is one year older, one inch taller, and slightly leaner than his brother Joe.)
</li><li> Haruki Murakami's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneQEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneQEightyFour">1Q84</a></em> is really terrible with this. Have you forgotten what Tengo's ears look like or did you just zone out and not even absorb any of the last ten pages? Don't worry, another summary is coming right up.
</li><li> The book series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> also does this, explaining at the beginning of each book how the girls are the guardians of Candracar, have magic elemental powers, etc. It wouldn't be so bad, except its possible to whip through several books in one day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> is notorious for this - almost every time Edward comes up, his looks get described <em>in full</em>.

</li><li> The two pages in the first chapter of any given <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> book will be a recap of the first book.
</li><li> Along with its slide from hard to soft alternate history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline-191</a> restates characteristics of numerous characters every time they appear. US Navy sailor Sam Carsten is perhaps the most notorious, with every segment where he's the POV character starting with extensive detail about the current status of his sunburn or describing that he can burn even when the sun isn't out.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. At some point early on in each of the first five books, Harry tells the audience that, yes, he really is a bona-fide wizard, followed by a very brief description of the magical world and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraStrengthMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraStrengthMasquerade">Extra-Strength Masquerade</a>. Thankfully dropped from <em>Blood Rites</em> on.
</li><li> On the subject of wizards named Harry, the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books were pretty bad about this. Rowling liked to remind readers of pretty much anything important that happened in earlier books. Even things like mentioning that Harry is going to school to become a wizard. Arguably the most awkward example was when one of Harry's textbooks reminded him of what a Muggle is. By the fourth book, this had tapered down, and it stopped completely around the fifth book.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em>, some concepts are hammered in three or four times just in case they didn't sink in the first time.

<ul><li> Watching a TV series on a streaming platform or on DVD often makes this occur inadvertently, as a piece of action will occur before a commercial break would appear during a TV airing and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdBreakDoubleTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdBreakDoubleTake">occur again a moment later to bring the viewers back into the action after the non-existent-on-the-DVD commercial break.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> segments are made of this trope when watching a show on DVD or streaming.
</li><li> In general, this seems to lead to changes in backstories, characters' families, etc. The execs and writers seem to think fans won't recall small references or brief, seemingly throwaway lines from several seasons back. Then something pops up changed, and the fans go: "But that's not how they said it was before!"
</li><li> Sports broadcasts. When they aren't pointing out the obvious, they are telling you what <em>just</em> happened a few minutes ago, showing you in slow motion, too.
</li><li> Often occurs in American shows broadcast in the UK. The public-funded BBC channels don't have any advert breaks at all, and British commercial TV stations don't have as many advert breaks as their US counterparts so the breaks they get don't always match up properly with the points the program-makers were intending breaks to take place.
</li><li> Repetition is very common in hour-long documentaries that would otherwise be a half- or quarter-hour. Redundancy helps to fill the hour, because such shows tend to be about subjects that really can be explained in a quarter- or half-hour, and they need filler material in order to fill the entire hour. Most American documentaries are completely unwatchable due to the constant recapping of the first three minutes, which also leaves little time to impart any actual information. It gets even more ridiculous when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s <em>own</em> programs do this, and the obvious implication that they're doing it for the benefit of whichever commercial network ends up buying it can be almost insulting at times. Especially when they show you the same recap/coming soon segment twice in quick succession, either side of the non-existent ad break. A beautifully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted Trope</a>, thankfully, in Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough">David Attenborough</a>'s documentaries - because he doesn't go in for repetition and assumes we can remember what he last said, he imparts more information in five minutes than most documentaries do in the full hour.

</li><li> Fly-on-the-wall/embedded-camera-crew "Reality" shows may be based around three or four incidents in an episode. Because the entire audience has profound ADHD, the incidents are chopped into one-minute slices that are interleaved; say, one slice per incident then go to an ad break. Needless to say, each time attention returns to an incident it's important to recap what happened during the previous slice...

It's particularly annoying for British viewers, because the advert breaks are arranged differently — a reminder of something that happened ten minutes ago on the show when it is shown in the U.S. may have happened two minutes ago for British viewers. The sepia tone, as though they're showing something that happened in the 1920s and not, like, five minutes ago is what really makes it classic on ANTM.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>: A show praised for being one of the most intelligent on television, succumbed to this later in its run, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the higher-ups complaining</a> the plot was too convoluted for people to follow. So, generally, in the last season the first half-minute after the commercial break is devoted to the narrator summarizing everything else to happen in that episode at speeds that would make the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> narrator blush.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AustinAndAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AustinAndAlly">Austin &amp; Ally</a></em>: In the double-length episode "Chapters and Choices".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> segments are included in the DVD versions. This gets annoying as you re-watch a scene you just saw, then bizarre as they show scenes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">never happened before.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>: This show in season 4 injected some jarring recaps <em>halfway through each episode</em>, which were designed to tell viewers what unfolded merely half and hour ago. Even if, say, a viewer jumped in at that point from watching another program, it still seems stupid, simply because <em>Bones</em> does not take much effort to follow (like any procedural crime drama).
</li><li> <em>Conmen Case Files</em>: This show is horrible about this, at least judging from the "Nick Gage" episode. At least 75% of the running time is taken by the narrator endlessly repeating that Nick Gage is, in fact, a conman, and that he has, in fact, conned people, and that these people have lost money. To this conman. Who conned them. For their money. That were conned away. By Nick Gage the conman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>:
<ul><li> Does this all the time. First you see the crime scene, then they talk about the evidence, then they process it in the lab and remember collecting it, then they talk about why it matters and when someone has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>, they show you which specific piece of evidence was important.
</li><li> One Season 3 episode has a bad example where it constantly goes to a Mitochondrial DNA Lab in Norfolk, Virginia. You know this because every time it switches there, they felt the need to have a location stamp with that information. The scenes aren't even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">that important!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior">Deadliest Warrior</a></em>: This Spike TV show has a major case of this. After every single part of the analysis of the "warriors", there's a recap of the whole episode up to that point. Then again, the show isn't particularly intellectually challenging in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em>: At least half of the first season started off with a long flashback explaining everything that happened in the first episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>: Practically every show on this network nowadays feels the need to have the show's logo appear in the bottom right corner of the screen after they return from commercial break. 'Cause, you know, we somehow didn't see the "We're back" bumper telling us which show this was. Though that's really more there for if people are recording the show. It's just as annoying, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> did this in its series 8 premiere. When Clara is trapped among the cyborgs, she recalls the Doctor's words from literally just a few minutes ago: "They're not breathing...how long can you hold your breath?" in order to let viewers know why she suddenly takes a deep breath and holds it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009">FlashForward (2009)</a></em> has repeated Mark and Olivia Benford's flashforward at least once per episode, more or less beating the viewer over the head with reminders that he's drinking and she's cheating. Word is that viewers might have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> to thank for this. Unsurprisingly, the more popular storylines tend to involve characters whose flashforward was only shown once, or who didn't have one at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostHunters">Ghost Hunters</a></em>: Okay, so imagine this: The TAPS crew are making their way through a room in an old movie theater that's reportedly haunted. They move across the stage when they hear a loud clatter. They scream, panic, and enter a title splash screen. Moments later, one of them appears and describes <em>exactly</em> what we just saw about thirty seconds ago. To make sure you did not forget the events of thirty seconds ago, there's a scene where the others catch up with the persons in questions who are stammering out what they were doing at the time of the noise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlCode">Girl Code</a></em>: Between the opening that shows clips from throughout the show, commercial breaks that show multiple talking heads before each break, and a recap at the end of each episode, about half of each episode is shown twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>: Has done this before, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued">To Be Continued</a> hour-long specials such as "Jakey Breaky Heart" and "Should I Neigh or Should I Go?" Justifiable, however, in one regular episode, because it was from the second or third season, and Miley was having a flashback from the beginning of the first season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>: Many episodes begin by repeating part of the last scene of the previous episode. Sometimes this gives you the impression the continuity editor is a goldfish; in one instance, Claire woke up and declared "Holy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseCutShort">shi</a>—" as the credits rolled, but in the next episode, where the scene continued, she instead said "Oh my God". This is not a great instance of thinking ahead, guys.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em>: "The Duel" (aka "The Even Chance") of this mini-series has a minor example from the script, as the writing had its hits and misses. Archie Kennedy is constantly shown as Horatio's particular friend among the midshipmen. It's a first episode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a> didn't achieve the highest numbers as in subsequent parts, but it clearly established that Archie Kennedy and Horatio are friends. Archie's lost during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty">Boarding Party</a> because the villain of the story untied the boat he was in. When Horatio and said villain duel to death, Jack boasts that he's gonna kill him, just as he killed his little pal Archie. Horatio just wrinkles his forehead, asking: "Kennedy?" Instead of being angry or demanding that they arrest him for confessing to murder. Hornblower and writers, we remember Archie!
</li><li> Lampshaded in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing">Jason King</a></em>. King is pitching his TV adaptation to an American network executive, who insists that he repeat an exposition scene (with the plot discussed by the heroes, then the villains) in case the audience didn't get it the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em>: Every episode has a flashback near the end revealing how they pulled off the job by showing a key event that was left out previously (for instance, that when she borrowed his coat, she planted a camera on it). Since these are necessarily framed by repeating the events immediately before and after (her taking the coat and giving it back), they work very poorly if the key event only took place five minutes ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> Has this in spades. For one example, consider Eloise Hawking: brought up briefly in one episode two seasons before she actually became important. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> segments showed clips from that episode in the one she reappeared in.
</li><li> The extended episodes have annoying side comments pop-up every ten seconds, bringing up mostly obvious details. While it's sometimes useful for fans who forgot a few subtle details over the long breaks, the comments are mostly incessant chatter...and that's before they start mentioning the nicknames shippers made for the Jack-Kate or Sawyer-Kate couplings.
</li><li> When ABC wanted to build hype on season 4 after a <em>very</em> long eight month break, the executives went overboard with jogging viewers' memories. A <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestWeekEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestWeekEver">Best Week Ever</a> comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded this</a>: "So I first watched the re-airing of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> season 3 finale. And then I watched a season 3 re-cap of everything I just watched. And <em>then</em> I happened to see a re-cap of the re-cap before the season 4 opening episode. Altogether, I got to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Charlie drown</span> three times!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaddigansQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaddigansQuest">Maddigan's Quest</a></em>: After "Newton", the flashbacks at the opening to each episode repeatedly reminded us that yes, the Fantasia had in fact managed to get hold of the solar converter. Apparently the fact that most of the cast was spending most of their time running around either trying to steal or protect the thing wasn't enough to keep it in our minds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef">MasterChef</a></em>: Repeats almost exactly what happened in the previous 20 seconds after every commercial break, leading to an episode that counted down the seconds remaining for the Pressure Test twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium">Medium</a></em>: Always done: Whenever Allison has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">ding ding ding! moment</a>, we get a flashback to earlier in the episode so the show can reinforce the connection she's making — even if it just happened 20 minutes ago.
</li><li> <em>Moment of Truth</em>: This game show suffered from this. Every time they came back from commercial break, they would recap half of the embarrassing questions asked of a contestant already. They would also show extended Coming Up Next segments, recap previous shows, and show clips of upcoming shows in commercials. This resulted in 75% of the show being scenes you've seen FIVE TIMES ALREADY.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tends to be an offender whenever they don't have enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationThroughPyrotechnics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationThroughPyrotechnics">TNT</a>... uh, material to fill an hour. Segments are usually started by a recap of what happened five minutes ago and ended by a preview of what's coming up next, making about a third of the whole show pure repetition. Granted, it does mean you can tune in at almost any time and not miss a beat, but it also makes the show exceedingly hard to watch on a streaming service. It got especially bad in later seasons, as there began to be fewer myths per episode and therefore more padding was needed to fill out the episode.
</li><li> This from the very show that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters">debunked the myth of goldfish only having a three-second memory</a>. OK, so Adam's tank had about a three-second <em>lifespan</em>....
</li><li> The BBC edited <em>MythBusters</em> down to 30 minutes when they showed it on their own channels in the UK. (Though the versions shown on the "Quest" channel are a full hour).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>:
<ul><li> Loves to do this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> in their game shows:
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal">Deal or No Deal</a></em> triple-dips in this trope, starting off every episode with a flashback to the previous one, then stopping midway through to recap. Plus each contestant usually has some kind of sob story or noble intention for their winnings, which Howie Mandel will usually point towards the beginning and then harp on incessantly throughout the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MinuteToWinIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MinuteToWinIt">Minute to Win It</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, especially in earlier episodes. First, just like <em>Deal or No Deal</em>, each contestant always has some kind of sob story to tell, which is usually showcased early in the episode. Then the show will usually proceed to incessantly derail itself between games and after commercial breaks to remind the viewers of it at every opportunity possible. And with each game, after the Blueprint video explains the game, Guy Fieri will sometimes recap the rules between the Blueprint and the game, or in a voice-over during the game (although they've gotten better about this variant lately), depending on how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> they need to achieve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger">Commercial Break Cliffhanger</a>. If there's a commercial break before the game ends (and there frequently is), expect another recap after the break. NBC apparently not only think viewers are goldfish, but goldfish with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!</a>
</li><li> The series premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosStillStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosStillStanding">Who's Still Standing?</a></em> would cut away after <em>every single round</em> to a graphic with a voice-over (which was obviously clumsily added in post-production) to spend 30 seconds recapping the state of the game. This became even more ridiculous whenever it happened immediately before or after host Ben Bailey did a perfectly good in-studio summary of the same information in only 10 seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> has a habit of having one of the characters conspicuously summarize the plot, right after the half-way point of the show. It seems like DiNozzo got the job more often than others, but McGee gets it a lot, too. They're usually talking to Gibbs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad">Police Squad!</a></em>: This was the infamous reason this show was cancelled — the head of the ABC network thought viewers wouldn't be able to pay attention well enough to get it. It has since become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></em>: Does this...not infrequently. Sometimes it seems like a mood-building piece: showing the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Alice learned that Bob had a girlfriend</a>" scene as a short flashback, instead of merely recapping it, slowed the action down and caught the emotion better, perhaps. But it's still annoying, especially when we get to see the same "Alice remembers Carol being extremely rude to her that one time, and <em>that's</em> why they're still on edge around each other, did you forget?" scene in four episodes in a row.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em>: Uses a variation with it's "clue-vision", zooming in and then HIGHLIGHTING the clue Shawn just noticed (or flashing back on a line of dialogue or flashing back and again HIGHLIGHTING a clue as it is noticed). ALWAYS accompanied by Shawn making his squinty-eyed-I-just-found-a-clue-face (Lampshaded as such eventually when Gus points out that, yes, he also saw many of the same clues but never feel the need to make a silly face).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a>: Try to watch an episode of any show that this man is involved with (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a></em>), and know in your heart that half of the show is recapping what just happened. Worst of all is the "Kitchen Nightmares revisited" episodes, where they go back to restaurants from earlier seasons: Ten minutes of old episode footage/recapping, two of Gordon Ramsay actually revisiting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution">Revolution</a></em>: Averted Trope. Apart from the standard Previously On segments occurring at the beginning of each episode after the pilot, it assumes that viewers have a long-term memory, in the sense that it doesn't repeat flashbacks more than once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>:
<ul><li> Done as a joke later on; J.D. is reminded of incidents that are not perceived as manly. The last flashback is him ordering an Appletini, which happened about fifteen seconds ago.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>: Played in the above-referenced manner of using this to get away with blatant retcons. Early season plots are dropped and forgotten without ever being addressed, such as the fact Jor-El had seemingly sent Clark to <em>conquer</em> Earth; later when Brainiac tries to gaslight Clark by claiming Jor-El was a dictator, Clark acts with disbelief, forgetting that until this point he <em>thought</em> Jor-El was evil. Likewise, the show would sometimes try to slip in new wrinkles in the backstory, such as the introduction of Veritas, which cannot fit at all with previously established events, but figured that fans just wouldn't remember (making things very awkward when binge-watching the boxset). On a smaller scale, this would even apply in-between episodes, where they would often set up for a cliffhanger of Clark having royally pissed off Lana, Chloe, Lex, or anyone not involved in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, in such a way it seems this is setting up for long-term hostilities, but its instead all completely forgotten about later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sportscenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sportscenter">Sportscenter</a></em>: Very frequently, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> show will begin with a recap of the sporting event that the network just televised.
</li><li> Frequently occurs within one episode throughout the earlier days of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise, where an ad break will be followed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainsLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainsLog">Captain's Log</a> explaining what just happened before the break.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>: Parodied in the 1975 musical TV special <em>It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman</em>, where Doctor Sedgwick sings a song about how his sole motivation is to get revenge on Superman and Switzerland (for turning him down for the Nobel Prize 10 times). It then cuts out midverse and promises that after the commercial it will reveal what terrible thing the doctor wants to do before he dies, as though everyone just missed or forgot him singing a song about how he wants revenge. And tells everyone to stay tuned for Chapter 4: Sedgwick's Revenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a></em>: After the "watching the screen on one of the Teletubbies' stomachs" segment, the Teletubbies always shouted "Again, again again!" The creators invariably bowed to their wishes. Explainable (and arguably justifiable) by the intended target audience being <em>under two years old</em>; some of the research the show was based on suggests the only thing its viewers are expected to take away from it is a vague lifelong sense of familiarity with some of the advertisers' logos.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TruCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TruCalling">Tru Calling</a></em> often had flashbacks during the second half of the episode to events from the first half. Probably done because, for much of its run, the show's first half hour aired at the same time as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable">Unforgettable</a></em>: The whole premise of this CBS police procedural is that the main character <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">remembers everything</a></strong>. Evidently, they don't trust their viewers to remember this one-sentence premise, because <em>every single commercial for the show</em> has to remind them of this fact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>: Does a great deal of this, though it is somewhat justified in that its large cast means that characters will fade in and out of view with irritating regularity, leading casual viewers to be reminded of their existence. Add to that that the plot is often so thick with so many sub-plots and red herrings crossing each other that the plot can get very confusing at times. On the other hand, the overly long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> sequences that occur in every single episode except the first make this trope laughable when marathoning the show on DVD, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> will remind viewers of plot points brought up a single episode ago. This is especially true when it reminds you of the ending of the previous episode, which you just saw. This is especially infuriating when the same clip is used over and over to remind you of a single plot point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB">The WB</a>: This dying network came with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> stunt that recapped the first half-hour of hourly shows, apparently for the benefit of viewers who were watching other channels for the previous half-hour. Programs subjected to this included <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>: The first episode features a flashback in its final scene to remind us who the newly discovered dead body is, in a show that typically eschewed any such artificial storytelling techniques. David Simon didn't want to do it but HBO insisted, and it actually is justified: the episode introduces the viewer to so many characters and situations that odds are they actually will have forgotten the dead character, who only appeared briefly in an early scene.

</li><li> E.C. Segar's original <em>Thimble Theater</em> strip, whence Popeye first came, constantly recapped the plot in the first panel during long storylines for those who weren't caught up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy">Dick Tracy</a></em> spends every Sunday rehashing the previous week's action. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/TheComicsCurmudgeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/TheComicsCurmudgeon">The Comics Curmudgeon</a> once congratulated <em>Dick Tracy</em> for going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with its recaps; it spent so long in one strip rehashing what happened yesterday that it ended with the plot <em>less advanced</em> than it had been the day before!
</li><li> It seems that most newspaper comics that follow a storyline do this a lot. Other offenders are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/RexMorganMD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/RexMorganMD">Rex Morgan, M.D.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MaryWorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MaryWorth">Mary Worth</a></em>, and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>, all of which spent about two panels actually getting something new done and the rest recapping. Justified somewhat when you realize that many of the newspapers that carry <em>Dick Tracy</em>, <em>Rex Morgan</em>, etc., only carry it in their larger Sunday comics section — the much smaller weekday comics section may not have room for it, therefore the writers create the Sunday episodes so they can be readable without the weekday episodes being available.
</li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleOrphanAnnie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleOrphanAnnie">Little Orphan Annie</a></em> is a repeat offender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Buckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Buckles">Buckles</a></em>, every character addresses every other character by name at least once in every strip, as if readers are likely to forget who's who on a day to day basis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MallardFillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MallardFillmore">Mallard Fillmore</a></em> has very little in terms of actual plot, and yet still manages to abuse this trope by having the first panel recap whatever issue is annoying him this week.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> does multi-day storylines, it will often have either a caption explaining the premise that previous comics have set up or a character explaining what happened in the previous comics in the first panel. This is pretty jarring when you're reading the strip online.

(In the case of RAW, which is shot live, this will usually be something that happened <em>during</em> the commercial break.) Also in the case where an angle (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">storyline</a>) and/or gimmick (character) is quickly chucked out and it's expected that people will simply not remember it or will be nice enough to overlook it. The IWC frequently does neither. You're supposed to give the fans three months before things can be dropped.
</li><li> If a top or upper-midcard wrestler is injured for a substantial period of time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceReturn">he will ALWAYS come back as a Face</a>. Even if he was the most despicable and dastardly of Heels at the time of his injury. Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> once vocally pointed this out upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>'s return from a nasty quad tear, and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">made out to be a huge jerk</a> for doing so.
</li><li> Professional wrestling subverts this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> declared the "Seven Year Rule", which states that after 7 years have passed it's safe to recycle a character, gimmick and/or storyline. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon">Carlito</a> Caribbean Cool's gimmick had a substantial overlap with that of Razor Ramon, but because enough time had passed since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a> quit portraying Razor, Carlito got over. However, pro wrestling also has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">Three Month Rule</a>, which plays this a little straighter. While it won't necessarily repeat things that happened three months ago, it will expect viewers to forget them and consider them out of continuity.
</li><li> This is a frequent criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a>'s booking.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As noted above, this trope is actually bit of a necessity in video games, due to the possibility of players deciding to stop playing at whatever point they're at for an undisclosed amount of time. Having a reminder of what you did when you load up a save can be annoying if you were just playing not too long ago, but otherwise useful if you <em>haven't</em> been playing for a long while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DriverSanFrancisco">Driver: San Francisco</a></em> is a big offender, using television style "previously on" exposition moments. This is fine for players who may take a break between levels, but is particularly silly playing through the first few levels, which are easy to knock out in the space of an hour or two. <em>Driver 2</em> also featured abridged recaps in the cutscenes throughout replays of the story when you started a new playing session, regardless of where you were in the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> in general has a bad habit of this. Want to pick an Apricorn off a tree? Well, prepare to be reminded of your actions from shaking the tree, getting the colored Apricorn, being told what colored Apricorn you got, and then having you put it in the bag. Berries play out much the same way; the player is told what kind of berry's on the tree, how many of (X) berry they got, and then that they put (X) berry in the bag... every single time. It also happens with HMs like Rock Smash, Strength, or Cut. Weather moves like Rain Dance and Hail remind you of their effects every turn until they fade. As for game-specific examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a></em> do this with a recap of what you did every time you load your file. One can press the Start button to skip the recaps, thankfully.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>, message boxes for weather ("Rain continues to fall", etc.) appear only once. "'X 'mon was buffeted by the Sandstorm", however, wasn't removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers</a> of Time/Darkness</em> uses this a lot more than it should. Some of the most memorable scenes get flashed back to multiple times in the same cutscene, any time you escape from danger your partner feels the need to tell you what just happened, the ending cutscene is a collection of flashbacks, and occasionally your own character will flash back to what just happened, have an internal monologue about what just happened, tell the partner what just happened, and then the partner will repeat it back to you. <br/><br/>This is especially bad during the longer cutscenes that have one or two breaches so you can save between them. The game assumes that you saved at each break and forgot all that happened. Kind of hilarious when you see your partner reminisce about what happened a few seconds ago in a black-and-white flashback.
</li></ul></li><li> A variation of this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> video game Via Domus: the game is (like the show) split into episodes, and each one starts with a "Previously on <em>Lost</em>" segment recapping the game so far. This would be fine, except that there's no way to quit the game in between episodes, so you're invariably recapping something you've just seen. The previously part does show up again when you reload the game where it might actually be needed, though.
</li><li> Also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren">Siren</a>: Blood Curse</em>. The episodes are so short you wouldn't normally stop after just one, yet they remind you of what you just did twenty minutes ago. Now if you were playing the episodes as they came out, this was mildly helpful and made sense, but if you're playing the boxed console release today it can get annoying.
</li><li> And again used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a></em>. The episodes, however, are quite long. Granted, <em>Alan Wake</em> is designed to emulate a TV Mini-series, to the extent that each of the game's six episodes has a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> Alan Wake" segment at the beginning. It's also useful for those who quit playing at the end of the previous episode to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhereWasIGoingAgain">catch-up</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series can sometimes be guilty of this. Snake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition">repeats everything everyone tells him, but in an inquisitive tone</a>.</em> "The key is made of a shape-memory alloy!" "A <em>shape-memory alloy</em>?!" "Yes! It changes based on the temperature!" "It changes based on the temperature, huh?" This actually becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> when you realize Snake doesn't do this to benefit the player, since the player often has no use for the information anyway. He does it so he himself remembers what he is searching for. Not very effective when Snake does this when informed about something he should already know about, such as <em>the sights on a freakin' rifle.</em> Thanks, Nastasha!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em> has the infamous scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Taro</a> falls into a river</span>. The scene is played over <em>three times</em> before the player can regain control, and two of these are completely unskippable. It was likely to segue dialogue, but it also plays during the Next Chapter skit for almost no reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea5AllianceOfVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea5AllianceOfVengeance">Disgaea 5</a></em> drones on too long during the cutscenes because of this trope. Party members will constantly parrot or lengthen their questioning when given any topic they don't know about, rather than use emotes or single words to replace many of the extremely simple-worded questions, and some of the flashbacks are a whole minute long when they could have been briefly summarized with plain text in five seconds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a></em>, about 80% of the occurrences of anyone saying or Emil remembering Richter's phrase "courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality" follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackToCatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackToCatchPhrase">with a flashback to when he first said it</a>, despite the fact that it was unusual for a guy like him to say that kind of thing it would be impossible to forget he said it even if you tried. If that wasn't enough, there's usually at least one flashback to a different part of that conversation (or the just-after one where you meet Marta) every half an hour of gameplay. <br/><br/>Emil and Marta also keep a diary where they take turns to write every little bit of information involving the story, details of the dialogues included; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy">Marta's parts are in pink while Emil's are in blue</a>. However reading the entries is optional and it's a good way to remind what happened to a player who took a break of several months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SigmaStarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SigmaStarSaga">Sigma Star Saga</a></em>, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>, makes heavy use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition">Parrot Exposition</a>, but unlike in <em>Metal Gear</em>, it's not a character trait. Rather, Recker does it when and only when you're told at the end of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">Infodump</a> that advancing the plot will require an action other than killing things. Since he usually uses similar words to the previous speaker, it's not a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a>, but since skipping dialogue skips partway through a conversation rather than skipping the entire thing, and since Recker's repetition is always the first thing said after a skip, it apparently caters to those who consider the plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory">irrelevant</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em>, Claves and Jazz have a talk about a traitor in the group. Immediately after, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Claves, the traitor, is killed by Rondo for not pinning the blame on another member. It would be somewhat sad if Claves didn't have a 20-minute musing on her life, including a flashback to the scene with Jazz that happened about 2 minutes ago</span>.
</li><li> Mostly averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>. You get a very stylish scrolling text segment explaining what's going on in the plot at the time if you save your game, quit, and come back later. This prevents them from having to explain anything in the cutscenes again.
</li><li> Originally having been made for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> where it makes sense for such recaps if players ever put the game down, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations">Resident Evil: Revelations</a></em> has "Previously On" segments at the beginning of every single chapter that recap everything leading up to the probable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> that the next chapter then starts off from (if the narrative doesn't swap to another character, anyway). When the game got an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> for consoles, however, this was not mended <em>at all</em> despite the systems owing to longer play sessions.

However, it's actually the <em>game</em> that has the memory of a goldfish. There was a bit of code accidentally left out of the game that caused the flags for the rupee messages to not save when the game did, so when you turn the game off, it "forgets" that it ever told you what the rupees were worth, and does so again. It's possible to hack your save file to add the missing code and fix the problem, and it's fixed in the Wii U <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> as well.

Of course, this can be justified by the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> plot. You get reminded about the rupees every cycle because you technically <em>haven't</em> picked up that color before.

After the hero crashes his airship, he recounts how he crashed his airship, then goes into a flashback of the events of getting to the airship and the dialogue around it, which happened <em>a minute ago</em>.

They're episodic titles, with a new bite sized episode getting released every two months or so. Because the chances are you'll have forgotten some of the plot points by the time you pick up a new episode, each segment opens with a flashback not unlike the ones you see at the start of TV shows. However, the kicker comes when you start playing episodes back to back, meaning each episode opens with a lengthy segment on what you just did a few minutes ago.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series plays this straight a lot, but subversions are not unheard of either. The games flash back to previous scenes many times, sometimes even to scenes from only minutes ago. However, it also expects the player to remember facts from quite a bit ago. Many contradictions require you to present evidence that doesn't have contradictory text/content in the evidence screen information. Rather you have to remember a specific detail that was stated about the evidence beforehand, yet that's not been put into the evidence information.
<ul><li> Notable straight plays:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em> has Lamiroir's performance and the scene with the victim's last words replayed near a dozen of times, with the repeats sometimes less than a minute apart! You could argue that it's done for dramatic effect, but even so, it can pretty easily get annoying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em> has an over-the-top example where Phoenix recalls Nahyuta saying X earlier followed by a brief flashback to Nahyuta saying X.
</li></ul></li><li> Subversions:
<ul><li> At the end of case 2-4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you must use the available evidence to take down Matt Engarde while still saving Maya at the same time</span>. You only get one change to present one piece of evidence and there is only one piece of evidence that can do this, plus you are given no help or hints as to what to do. Anyone who can't remember that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">De Killer, the assassin who has kidnapped Maya, said his bond of trust is one of the keys to his operations with clients, as well as the fact that Matt Engarde stated in a brief encounter that the video tape he had was his "insurance" against De Killer</span> is well and truly screwed at this point.
</li><li> Case 1-4 features a newspaper article about a giant monster that has been reported spotted in a lake. At one point you must present this article <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to prove that a witness was at said lake looking for the monster. The proof is that the article says the monster made a "BANG!" noise and that the witnesses camera was set to respond to loud bangs</span>. This fact is however not stated in the evidence screen so it is something that the player must remember on their own.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em>, flashbacks to not even a full scene ago happen fairly often, with one flashback showing something that happened roughly <em>thirty seconds beforehand</em>. In particular, flashbacks to the scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyoko first informs Makoto of Mukuro's existence</span> happen on a near-constant basis.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em>, during the second trial, the game once flashes back to something Fuyuhiko said <em>earlier in the trial.</em> It's a fairly significant line, but the game has no faith in the players' ability to remember something Fuyuhiko said less than an hour ago.

</li><li> Basic essay writing with a thesis-introduction-body-conclusion format, especially at the high school level. <em>Three</em> of those are normally used to say what the paper is about. As Dale Carnegie put it — "Tell the audience what you're going to say, say it; then tell them what you've said."
</li><li> This is actually used, in a much more <em>sensible</em> format, in writing scientific papers. The abstract, which is equivalent to a thesis, is what people reading through papers read to decide if they <em>do</em> care and often the part you get for absolutely free when looking through a search, and the conclusion is often what will be looked for if the reader is not, in fact, as interested in the 'how' as the 'what' of the experiment you're talking about. For example, if you're only after how long a goldfish's memory is, you are likely to skip entirely the procedure and the details of the results in favor of the conclusion which gives you the nice, short version of the answer and what this actually means.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">Laconic version: You skip the filler to find the result.</a>

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Students are often told by teachers when writing other essays (especially for arts and humanities such as History or English Literature) to link back every point they make to the original question - essentially, the exam board is made out to be a collective of goldfish.
</li><li> Newspaper and magazine writers will often re-introduce a character in a story every few paragraphs, just to remind readers who they are. Even TV news does this a fair bit, particularly on longer stories. For example, on first reference, "Joe Hackenmueller, who works at the hospital, says he saw the killer escape." Then a couple references to "Hackenmueller said..." or "Hackenmueller did..." followed by "Hackenmueller, the hospital worker..."
</li><li> It's easier to list political ads that <em>don't</em> rely on this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">trope</a> to appeal to the masses. Though that's probably more to use the "repeat it enough and they'll believe it" theory, than because they thought the viewers forgot it.
</li><li> Standard advice for seminary students on giving a sermon: "Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em. Tell 'em. Then tell 'em what you told 'em."
</li><li> Although short-term memory loss is often associated with conditions like dementia and Alzheimer's in eldery people, there are certain conditions that can occur even in younger people involving short-term memory loss. Some people have suffered it as a result of trauma or a stroke, they literally forget things immediately after ceasing to think of them and must write everything down to be able to do daily tasks or things like taking a bus or going someplace, and rely on a caregiver for help. Interestingly, long-term memories, things from before the trauma, may not always be affected, though it can.
<ul><li> This is called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.memorylossonline.com/glossary/anterogradeamnesia.html">anterograde amnesia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, problems forming new memories. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwigmktix2Y">In some cases, it's particularly bad.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> The trope is however partially excused by the fact that, while not having impaired memory, our brain has a habit of glossing over information and never actually storing it as memory if it doesn't see as vital. It's called selective attention, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo">and you might have already seen the most famous example.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Thus, while some play this trope insultingly straight, it's not inherently negative or useless.
</li><li> Human memory in general is far more feeble than most people think. Most people can't hold more than about seven items (digits, letters, words, etc) in short term memory, which is probably why phone numbers are seven digits. In addition, try to visualize a familiar place (such as your bedroom) where you currently aren't. While you can probably can picture the major objects (such as furniture) and what they look like, can you remember, for example, what all the books on the top shelf of your bookshelf are? Not bloody likely.
