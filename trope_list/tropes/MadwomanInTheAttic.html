</p><p>This is when a character with mental problems, and often some physical deformity, is locked away because they will never fit into society, usually either in the attic or in the basement, and often by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptHick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptHick">Corrupt Hick</a>. The more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>, the better; in fact, the smarter ones will sometimes have a secret system of peepholes and secret passages so they can move around as they please. They also tend to be inbred.
</p><p>There are two basic plotlines for this type of character:
</p><ol><li> The protagonist is an outsider, wondering what kind of bizarre secret the Corrupt Hicks are keeping. The Madwoman will then either tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>-type enemies with little personality of their own, or they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">The Grotesque</a>, sympathetic victims. When done well, this can be an effective scare because it so aptly encapsulates the frightening insularity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret">Town with a Dark Secret</a>.
</li><li> The main characters have just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHeadquarters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHeadquarters">moved into a new house</a>, and unbeknownst to them, are being watched by one of these whose caretakers have died some time ago. These are scary because of how they personify the fears of buying a new house: that your house has some hideous aspect that you haven't seen, but can see you.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is named for the landmark work of feminist literary criticism by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, referring to Mr. Rochester's wife in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlotteBronte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlotteBronte">Charlotte Brontë</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>. The analysis indicates that this trope first popularly appeared, of all places, in Victorian women's literature, where depicting some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman">women as crazy people</a> was an easy way to make female villains with whom readers would be unlikely to sympathize. Obviously, this plan was not a complete success.
</p><p>Of course, it can be the case that there was a very good reason this person was locked away in the first place. Maybe they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, maybe they suffer from an extremely contagious form of illness, or perhaps the person is being hidden for their own safety to keep them from being kidnapped or murdered.
</p><p>Usually either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">The Grotesque</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask">Man in the Iron Mask</a>.

The reasons are later explained: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had always been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a> even before Souma arrived to the family, but was allowed to live in the more modern mansion like any other family member.

Unlike other cases, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakurako</span> <em>is</em> ultimately allowed to leave the warehouse/"attic" and come back to the main home, mostly because of a fire in there that revealed the deceit; when speaking to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Souma</span> few after her release, the person offhandedly says that they now have some difficulty to walk, due to having been locked in a relatively small space for so long.

<ul><li> One featured a gifted writer, hiding in the attic after committing a murder over a decade ago. He was very sane indeed, just rather confused/fascinated over a cellphone.
</li><li> One case had a subversion. Ran's father is called in by two men, to find a huge treasure allegedly hidden in their new house. Throughout the story, Conan catches glimpses of a shadowy, scary figure sneaking around, leading readers to suspect this trope... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the figure is not dangerous or insane, but was the <em>actual</em> owner of the house, a woman who was locked in the attic when the two men broke in to steal the treasure.

Extensive grief and starvation have taken their toll on him, leaving him bed-ridden except for during violent episodes where he attacks anyone near him. This forces the servants to keep him drugged, lying to him about what happened and over-hunting to keep him from dying.

The grandmother is very much in on this (delivers meals, etc.), is rather abusive, and as Mom decides she has better things to do with her time than spend it with the kids, becomes the primary outside contact the kids have.
</li><li> There is a book, <em>Woman in the Wall</em>, where an exceptionally shy girl with a phobia of wide-open spaces did this to herself, choosing to live inside the walls of her house instead of starting school.

<ul><li> On a lighter note, there is also the ghoul in the Weasleys' attic, although he's treated like a pet, and it's ambiguous exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">what a ghoul is in this world</a>.

</li><li> Chance the Gardener in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Being There</a></em> was confined to the Old Man's house all of his life due to his mental handicap, and no one but the maids who worked in the house knew he existed. And it's possible he's the Old Man's illegitimate son to boot. The story gets underway once the Old Man dies and he is turned out of the house by the lawyers who came to close the estate. He's a nice, well-spoken person, however (partially due to his being allowed to watch television, giving him some idea of proper behavior and speech), and winds up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue">Parody Sue</a> when he encounters people who have no idea what he really is.
</li><li> The novel <em>The Cellar</em> is about a woman who keeps horrific rat-men in her old house.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>:
<ul><li> Subverted by <em>The Adventure of the Paradol Chamber</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> pastiche written by June Thomson. A woman who has befriended a young nobleman hires Holmes to investigate because she's afraid that his servants have imprisoned him in his own house. As it turns out, not only do the servants have a very good reason for locking him up, the nobleman actually <em>wanted</em> to be imprisoned in the first place, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that he suffers from a form of hereditary madness that makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> whenever it strikes. In one of his moments of sanity, the nobleman decided to have himself locked up to keep from being a danger to anyone</span>.
</li><li> Another subversion is in "The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier", written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. A soldier who made friends with another younger soldier in the Boer War hires Holmes when he thinks the younger soldier's parents are keeping him imprisoned on their family estate. Holmes indicates that there could be three possible explanations for his staying hidden there, one of which is that he's being held there because he's insane, and another one of which, upon which he settles, is the correct one. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the younger soldier contracted what he thinks is leprosy during his time in South Africa, and the family was keeping him at home in secret to treat him without his being locked up in a hospital. The younger soldier, who's actually only suffering from treatable icthyosis, voluntarily went along with this.</span>
</li><li> Then there's "The Yellow Face," in which the <em>suspected</em> Madwoman in the Attic in fact turns out to be simply the main character's mixed-race daughter from a previous marriage, whom she'd kept hidden from her new husband. In a variation form the norm in this trope, the little girl is happy and healthy; she lived in a small but comfortable cottage in a remote part of the estate, she was well-fed and cared for, and her mother visited her whenever possible. Once Holmes reveals who she is, her new stepfather accepts her wholeheartedly.

This has no bearing on the plot, it's just one of the things that establish that he lives in a world of Gothic/adventure/fantasy/horror fiction clichés. A character in the story he's writing is also mentioned to have (had) a "hopelessly insane" wife whom he claimed to be dead. Well, he <em>is</em> writing a realistic, slice of life story based on the world he's living in.
</li><li> The horror novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Others" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Others">Others</a></em> has a whole wing of a nursing home filled with Freaks in the Attic. Some of them are nice people who just have a physical deformity of varying severity. The Others, though, either because of their imprisonment, or what the director of the home has been doing to them, or just madness, are true monsters.
</li><li> Both Charlie Angelfield and his father, George, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenthTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenthTale">The Thirteenth Tale</a></em> go mad after the death of their loved ones, and enter into a sort of self-inflicted imprisonment where they lock themselves in their rooms for extended periods of time.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntDimity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntDimity">Aunt Dimity: Vampire Hunter</a></em>, Lori's working hypothesis explaining the creepy looking vampire the twins saw in the woods turns on this idea; she thinks the neighbouring DuCaral family had a crazy son they kept in the house rather than an asylum, and the man escaped (possibly more than once) and stood in the woods watching the boys.

The novel plays on various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">Gothic Horror</a> tropes, and one of the ways it does this is through the character of Daisy Hawthorne, who was accidentally scarred by her husband in an archery accident and consequently wears a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousVeil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousVeil">Mysterious Veil</a> all the time.

An old woman at the library told him that "You have a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Disappointments Room</a>,</em>" where children with developmental disorders were kept by families that didn't know what else to do, and didn't want their secret known. The homeowner accepted this claim after learning that the former owner's daughter had died young, but never been mentioned in newspaper articles about the prominent family. The claim that the room had been designed to imprison her, however, or that such rooms were a common practice, <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.forteantimes.com/index.php?threads/disappointments-room.33518/">is pure speculation with no supporting evidence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

In 2015 when two potential buyers were scoping out an unoccupied house they discovered, what appeared to peepholes in the stairs. Upon further examination they happened upon the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBasement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBasement">basement</a> where they discovered crude writings on the wall, mostly about somebody named <em>Joshua</em>. The writings consisted of rules and warnings such as "No watching Isaiah through the hole" and "No writing or drawing on the walls." It is still unknown who Joshua was or <em>why</em> he was in the basement.
</li><li> The Finnish word for "batshit crazy", <em>seinähullu</em> (literally "wall-crazy") implies this trope. The incurably insane children were chained on the wall for life lest they cause any troubles to other family members.

The truth was that from about seven (when the expectation would have normally been for him to go to boarding school) he lived with his nanny 'Lala' Biggs (who, like many Edwardian nannies, seems to have been deeply bonded with her charge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">more like a foster parent</a> than a hired help) in a cottage in Sandringham Park, socialised with estate workers' children, and probably had a happier childhood than his healthy brothers. But because of the embarrassment of having a son with mental disabilities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27qub');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27qub" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27qub');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">plus epilepsy was still associated with insanity at the time</span>, his royal parents seem to have preferred to remain silent about his life<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3esso');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3esso" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3esso');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">cutting him out of official family trees</a></span> rather than publicly address the rumours.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ay9j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ay9j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ay9j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He is the Johnnie mentioned as a "sweet boy" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech">The King's Speech</a></em> and has his own tv-miniseries, Stephen Poliakoff's <em>The Lost Prince</em>.</span>
</li><li> After being revealed as a serial killer, Elizabeth Báthory was imprisoned within a bricked-up set of rooms, with only small slits left open for ventilation and the passage of food, clothing, and other necessities. She was found to have died in bed after complaining of cold hands the night before.
</li><li> Blanche Monnier was a 25 year-old woman from a wealthy family living in Poitiers, France, when her mother and brother locked her in a small attic room. Blanche desired to marry a lawyer which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">her family deemed unsuitable due to his lack of money</a>. What probably started as a temporary punishment turned into 25 years of confinement as her mother refused to allow her to leave the room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">Blanche's fits of anger and despair at her situation only convinced her mother and brother that she was mentally unstable, and enforced their belief that she should be kept sequestered</a>. Though she was finally rescued, she never quite recovered.
