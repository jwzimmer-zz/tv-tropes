</p><p>Offscreen Inertia is that, if there are no strong indications otherwise, viewers can never really be sure that a character ever stops doing the last thing they were <em>seen</em> doing. Ignorable, except when what the character was doing was memorable, noteworthy, or disturbing.

</p><p>Often the reason children find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> in "innocent" things, and if combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, can have the same result in adults. Also a prime source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>, which can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">acknowledged</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>, and may result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingWeForgot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingWeForgot">Something We Forgot</a>.
</p><p>This can also be used by more skilled writers as a way to drive home the message of the story. For example, one of the reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye">The Catcher in the Rye</a></em> works so well is that Holden is always <em>just</em> on the cusp of adulthood whilst clinging onto his childhood. Why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePigman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePigman">The Pigman</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal">and other similar books</a>) works well is that John &amp; Lorraine are always <em>just</em> trying to deal with Mr. Pignati's death, and so on.
</p><p>Also, in traditional romances and vaguely erotic thrillers that don't want to earn an "R" rating, the story will end before the hero and heroine copulate (or might end afterward, but either way the copulation is skipped), with the result that more prudish viewers have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">option</a> of believing the lovers remained chaste forever. The classic ending has the couple kissing in the most erotic yet tasteful way possible - and often ends <em>right after</em> their lips meet, sometimes as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeahShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeahShot">"YEAH!" Shot</a> ...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">which, if the convention were accepted literally, would cause one to surmise that the lovers choked to death on each others' tongues</a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> comes when you realize that they are bound to perform that action until they die, and he can't stop them.
</li><li> That girl that was geassed to mark a wall at Ashford Academy every day, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though half the academy gets destroyed</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Supplemental material</a> revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was evacuated during the Black Rebellion.

</li></ul></li><li> October 2009 and March 2010 were <em>very</em> long months for fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, thanks to this— respectively, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riza was bleeding out from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">Slashed Throat</a></span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">everyone not at the center of Father's circle was dead</a></span> for an entire month. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Curse you, Arakawa!</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NabariNoOu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NabariNoOu">Nabari no Ou</a></em>, Raikou and Gau were left lying on the ground with a sword through the gut and slashes across the face respectively for 8 chapters before they were shown again. This was <em>EIGHT MONTHS</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The battle against Pain, where they'd spend an entire chapter or two on the fight itself while the whole time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata is lying a short distance away, <em>bleeding to death.</em></span>
</li><li> A humorous invocation of this trope occurs when Might Guy summons Ningame, who we had not seen Guy summon since their introduction nearly a real-life decade and about four in-series years earlier. Ningame's reaction implies he hadn't even been summoned off-screen that whole time either!
</li></ul></li><li> Due to its untimely cancellation, the last scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em> manga was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fuuma leaning over Kamui with a sword to his chest, asking Kamui what his wish was</span>.

</li><li> Episode 15 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> uses this trope purposefully, going for the heartstrings: it ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keith waiting patiently to meet the girl he fell for earlier in the episode, not realizing that she was the robot he destroyed the night before</span>.

</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> arc where the protagonists were taken to a virtual world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Yami Marik</a> is left on board the blimp, able to do what he likes. The only thing that's stopping him from getting into the room the protagonists are locked in is the door, which he can't open. It's implied that he spends the entire arc just wandering around the blimp, occasionally trying to get open the door and kill the heroes.
</li><li> Sort of used in-character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>; England is completely stunned to realise America grew up in the several years he was away. Subverted when you realize America <em>did</em> age freakishly fast for a nation, since Italy was apparently a toddler for about nine hundred years.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em>: the author suffered an illness that left him unable to work on the series for several months. He'd left the characters in mid-match, standing in odd poses. When he came back... Kinnikuman complains about having to hold that pose for several months, and looks to Robin Mask, who's fallen asleep in the ring.
</li><li> Taken to excruciating levels with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> due to its severe and frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a>. For all we know, the Zodiacs are still preparing to go to the Dark Continent.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> due to several battles taking place at once. For example, in the Thousand Year Blood arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rangiku</span> is seen discarded with a slashed throat, but presumably alive. Then the only person who knew about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> injury passed out.
</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sayaka's</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral">Meaningful Funeral</a> from the anime version is cut, which leaves the audience to assume that her body is still in the apartment where it was taken after she died <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by turning into a Witch</span> and never found.
</li><li> In the OVA episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em>, Okabe and Kurisu are last seen stranded in the American desert, with two dead cellphones and a car with no gas. While it's nice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they reaffirm their love in the new timeline</span>, one might be left wondering how long they will have to wait to be rescued.
</li><li> An edit in international dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> 3: Spell of the Unown</em> was caused because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> and a desire to avert this trope. In the Japanese version, the scene where Molly Hale's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> Spencer is released from the Unown world plays during the end credits. The English dubbers were aware that most Western theater audiences start to file out once the credits start, so this scene was moved to before the credits so that no one would think he was stuck there forever.
</li><li> Unfortunately happened as a result of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">unresolved cliffhanger</a> in the 90's hentai manga <em>Dragon Pink</em>, by ITOYOKO. The final volume ends on the titular heroine Pink being impaled by a sword while the rest of her party watches on in horror. That volume was published in <em>1994</em>.

In his compilation/book <em>The Prehistory Of The Far Side: A 10th Anniversary Exhibit</em>, Larson mentioned his theory on why (in contrast to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> of cartoons) some people <em>REALLY hated</em> this one panel — the two dogs never, ever <em>stop</em> playing tethercat. You see the cartoon, they're playing; you turn back to this one a few pages later, they're still playing; set the book down and come back tomorrow, they're <em>still</em> playing...given the lack of information, there's no way you can say that the cat is going to escape any time soon, and the drawing doesn't make it look likely either. Larson suspected that if he'd included a caption about the cat escaping and coming back with a bazooka, he wouldn't have angered so many people.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Curtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Curtis">Curtis</a></em>, the main character once was jealous of Andrew, a boy who was spending a lot of time with Chutney. So he snuck a bottle of perfume into Andrew's shopping bag at a department store, causing Andrew to be arrested for shoplifting. When Curtis found out that Andrew was Chutney's cousin, he said that he was going to get Andrew cleared...but the plotline was dropped before readers ever saw him do so. This may have been because Curtis would have had a hard time getting Andrew released without getting <em>himself</em> into considerably more serious trouble. (Framing somebody else and getting them arrested is a lot more malicious than shoplifting.) Since Andrew has not appeared in the comic since then, for all the readers know, he might still be in jail.

So by the time we read <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, Tyrion Lannister had been traveling from King's Landing to Essos in a box for <strong>12 years</strong> real-time.

<div class="indent">This 'jump' occurs at the junction of two stories, one ending and the other starting. At the start of the new TVN, the characters are still, so to speak, stuck at the end of the last TVN. They're frozen, despite the fact that a new TVN has begun without them. This is, of course, just a literalization of what always happens: the characters freeze for a week. But this time we actually see the freezing at the end of one story, continuing into the start of the next.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>, new vampires can sometimes be 'sired' to their maker which means that they will follow any order or suggestion that the sire makes to them. Damian had this happen to a female vampire he created in the 1940s. He thought that he found a way to break the sire bond and left her behind in New Orleans. In the present he finds out that he was tricked and the sire bond was still intact. He is horrified because before he left he told her to wait on a particular street corner and count all the bricks in New Orleans. He returns to New Orleans and the vampire is in fact waiting on that street corner. The trope is subverted when she reveals that the compulsion faded after a short while and she was able to leave the corner and do other things beside waiting for him. However, she still visits the corner regularly and counts bricks as hobby.

<ul><li> A horror story called <em>Dead Letter Office</em> does this. It's about two girls who find an old letter from a criminal detailing how he hid 'it' in a small room behind the fireplace in an abandoned house. They assume that 'it' is money from a bank heist, and go to the old house to steal it. They sneak into the room, only to find that the criminal actually left one of his victims in the room to die. They try to get out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere">the door closes on them and locks from the outside</a>. It would be bad enough if the corpse didn't start laughing. You're left with the impression that the two girls are locked in the room with the laughing, rotten corpse until they die of dehydration. Although, maybe the story was meant to give the impression that they are killed by the zombie.

</li><li> The myth of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingDutchman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingDutchman">Wandering Jew</a>. While preaching, Jesus told His audience that some of them would live to see the Kingdom of God, which was a Jewish concept about the restoration of Israel and the renewal of the covenant that Jesus redefined. Later, people started interpreting the saying as referring to Jesus' second coming and, since (most people agree) the second coming hasn't happened yet, someone from that audience was supposed to still be alive and wandering the earth. The Wandering Jew is a specific example of this from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>: according to the story, one man who taunted Jesus during the crucifixion was cursed to walk the Earth until the second coming.

</li><li> If you never recruit him, it's possible to leave Sabin in <em>VI</em> holding up a house beam. Forever.
</li><li> If you never rescue Vincent Valentine in <em>VII</em> from the locked basement, it's assumed that he'll simply stay there forever. Presumably, all he was doing in the thirty years up to his release was sleeping in some perpetual nightmare state.

Most players assumed he was dead, and were really surprised to find out (from the game's sequels) that this was never intentional and he was supposed to still be alive at the end of the game.
</li><li> The game has a bit of fun with this in the part where the player gets the option to take the Shinra soldiers on board the submarine hostage. If you do this, scenes much later in the game that take place in the submarine interior will have the soldiers still standing around with their hands up, apparently not having moved.

A lot of fans felt somewhat cheated by the fact that, for instance, Cloud apparently adopted a young boy at some point between the original game and the sequel, or that Cid and Shera were now married and had a new ship.

As the year goes by, talking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non-Player Characters</a> reveals that their dialogue changes every few days — their lives are going on in the background, unobserved by you.
</li><li> A bug in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> had this in the most literal sense. The banners in the attacker's spawn on Volskaya Industries could be destroyed, much like everything else in the room. However, shooting the banner, quickly turning around, and then turning back to the banner (even after upwards of 5-10 seconds) caused the banner to continue falling from wherever it was when you turned away from it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear 1</a></em>, Gray Fox is supposedly rescued by Snake before the first boss, but he's left in the prison cell and isn't seen later, even in the ending after Outer Heaven blows up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> which establish that Fox was Snake's mentor and "showed him the ropes" makes this even more absurd.
</li><li> In a similar situation, many fans mock the fact that the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SnakesRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SnakesRevenge">Snake's Revenge</a></em> just has Jennifer standing in the corner of the room striking a pose instead of attempting to escape the exploding Fortress Fanatic.

<ul><li> The game generally establishes the convention that when you SAVE and turn the console off, Snake is sleeping. When you next load the save, he will have healed damage somewhat depending on how long you wait, but also food in his inventory may have rotted if it's not captured alive or preserved.
</li><li> The boss fight with The End incorporates a lot of this. SAVE, turn off and reload during the battle, and The End will have crept up on Snake while he was waiting, frozen, in limbo, resulting in an instant loss. But if you wait more than a week, you'll find The End died of old age while waiting for you to get back.
</li><li> One part late in the game requires you to stuff Ivan Raikov in a locker in Groznyj Grad's weapon storage wing, where (fitting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status) he was presumably supposed to remain forever — the Brady Games strategy guide even notes that Raikov was "left to die." Groznyj Grad is later blown up by Snake using TNT, and many players assumed he was dead (as killing him doesn't cause a Time Paradox like with many other prominent NPCs). Volgin only chooses to punish Snake for "hurting" Ivan, and doesn't seem particularly interested in finding out Ivan's whereabouts, as it was intended for his survival to be dependent on the feelings of the player. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a></em> establishes that Raikov survived, though not how he got out of the locker. (Perhaps Volgin sent out a search party for him at some point.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The menu screen of the fifth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> game combines this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingThroughTheMotions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingThroughTheMotions">Going Through the Motions</a> — it shows a single human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Inquisitor</a> locked in mortal combat with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Inferno Archdevil</a>, animated with the same video engine as the rest of the game. In actual gameplay, Archdevils are vastly more powerful and can easily kill whole squads of Inquisitors with a single swing of its mace, but no matter how long you leave the menu screen open, the two will still be deftly dodging and parrying each other's blows with no end of the battle in sight.

The narrator concludes with Neither he nor I were ever seen again in our lives, and since the voice telling the story as an adult, he's presumably still flying.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> episode "Mindful Education," Steven and Connie fall off the Gems' training platform high in the air, with Pearl and Garnet looking on in horror. They're able to save themselves, and then the episode ends right there, without our getting to see Pearl and Garnet learn they survived and seeming to leave them gazing helplessly over the edge for a whole week.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien">All Hail King Julien</a></em>; Uncle King Julien is dropped into a bottomless pit at the end of an episode, and when he is needed a season later, the gang return to the bottomless pit to find him, having apparently been hanging onto the wall the entire time since.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode "The Bully", there's a joke where a bunch of people beat up an old man, mistaking him for SpongeBob's attacker. Later, Flats is said to be in an coma for five hours. They make the same joke with the same people and the old man. Why would they have stayed in the same place for five hours?
<ul><li> In "Franken Doodle", a guy is on a boat and his pencil falls into the ocean where SpongeBob and Patrick find it. The rest of the episode takes place over an entire night. It ends with SpongeBob and Patrick flinging the pencil back to the surface where the guy is still there on the boat. Odd he would have stayed there for an entire night.

<ul><li> Everyone's had the experience where someone leaves, then comes back, and you're doing the same thing you were doing when they left, and they assume "you haven't moved", no matter <em>how much</em> you managed to get done in the time they were gone.
<ul><li> One web article about job performance mentions as much when cautioning about taking smoke breaks or similar.
</li><li> Similarly, if you have pets, especially cats, and leave for several hours, when you return to find them sleeping in the same spot as when you left, you have to wonder if they even ever moved at all.
</li><li> Also zoo animals, especially if the animal is a nocturnal species and has a favorite sleeping spot in its enclosure.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, young children's murky understanding of the concept of "permanence" (that an item might still be there when you don't see it) is what makes playing peek-a-boo with them work.
<ul><li> Babies' lack of object permanence is also why they often cry when you leave the room. They aren't just worried that you won't come back — they don't understand that you still <em>exist</em>.
</li><li> This entire trope is essentially object permanence gone haywire. It takes us a while after we're born to get the idea that things are still there when we can't see them, and apparently, once that idea gets into our heads, it's tough to shake it.
</li></ul></li><li> You have to wonder if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PsavsRcQno">ever stopped explaining the "Domino" effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em>The Song That Never Ends</em>.
<ul><li> "I know a song that gets on everybody's nerves..."
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> NASA's lunar rovers are still just sitting there on the moon, in the same positions they've been in for 40 years. Given America's budget woes and NASA's perennial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> status in DC, that's not likely to change anytime soon.
<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a> story there's still a lander abandoned on the Moon in the year <em>171,257</em>. It's a historical monument of sorts.
</li><li> This sort of thing is invoked horrifically and sadly by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd">xkcd</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/695/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This generally happens if you try to personify any of NASA's deep space exploration equipment, since it can get rather heartwrenching. Heck, even /b/ cries when people start talking about Voyager-tan. <a class="urllink" href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/06/12/scientists-rescue-voyager-2-probe-on-edge-of-solar-system/">Meanwhile, a happy story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A more personal example in the form of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2011/10/elizabeth_and_hazel_what_happened_to_the_two_girls_in_the_most_f.single.html">Hazel Bryan,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a white girl immortalized by a famous picture where she is enraged at a young black girl desegregating her high school. Hazel learned from her mistake and grew out of it over the subsequent 50 years, but in that picture she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">forever a snarling racist.</a>
</li><li> When you don't see a child for a long time, you tend to assume that they stayed about the same age they were when you last saw them. This happens a lot with relatives who don't often see each other. ("What? How can Becky Sue be thirteen already? She was six when I last saw her!" "Because the last time you saw her was seven years ago.") This also affects the public's perception of child actors, especially when they haven't done any acting since they were a kid. And even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning">Dakota Fanning</a> stayed in the public eye when she grew up, the public was still slow to grasp the fact that, no, she is not eternally twelve years old.
<ul><li> It didn't help that she consistently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">played characters significantly younger than she was</a> and then suddenly started playing characters her own age. While a 15-year-old becoming a 16-year-old normally isn't jarring, a 15-year-old who played 10-year-olds for a couple of years becoming a 16-year-old who plays 16-year-olds takes a bit of getting used to.
</li><li> Similar issues arise for many actresses who originally make their mark as children or teenagers in kids shows such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Hannah</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Montana</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff">Lizzie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">McGuire</a>. Hilary Duff once complained in a Maxim interview that she would get chastised for not acting like a proper fourteen year old girl when she was in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp">twenty three.</a> In more recent times, snarky articles like to point out that nineteen year old Miley Cyrus is criticized for acting like some sort of partying college girl. It doesn't help that she got those same complaints when she actually <em>was</em> still underage.
</li></ul></li><li> Plenty of items that were sealed in tombs or covered with rubble or dust or sand are still sitting where they were left when archaeologists come along centuries later. However, in the case of Pompeii, there were holes in the volcanic ash that preserved the exact positions people were in as they died, such that we now have plaster casts of a dog eternally stealing a raisin cake, a man eternally running, a husband eternally trying to cover his pregnant wife's eyes... It's all rather creepy.
</li><li> High-profile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a> filings are always breathlessly announced and trumpeted by the news media, but the results of these suits are almost never reported on. It's probably because there's nothing sensational about a groundless claim getting dismissed by a judge, but it often leaves the general public to assume that such cases spend years clogging up the legal system, long after they'd already been tossed out of court.
