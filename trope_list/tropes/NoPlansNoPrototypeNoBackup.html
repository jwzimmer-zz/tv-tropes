There is only one of it, there are no plans or schematics for it, and no earlier generations of development exist. In the case of expensive and rushed projects, the final project might have been made by cannibalizing parts of the prototype, or might actually <em>be</em> the prototype after a whole lot of upgrades and patches. Either way, no backup copies exist <em>at all</em> of either the device's hardware or software. Thus the hero may safely blow it up, blast it with EMP or otherwise render it useless, confident that no one can recreate the technology — or worse, just take version 0.9 out of storage and use <em>that</em> the moment he leaves.

Maybe the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde">first attempt was tainted during creation</a>, or maybe a talented composer dies before they can record their techniques. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">Once the original is lost, it's gone forever.</a>

Mad Science is magic-like in how it can inexplicably summon up something that its own creator doesn't quite understand. (Or, this trope is unnecessary if the creation could be replicated but only the original can be used <em>in time</em> to affect the story... the trope applies once that story stretches to weeks or years and needs some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a> to prevent replications.)

In this case, the remorseful researcher does keep notes, which he will either attempt to burn or erase himself, or will ask the heroes to destroy for him. Nor does it apply when the experiment results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">Psycho Prototype</a>; in these cases, the researcher will make changes to the plans and build a second, "good" version, to fight the first, "bad" one (of course, the trope may kick in right after that...).
</p><p>Occasionally subverted after the customary celebration of the superweapon being destroyed, with one hero ominously pointing out, "yes... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">but there's nothing to stop them building another.</a>" Or the superweapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousDeviceDisposalDebacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousDeviceDisposalDebacle">hadn't actually been destroyed as they thought</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averts</a> this trope through the characters of Robin and Franky, and at least one story arc. Robin is the last survivor of an archaeological society that knew how to decode ancient glyphs that reveals the true history of a lost civilization, including that of three ancient superweapons, one being a battleship that could annihilate <em>entire islands</em>; Franky is the most recent in a line of shipbuilders to inherit buleprints for Pluton, said superweapon. The World Government is both trying to erase memory of the superweapon from the general populace and either find or recreate it.
<ul><li> It also is a plot point for the Water 7 arc. The reason the blueprints for Pluton exist in the first place was because the original planners designed it as not an offensive measure, but a <em>defensive</em> one. As Franky put it, if there was a chance the World Government or some other rogue group could remake one of the superweapons, the Pluton plans would be their countermeasure. However, with Spandam having learned of their existence and going after Frank and Robin, he proceeds to burn the plans since there was no point in having them around if people knew. Instead, he bets it all on the Strawhats rescuing Robin and thus leaving Spandam and the World Government without them.
</li><li> The other superweapons remain unknown though one is <em>technically</em> averted with Posiedon, namely that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's actually a person. Specifically a mermaid who can command Sea Kings, the giant sea monsters and is reincarnated every long while, the latest one being the Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi</span>. Nothing is known on the last one, Uranus.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> in reference to Mosuke's most powerful sword, Harusame, which was ironically made of melted up junk metal and an old hunting knife. After creating it, the emperor ordered Amidamaru to kill Mosuke so as to make Harusame follow this trope. Even though the Emperor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plan</a> somewhat fails, Harusame remains a sword of unparalleled power.
</li><li> Ram-Dass in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry">Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry</a></em> was an <em>illegal</em> experimental prototype, and The Gloire was a modified "regular" Gloire whose modifiers did quite well for people that didn't have the plans for the original.
</li><li> Braver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory">Transformers Victory</a></em> invents a device that can detect Decepticons within ; Jean, Holi, and Star Saber all seize on the idea of placing a bunch of them at strategic points around the world. Braver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaves</a> this away by saying the device requires specialised components, but they still put the device to good use. At the end of the episode, however, Leozack steals it, and Braver vows to start his research from scratch. Couldn't he just have remembered how to make it?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheSlayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheSlayers">The Slayers</a></em> plays with this. Goru Nova, the Sword of Light, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon">Forgotten Superweapon</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcaliburInTheRust">Excalibur in the Rust</a>, a blade which can cut through anything, absorb and fire back enemy magic, amplify the spells cast by the bearer, and <strong>actually damage</strong> the dark powers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> in their true bodies. The last is especially important because their true bodies don't even exist in our reality, but another layer of it altogether.
<ul><li> It is also the only known way to kill the monster Zannafar, a creature the aforementioned gods fear because Zannafar does not exist where they can harm it, and its purely physical body has impenetrable armor. No one's ever been able to duplicate it over the millennium since it was last seen, and they'd love to. Likewise, the gods would rather see it forgotten forever than replicated. The thing that makes Goru Nova so special? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside-Context Problem</a> combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a>. Goru Nova is from a different universe entirely, and the personal weapon of Darkstar Dugranigdu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> for that universe. Effectively a piece of him itself, this makes Goru Nova a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonKing">Demon King</a> in its own right.
</li><li> This becomes a major plot point in the third season, where we learn that Darkstar didn't have just one weapon like that. And someone is searching for the other <em>four</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em> averts this. The reason Dr. Hell always has unique robots instead of rebuilding the good ones is because he didn't build them to begin with, and he's a biologist, so it's not like he could fix them up if he wanted to. And in the case of <em>Mazinger Z</em> not only <em>was</em> there a prototype, but Juuzou Kabuto also made numerous objects out of Super Alloy Z, and was known for having loads of patents that most likely came out of testing parts for the eponymous robot. Furthermore, several of the Photon Power Labs robots are armed with variations of the Rust Hurricane and Breast Fire weapons that Mazinger Z is armed with, suggesting they were created to test those weapons.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> had constructed a particle accelerator that could be used to destroy Hell's Gate, which would wipe out every single contractor instantly. Amber's group, naturally wishing to prevent this, sent in a strike team to destroy it. After they managed it, the scientist was ranting about what a waste it was... at which point his bosses informed him that they'd made a backup without telling him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em> has ZAFT failing miserably in terms Gundam prototypes, making several powerful suits which become the source of agony for them as they get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype">Grand Theft Prototype</a> and the Federation of all groups managing to mass produce at least one feature into their new mobile suits (The Jet Striker pack for the Dagger-L and the Windam look like a smaller version of Justice's backpack, while the Wild Dagger is an Alliance Dagger-L with the ZAFT Gaia Gundam's transforming ability.). The Earth Alliance second set of Gundams gotten a mass production upgrade for their non <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> soldiers.
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> with ZAFT's new generation of Gundams: Of the five, Chaos and Saviour have prototypes, and ZAFT made multiple Impulses with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">Mecha Expansion Packs</a> that reproduce the abilities of Gaia, Chaos and Abyss — and then MSV introduced a Destiny pack for the Impulse, as well as a prototype for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a>'s Legend Gundam.
<ul><li> Also subverted in the Federation mobile armors. The first one usually served as an occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, but afterward multiples would appear in their forces.
</li><li> The biggest aversion comes at the climax of the series.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not only did they apparently get their hands on Patrick Zala's designs for the Genesis Superweapon, they even duplicated it and <em>improved</em> it, going so far as to make it so that it doesn't melt the reflector mirrors AND mounted it on a moving asteroid fortress.</span>
</li><li> This actually went back all the way to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSeedAstray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSeedAstray">Gundam SEED Astray</a></em> when the Junk Guild claim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> GENESIS Alpha, a second GENESIS</span> as their own home base.
</li><li> The 1/100 Master Grade model for the Strike Freedom Gundam revealed that <em>it</em> was meant to be mass produced, but Terminal, Lacus Clyne's secret organization, found the plans when they'd been shoved away, took them for their own and deleted the original copy from ZAFT's computers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series set in the Universal Century averts this to all hell and back, especially once Anaheim Electronics comes into the picture.
<ul><li> In the original series, this is played straight... from Zeon's point of view. They did make plans and backups and even prototypes of their Zakus. The only error is that Amuro has all the files on his personal computer... Luckily for the Zeon, Amuro has learned absolutely nothing about the Zaku II, its combat capabilities and future Mobile Suits, despite the fact that we saw him studying the schematics in the beginning of the first episode.
</li><li> It still happened once, with the F99 Recordbreaker Gundams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam">Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: The Steel Seven</a></em>. These Gundams were equipped with the extremely powerful Minovksy Drive (aka the "Wings of Light") a full twenty years before it showed up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a></em>. The Jovian Empire managed to destroy all three prototypes, along with all the plans and research for it in their attack on the lunar base, forcing the system to pretty much have to be re-invented from scratch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although it's also revealed that Anaheim Electronics had a head start in re-inventing it by salvaging the wreckage after the Jovian attack.</span>
</li><li> This also happened concerning the G-Defenser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>.

Charizard promptly left Ash's team 1 episode later, and wouldn't return outside of tournament arcs (where Team Rocket typically doesn't antagonize Ash during) for over a decade's worth of episodes.

<ul><li> Comics love this trope, as it allows for unique items that <em>only</em> the hero or villain has. It's also used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> generator.
</li><li> The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> is one of a kind in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a></em> is because the only person who knew the formula for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> Serum got shot right after administering it to Cap. Furthermore, for security reasons, that scientist kept no notes of the full treatment, relying on his memory. Attempts at reproducing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">haven't gone so well.</a>
<ul><li> So, of course, Arnim Zola was able to create a clone of Cap <em>complete with Super Solder Serum</em> — and never attempted to experiment to figure out how to extract the stuff. Especially since the Serum has been completely extracted at least once and it's been shown that a blood transfusion from Cap also comes with that particular bonus. (Making it more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">Holding Back the Phlebotinum</a> than anything else, now.)
<ul><li> Same goes for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a>, who cloned Cap's body so he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">possess it</a> at least once.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Captain America I</em> #153, a man who found the formula, heretofore overlooked in Axis files (due to Allied bombings similar to Dresden, not even the Axis knew that they had it), noted that he found it untraceable in animals he had experimented upon and then dissected. He used this as leverage to force the US government to allow him to serve as a new Captain America for the Korean War — which ended before he could serve. This man later went mad due to the effects of the serum, suggesting its unpredictability on subjects. Incidentally, MLJ's the Shield seems to have inspired Captain America (the shape of Captain America's shield turned round when MLJ pointed out how closely it represented the front of the Shield's costume). The Shield's father had perfected a similar formula, but enemy agents slew him. The Shield, however, recreated his father's formula. Why he did not use it other than on himself is not stated.
</li><li> However, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a></em> universe is practically built around deconstructing this particular trope. The original Cap was one-of-a-kind — which is why every government and corporation on the planet has spent the last fifty years trying to duplicate the process, or at least come up with something similar, leading to a superhuman arms race. The Ultimate Hulk was the result of a failed attempt, the OZ formula that gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> his powers was another — pretty much every superhuman in this universe, except for the mutants, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin">owe their powers to some attempt at recreating the super-soldier project.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually, even the mutants are revealed to be a result of a super-soldier-related project, making the deconstruction even more wide-ranging.</span>
</li><li> Interestingly enough, there was a <em>precursor</em> plan: before making the formula, Dr. Erskine formulated a special diet and exercise regiment that would optimize the human body to its peak. However, because of the wartime issues, the plans were stored away and thus research was made into the formula. Eventually, a grandson of Erskine discovered the plans and proceeded to put it through his newborn, Micheal Van Patrick and sure enough, the young man grew up to possess the same capability and talents as Cap himself though diet and exercise. While MVP would not last long as a character, he has been cloned more than a few times.
</li><li> More, Captain America's shield is one of a kind, never duplicated; the guy who made it had no idea what he was doing and thus, wasn't keeping records and, according to some stories, fell asleep while working on it, and when he woke-up, the shield was made.
<ul><li> A tweak to Ultimate Cap's origin established that the head scientist was simply a cruddy record-keeper and did not write everything down before rudely getting shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em> puts a different spin on his shield: Howard Stark presents Steve with multiple options for a shield, but Cap spots a disc shaped one that Howard explains is a vibranium prototype. Why can't more be made? It took the entire world supply of vibranium to make it. (At least, the <em>known</em> world supply at that time—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> and then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther (2018)</a></em> establishes that there <em>is</em> more, but Wakanda has been doing everything in its power to keep it out of the hands of the rest of the world.)

In this continuity, the symbiote was created by Peter Parker and Eddie Brock's fathers rather than being an alien, and was left in Eddie's possession after they died, until Peter accidentally infected himself with a sample of it. He manages to get rid of it when it almost drives him crazy, then convinces Eddie to let him destroy the rest of the sample. Peter leaves with the container, then Eddie walks over to a locker and opens it to reveal another container with a backup. He even lampshades this, saying "Guess they haven't taught you about backups in high school." However, after this backup sample turns Eddie into Venom, none of the work is left, and he never attempts to recreate the formula, even though he'd be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">sell it to the military for billions</a>. It's a moot point anyway since earlier in the comic, Peter found out that the symbiote, as well as all notes and research involving its creation were seized from Richard Parker and Eddie Brock Sr. by Trask Industries, the company that was funding it. Dr. Parker had something of a mini-breakdown after finding out, and Peter couldn't sell the formula if he wanted to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Venom becomes known, all research about the symbiote is seized from Trask by Nick Fury and the Ultimates to make absolutely sure the suit is never re-created, except by them.</span>
</li><li> Nobody knows why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation">A.I.M.</a> only created one Super-Adaptoid, one of their most powerful creations, but one can assume that either the blueprints were destroyed or its creation was an accident that can't be replicated. Given how powerful it is and much trouble it has given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> over the years, they'd definitely have created more than one if they could. It was eventually revealed that a sliver of the original Cosmic Cube was used to power it, when it was removed by the evolving Cube it was rendered inert (although Dom found a way to revive it). A later arc had A.I.M. creating a number of adaptoids but these copies were less powerful, only able to copy a single individual.

He's an <em>idiot savant</em> who can build miraculous things by simply tinkering with junk, but even <em>he</em> doesn't know how most of them truly work. As a result, nothing he builds can be duplicated. By far, the most advanced invention he's created was Widget, a small, sentient robot capable of opening portals, who became a companion to the heroes.

</li><li> The minor Marvel character <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfHearts">Jack Of Hearts</a> got his power from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> involving his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Zero Fluid</a>, an apparently limitless energy source that would have solved the world's energy crisis... had the creator not been shot dead and the only sample in existence absorbed into Jack.
</li><li> Silver Age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> got his powers because a lightning bolt struck a cabinet full of random chemicals, which then spilled onto him. Subsequent attempts to find out which combination of chemicals would, when lightning-struck, yield similar results have all been failures.
<ul><li> However, by sheer coincidence, the Flash just happened to set up the <em>right</em> combination of chemicals when demonstrating this to his young protege — without taking any notes, of course — and lo, another freak lightning bolt created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Flash</a>.
</li><li> Actually, this eventually turned out to be the origin of the original Professor Zoom who started out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy">fanboy</a> who successfully duplicated the accident after years of painful treatments in order to use Barry's old treadmill to go back and hang out with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Aversion, or at least subversion: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>. He not only has multiple versions of his armor stretching back to his first one (and has used previous versions to solve a current problem), but one of the key storylines in the comic series was how his foe Obidiah Stane got a hold of all his armor research and technology when he took over Stark's company.
<ul><li> Not to mention that, almost uniquely, there is actually another superhero running around with his toys — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> uses one of Tony's suits modified with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArmorWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArmorWars">Armor Wars</a></em> storyline had Tony try to invoke this trope after one too many villains got their mitts on his suit tech, causing him to go a little overboard in his pursuit of unauthorized users of his armor technologies as several other heroes utilizing powered armor got involved.
</li><li> For a few select Stark Technologies, Tony deliberately invokes and justifies this trope, as he is painfully familiar with the bad guys stealing his secrets and abusing them.
</li></ul></li><li> V in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>. He blew up the research plant, killed the doctor and was the only survivor anyhow. It hardly matters since the formula that created V had totally random effects on everyone it was injected into (One test subject who died from it was mentioned to have had fingers growing inside her calves for example).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a>, the sentient, intelligent, super-strong robot built by Tesla in the 1920s is one of a kind, and Tesla made certain no records or information on the countless innovations in Robo exist outside his own mind.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a> villain the Red King is a sideways look at this trope. He had the ability to access multiple universes, try various things in them, and keep the ones he liked. He used this to (among other things) win horse races, become a billionaire/media darling, and get a hot girlfriend. When he decides to get super-powers, he has research teams in billions of universes try various approaches and keeps the best ones. As far as his employees knew, the boss just showed up one day and gave them a disc with files showing perfect, foolproof, side-effect-free procedures for giving virtually any super-power imaginable. After his defeat by the Justice League, one assumes the disc is still in his corporate files somewhere...
</li><li> In <em>Adrenalynn: Weapon of War</em>, the only scientist capable of creating the revolutionary cyborgs such as Adrenalynn (who was the last cyborg he created), hung himself out of shame for doing that to a little girl.

The research process consists of the scientist and his assistants mixing up batches of <em>stuff</em> and testing them, over and over again. Naturally, the only sample that works is the one that gets whipped up by one of the assistants just goofing around and tossing random junk into the mix — <em>right before he is killed by mob hitmen</em> in the same attack that paralyzes the scientist. In perfect keeping with this trope, the scientist doesn't think to analyze the working sample to figure out what it <em>is</em> and reproduce it, thus achieving his original research goals. Instead he builds a suit of power armor using the few bits of the stuff he has, and goes out fighting crime in it.
</li><li> Done deliberately by Batman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>.

Starfleet didn't see fit to pursue the issue further, which isn't surprising considering how the Klingons reacted to it. Given that the Genesis Device didn't receive a proper test its viability is unknown. It was designed to be used on an existing planet/moon, not create a new planet. The science team deliberately wiped all their notes to try and keep them from being captured, and then most of the science team got killed, leaving the key part of the formula only in David Marcus' memory.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">Two Trees</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalHeaven">Valinor</a>, the Trees of Light, were a unique creation of the Vala Yavannah, miraculous even by angelic standards. After Ungoliantë and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Morgoth killed them, she knew she could never again make anything like them. As the Silmarils were created with their light, they could be used to heal the trees, but doing so would destroy them. See the next entry for why that is a problem.
</li><li> The means by which the Silmarils were devised is unknown, nobody knows what they're physically made of, and their maker, Fëanor, insisted that their production was so demanding, physically, psychologically, and spiritually, that to remake them would be impossible, and would produce only flawed imitations, lacking everything that made them special. After the Two Trees are destroyed, the Silmarils really do become irreplaceable — they were created using the Trees' holy light. Then Fëanor's killed and for his crimes he's sentenced never to be reincarnated, so they're <em>really</em> irreplaceable.
</li><li> This even applies to Fëanor himself — he was imbued with such a lifeforce that his mother could never have another child. Having children is much more physically and spiritually draining for elves than for humans, but even so Fëanor's birth was unique. His mother later <em>died</em> <em><strong>in heaven</strong></em>, which should be impossible for elves. And his own uniqueness is the reason he was capable of making things like Silmarils.
</li><li> The white ships of the Teleri are said to be finest ships ever created. The Teleri refuse to loan them to Fëanor (in part because they know he's doing the wrong thing), explicitly stating they are as valuable to them as gems are to the Noldor,, and that they will never be able to recreate vessels such as them. Fëanor then kills them and steals the ships, and after using them burns them. This is one of the many things that he's ultimately damned for.

Not only are they unrepeatable works of superlative craft whose maker is dead, but destroying the One Ring also effectively destroys their <em>other</em> maker. Since Sauron made the One Ring to control the others, their power cannot survive its destruction, and everything that was made or maintained with their power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">will also fade away</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a>:
<ul><li> In the early years of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, numerous writers, most likely inspired by the Death Star, had their stories feature stupidly powerful superweapons of which only one existed, the most maligned of which were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Sun Crusher</a> (capable of destroying an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">entire solar system</a></em>) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Galaxy Gun</a> (capable of firing at anything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">in the entire galaxy</a></em> from a single vantage point). Later books, specifically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a> series, have characters make mention of how useful these various superweapons would be against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Yuuzhan Vong</a>, yet no efforts are made to actually replicate them. The lack of such weaponry under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">the New Republic</a> is actually given an explanation in the oft-maligned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackFleetCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackFleetCrisis">Black Fleet Crisis</a></em>:
<div class="indent"> From the beginning, the New Republic had opted to build a larger number of smaller vessels [...] rather than adopt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">the Imperial</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">design</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">philosophy</a>.

Consequently, [a newly detected SSD] circling N'zoth had anything in the New Republic Fleet badly outgunned.
</div></li><li> If you go by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Outbound Flight</a></em>, decades before the prequel movies Palpatine had a vision of the Yuuzhan Vong and decided a united Empire with superweapons was the best way to fight them, making the Rebellion a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>. Though Han in <em>Destiny's Way</em> points out that superweapons as built by the Empire were little more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">colossal wastes</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">of resources</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">stupid names</a>, and Pellaeon points out to a subordinate in another book that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> couldn't handle the Rebellion, what makes them think they would be that much more effective against the Vong?
</li><li> Later media set in the Clone Wars period also features weapons that, while not capable of disintegrating a planet, are still significantly powerful enough to be built more than once, such as the Dark Reaper (a weapons platform that kills anyone who approaches it), the Seismic Tank (a massive floating fortress that crushes any forces beneath it) and the Malevolence (a vessel comparable in size to a Super Star Destroyer capable of destroying entire fleets by itself).
<ul><li> The Dark Reaper was not actually built by the Separatist and instead was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> from the Great Sith and seeing as Anakin learned a way to negate to not be killed when approaching it is likely Dooku didn't see it to be worth it to dig up a second one. A better example from the same would the Protodeka which was justified as it only saw a limited production due to how expensive it was to build and the original creator was captured shortly after the events of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Incidentally, the Death Star <em>itself</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInImitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInImitation">is actually an</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInImitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInImitation">aversion</a></em>, with this class of superweapon being the threat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">two</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">movies</a>, and various blueprints and "proto-concepts" floating around various EU works <em>before</em> being featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>. Indeed, the same trilogy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">that introduced the Sun Crusher</a> also had a Death Star <em>prototype</em> (about 1/4th the size and Superlaser only). The Hutts even made an attempt to build something based on Death Star plans. Ultimately, the impracticality of these superweapons is the main reason why everyone doesn't have one.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em> it's found that the threats of the first four books—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks">D'vouran</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">zombies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatYouFear">the Nightmare Machine</a>—were, though all useful in themselves, intended as sort of high-level concept testing for the <em>real</em> purpose of Project Starscream, creating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">Ultimate Life Form</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">All Your Powers Combined</a>. Each of those ended up being destroyed or neutralized by the protagonists, and notes get destroyed all along the line. Studying the zombiemaking notes is actually how one of our heroes came up with a countermeasure.
</li><li> The Sun Crusher is actually aversion. It had only one prototype because it was ludicrously expensive. The prototype eventually gets dumped into a black hole, pretty much the most decisive way there is to destroy something. The secret base at which it was designed and built is destroyed, and most likely the plans are lost with it. Most of the design team is killed, and the only survivor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">has all her memories of it erased</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>. The Sun Crusher's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">ludicrously durable armor</a> does get duplicated later, but apparently it's still so outlandishly expensive that only a handful of small vehicles utilize it.
</li><li> A sad example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsKenobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsKenobi">Star Wars: Kenobi</a></em>: One particular moisture vaporator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiraculousMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiraculousMalfunction">had its settings tinkered with once</a>, and began producing water so sweet and delicious that it significantly enriches the fortunes of the Dannar's Claim general store. No one can figure out how it's making such incredible water on a desert planet, and attempts to replicate the results have yielded only partial success, in part because no one wants to mess with it too much in case the settings are lost. And then the Sand People raid the store and attack the vaporator to get at the loudspeaker at its top. The machine is repairable, but the formula is destroyed forever.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish">James Blish</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelcomeToMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WelcomeToMars">Welcome To Mars</a></em>, the protagonist built an antigravity drive in his garage, so he built a homebrew spacecraft and got himself stranded on Mars (which was a less hostile environment than we later discovered). Eventually he was rescued by a ship with another antigravity drive. Since he'd already done it, the engineers who made the second drive knew it must have been possible.

Once Cavor's been lost on the Moon and his planet-hopping sphere's likewise lost in space, the secret to making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">gravity-blocking metal</a> Cavorite is lost forever until, as Cavor says, someone else rediscovers it entirely by accident. This is in spite of Cavor working for years on it, in spite of the extensive blueprints and notes that are mentioned, despite his plans to submit his research to a scientific journal, and in spite of the heroes having left for the Moon with Cavor's research lab intact.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Last Hero</em> by Leslie Charteris, the Saint engineers the assassination of a weapons designer who had created a sort of death cloud device. However, we do not find out what happened to a prototype death cloud machine seen earlier in the novel, nor what, if anything, the Saint did with the plans for the machine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <em>biologista</em> Quara keeps her notes on re-engineering the descolada into a more benign form in her head so that the (near-omniscient) AI Jane can't find them — but mostly just to be a bitch.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a>: The Subtle Knife</em>: Mary Malone goes to great lengths to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroy all of the existing equipment necessary to facilitate communication between humans and angels</span>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, Leonard of Quirm both subverts this trope and plays it straight. He frequently creates brilliant inventions, such as coffee makers, helicopters, bicycles, <strike>guns</strike> gonnes, submarines, and nuclear bombs, complete with detailed diagrams and a list of parts. He goes into such detail because they're supposed to be "mental exercises," and omitting the details would be <em>cheating</em>. Fortunately, he is kept under lock and key by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Lord Vetinari</a>, who recognizes the dangerous potential of his inventions and keeps them away from the populace.
<ul><li> The Gonne deserves special mention — the self-aware prototype invoked this trope because it didn't <em>want</em> to be reproduced.
</li><li> In fact, Leonard designed his prison himself and is shown in <em>Jingo</em> to be more or less free to come and go as he pleases. His hideously destructive designs are intended for constructive purposes (mining, hunting dangerous animals) and he's always immensely disappointed that people want to use them otherwise and is grateful to Vetinari for the opportunity to be sequestered in a light, airy space with plenty of paper and modeling material.
</li><li> The fact that he leaves gratuitous plans around means that this is actually a subversion.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack">Repairman Jack</a></em> novel, a group of pharmacists produce a drug from the monster the Rakoshi. However, due to the mystical aspect of the Rakoshi, the substance turns inert after roughly one month. Moreover, all records of the chemical structure of the substance, whether on computer or hard copy form, would change to match the inert form. Therefore, once Repairman Jack engineers the deaths of the pharmacists, all records of the substance literally disappear. (Somewhat of an unusual example, since this story explicitly involved mystical forces.)
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s short story <em>The Dead Past</em>. At the end of the story, the creator of a machine for seeing into the past is convinced by a government agent that it will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">end society as we know it</a>, and agrees to destroy it... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then his research assistant confesses that he's already published details of how to make the thing in several scientific journals.</span>
<ul><li> Doubly subverted because the existing technology is kept under close government control, and the creator mentioned actually tries to <em>recreate</em> it with the little information that is publicly available — and makes it better than the original version. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact that it doesn't even work for his intended purposes, looking into "The Dead Past" of Carthago, is the reason why the technology is under wraps.

</li><li> Another Asimov story involved a robot designed to operate a mining laser getting lost and being found by an ordinary man. The robot then builds a mining laser out of various junk found in the man's toolshed. The only named part is a flashlight. When the robot turns on the laser, he takes out a nearby mountain. The human orders the robot to destroy the machine and then to forget everything. When the owners of the robot find it, they are outraged — the robot had somehow managed to build a laser strong enough to take out a mountain that was powered <em>by a pair of flashlight batteries</em>, and with the robot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant">having followed the order</a>, they couldn't reconstruct it.
</li><li> And another Asimov story, "Light Verse" involved a roboticist who was trying to find a method to make beautiful light sculptures. He received an invite to a famous sculpture artist's party. On the way in, he notices and repairs a robot who only seemed to function as a coat rack. The artist is furious because that robot created the sculptures, and she murders the roboticist. He is said to have welcomed death when he find he missed his chance by repairing rather than studying the robot.
</li><li> In "The Dying Night", a man who invented a teleporter dies of a heart attack. The device, being a prototype, has burned out after a single test, and another man destroyed his notes, with the film upon which he copied them ending up sunburned. Ultimately subverted, however, when the investigator points out that the person's brain can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe">probed</a> for the image of the notes.
</li><li> In the "Norby the Mixed-Up Robot" novellas, the unusually advanced robot Norby was built by a reclusive, half-mad, and now deceased asteroid miner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> using unreproducible parts he found in the wreck of an ancient alien spaceship</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Heechee technology in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederikPohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederikPohl">Frederik Pohl</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeecheeSaga">Heechee Saga</a></em> novels, especially <em>Gateway</em>. They are alien artifacts and technology, of there is no documentation nor manuals, and of which is only known that they work. Attempting to use them is insanely dangerous gamble, and attempts to reverse engineer them lead only in explosion.
</li><li> <em>Divide and Conquer</em>, one of many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> novels (yes, they exist), subverts this. Lots of trouble ensues because Cobra was just as happy to have the huge bulky disintegration ray as they were to have the small portable version. Things went blooey just as well with either one. There was almost a mutiny when one of the Cobra lieutenants guarding the device decides he wants to rule everything and will zap those who disagree.
</li><li> Subverted in the Helen McCloy novel <em>The Imposter</em>. The plot involves an attempt to fashion a laser with greater power and capability. At one point, the heroine points out that scientific research normally operates as a cooperative effort. The person speaking to her acknowledges this, but notes that for the purpose of secrecy, only five people worked on the laser project, so their elimination kept it secret. When someone later points out that destroying the prototype laser would do no good, since someone will inevitably follow the chain of research and stumble upon the way to make it anyway ("Because other researchers will discover it again at any moment? Why do you think Darwin and Wallace discovered evolution at the same time?"), the heroine responds that even the delay that destroying the prototype could produce might prove useful ("...a cipher can't hide a military secret forever, but it can delay discovery long enough to change the course of history").
</li><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaleBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaleBrown">Dale Brown</a> novels. After Patrick McLanahan makes off with the Soviet Fisikous-170 stealth plane in <em>Night of the Hawk</em>, we learn in the later book <em>Warrior Class</em> that the Russians held onto the technology and used it to build a second plane, the Fisikous/Metyor-179.
</li><li> Subverted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> called <em>Vendetta</em>. It turns out that the superweapon encountered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original series crew</a> in the episode "The Doomsday Machine" was actually a prototype that was only sent out because its creators were facing total defeat. Fast forward to the novel, where somebody has located the much more powerful finished product and puts it into action.
</li><li> Played quite straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cetaganda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cetaganda">Cetaganda</a></em>, in which the eponymous planet's rulers keep their genetic records (necessary to continue "improving" the race) in <em>one</em> facility with exactly <em>one</em> key to unlock the genome. No backup records. No backup key. The protagonist, offworlder Miles Vorkosigan, learns this secret and bursts out, "Are you people <em>insane</em>?" This was sort-of justified in that the Cetagandans reasoned that if they only <em>have</em> one facility with one key, then they only have to <em>guard</em> one facility with one key. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They actually got away with it until, ironically, an attempt to <em>create</em> backups provided an opening for someone to steal the key.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> liked to play with this one. In general he averted this trope, because he was pretty damn hard on the Mohs scale of hardness, so his scientists (typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> eggheads) realistically kept detailed notes and communicated with each other, but sometimes...

They refuse to believe that the Howards are the result of a selective breeding program and they demand the non-existent secret. The families steal a space ship and flee to the stars. Not finding any suitable habitats, they decide to return to Earth and demand their homes back, only to discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that humanity has spent the intervening decades discovering the secret the Howards did, in fact, have. Unfortunately, the Howard scientists hadn't taken it far enough and discarded it as an unworkable technique</span>.
</li><li> In order to justify some of his later, softer technologies, Heinlein came up with the phlebotinum of Shipstones, basically awesome batteries that recharge themselves using cosmic radiation, invented by a guy named Shipstone. There are plans, there was a prototype, and there aren't just back-ups, they're produced on an assembly line! However, the process for how they're made is a closely guarded secret (the inventor didn't even patent the technology, as that would require putting schematics on public record) so that he can maintain a monopoly, and somehow no one can reverse engineer them (they tend to explode if anyone tries).
</li><li> Completely averted again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixthColumn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixthColumn">Sixth Column</a></em>: the scientist who created the initial radiation-emitting device of the heroes was <em>killed by it in a test run before the start of the book</em>, but the prototype and the notes remained, and the scientists who survived the test used the notes to make a directed version (essentially a beam gun) before they started developing variants.
</li><li> Played straight in his short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gulf">Gulf</a>" (1949). The "nova effect" was a scientific means of turning a planet into a nova and thus destroying it (it's described as a "plutonium, lithium, and heavy water deal", so it's yet another successful Heinlein prediction - this time, of the hydrogen bomb). After it was developed on the Moon, all of the documents used to create it were destroyed and everyone involved in creating it received hypnotic instructions to forget about it. Two sets of microfilms were made: one was to be taken to Earth for safe keeping, and a backup version was to be destroyed once the first set was safe. After a secret agent arrived on Earth with the first set the order was given to destroy the backups. Unfortunately the agent was pursued by the enemy and had to get rid of the first set before he could deliver them, and they were lost.

The eponymous time machine doesn't have any blueprints, but the main character who built does remember how it was made and quickly makes up a copy. Unfortunately, it doesn't work (or, at least, it doesn't act as a time machine. It simply works as a photon source which the original machine was supposed to be). Once the character arrives sixteen years in the future, and his professor published all his notes and has received the Nobel Prize in Physics, there are over a thousand copies of the machine in existence... which all also don't work.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> with the Anti-Morphing Ray. The kids realize, early on, that simply destroying the device won't be enough — the Yeerks will only build another one. They decide, instead, to first convince them that it doesn't work and that the project should be abandoned, and then "accidentally" destroy it for good measure. It doesn't go exactly the way they planned it would. Because it's <em>Animorphs</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darwath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darwath">Darwath</a></em> is your standard Dark Age/Medieval world, and so far as we know from the few glimpses we get, was much the same when it was first attacked by Lovecraftian Monsters From The Deeps. Then the King called together the greatest mages and they created the Keep of Dare — a multi-storey arcology of fused stone with artificial light, piped water, air conditioning and hydroponics gardens, where all the survivors of the first attacks could live in safety till the monsters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> went back underground</span>. Whereupon everyone emerged... and went back to the same primitive level of technology as before, and left the Keep forgotten for the next <em>three thousand years</em> till the monsters return and they suddenly realise they need it again. Granted, there was a religious pogrom against wizards and all their works, but the idea that in all the subsequent millenia no rebel thinker ever bothered to explore the place and think 'Hey, I could use that trick,' carries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> to absurdity.
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a> detective story "ARM". A key plot element is an experimental machine that accelerates time in a localized bubble. The detective realizes that since the machine they see is all smoothly-built, with a nice plastic casing and no loose wires, there must have been a version 0.9 that worked pretty much as well but wasn't so nicely put-together (and which was stolen from the lab after the murder).
</li><li> Subverted in <em>He, She and It</em>. An experimental robot decides that its kind shouldn't exist, so it kills its creator and destroys his lab, and then blows up itself. However, another character later realizes that she has backup copies of the plans on her computer, and could probably figure out how to build it again if she wanted to.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenWorldsCollide">When Worlds Collide</a></em>; the builders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArk">The Ark</a> build several test vehicles to try out their atomic engines, and when they complete the first ship early, they immediately start work on a second, larger one for the rest of the construction team. In addition, other countries are building their own ships.

Mr. Curtain has gone to great pains to protect it and it would take a long time to rebuild it if it were destroyed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrontierMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrontierMagic">Frontier Magic</a></em> series has an interesting variation: The creators of the Great Barrier Spell left behind plenty of documentation on their legendary spell, but since Benjamin Franklin was self-educated and Thomas Jefferson had an unfortunate tendency to assume that everyone else was as well read as him, their notes are so idiosyncratic that nobody else can understand them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PreludeToDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PreludeToDune">Prelude to Dune</a></em> prequels, a Richese scientist invents the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">no-field</a> and builds the Baron his personal no-chamber and a small no-ship.

However, no one bothers to have him teach someone how to build more of these (in fairness to Rabban, he <em>thought</em> they had what they needed to reconstruct the ship with recordings of everything the scientist did while in the Harkonnen's employ. Unfortunately, the scientist had anticipated what would happen to him unless he was still needed and so had taken measures to keep the recordings as useless as possible — and even more unfortunately for him no-one with the scientific or engineering expertise to realize this looked at the recordings until <em>after</em> he was killed). So when Rabban stupidly ends up getting the no-ship destroyed, the Baron berates him for eliminating the scientist. It later turns out that there <em>are</em> plans back on the research space station orbiting Richese, and a number of his colleagues discover them and try to recreate the technology. The station is blown up by the Sardaukar on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>'s orders as punishment for the Richese stockpiling spice. Thanks to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> on the station, the nuclear explosion ends up blinding half the population of the planet below. It's not until thousands of years later that the technology is rediscovered (possibly independently, although the Bene Gesserit are known to have studied the crashed no-ship before burning it). The technology is further improved to make it immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> (this was a big flaw of the original no-ship, as the Bene Gesserit saw right through the cloak).

<ul><li> One notable incident is the Ancients' attempt to extract zero-point energy from their own universe, in comparison to ZPM power which extracts said energy from a much smaller pocket universe. The problem was that doing so created exotic particles which inevitably caused the energy extraction to spiral out of control, creating deadly radiation and ultimately resulting in explosive failure. This one project and its offshoots become a recurring plot device.
</li><li> The process is duplicated on Atlantis in the next season, this time using a matter bridge to extract power from an alternate universe instead of their own to get around the instability. It technically worked, but that universe complained about their near-annihilation and it was shelved.
</li><li> An alternate universe Sam Carter further refined the technique to grab power from multiple universes, minimizing the damage to any one, but that too failed when the main universe Sam Carter's phasing experiment interacted with it, zapping her over to that universe and killing the alternate Carter in the process.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusmansHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusmansHoliday">Busman's Holiday</a> episode in season 5, McKay spends some time on Earth and is invited to a presentation by his old nemesis — who has gotten his hands on the secret paper Rodney wrote about the matter bridge project. He figured out that using it as a massive heat sink would avoid the exotic particle problem. While he did avoid that problem, the instability of the matter bridge, coupled with the fact that they couldn't turn it off, threatened to drain all the heat from the planet, and McKay has to save the day.
</li><li> One gets the sense that ZPMs themselves must be this. A large percentage of the series' tension comes from the expedition's inability to properly power the city. Meanwhile they have access to The Ancient's entire database, as well as every bit of technology in the city. One would assume the blueprints for The Ancient's primary power source should be in their database, and that the facility to manufacture them would be in their capital and only ship they originally used to travel from the Milky Way to Pegasus to begin with. Instead they're treated like mystical irreplaceable artifacts, and not even the best scientific minds and engineers so much as bring up the possibility of simply manufacturing new ones. To say nothing of building more Chair Drones, Puddle Jumpers, or even Aurora Class ships.
<ul><li> Justified in that the Ancient database is very large, to the point that even the almost-equally-advanced Asgard haven't fully translated their copy of it yet; likely the instructions to create a ZPM <em>are</em> available but nobody's found them yet.
</li><li> Also, it's pointed out that Atlantis is roughly the size of Manhattan and it will take the expedition <em>decades</em> to fully explore and document everything. Which is not made easier by the measures the Ancients took to prevent the Wraith from being able to occupy the city, erasing records and such. So the ZPM factory is probably in the city somewhere but it may take years to locate and determine the function.

</li><li> The Cardassian Obsidian Order develops a device that is designed to prevent a changeling from changing its molecular structure, trapping it in its current form until it crumbles apart.

However, with the passing of his creator Dr. Soong, no one is quite able to construct Soong-type androids. Even Data himself can't quite get it right, though he came remarkably close by building a viable "daughter". She eventually broke down, but the fact that she ran as long as she did is a far sight better than Starfleet ever managed. Judging by the fact that Starfleet at one point attempts to acquire (or, to put it less charitably, enslave) Data for the purpose of backwards engineering him, one assumes that Dr. Soong left behind no plans or blueprints, since otherwise Starfleet could have just undergone construction of androids based on any such plans. Of course it's slightly more justified since the colony Soong was living in was completely wiped out by the Crystalline Entity and Soong was later shown to be super secretive about his work.

He is only one copy of many, but since <em>Voyager</em> is stranded in the Delta Quadrant, they neither have access to spare copies or the person who designed the program (at least not until late in the series). Furthermore, they can't simply make a backup of him in case of emergency (save one episode which introduced an until-then unmentioned backup device, which aliens stole), so any threat to his program is serious. Theoretically, any EMH could become as complex as he is, but as the the E stands for "emergency," no other EMHs have been left on long enough for this to happen.

With his partner dead, Finch is the only person with the slightest idea how the thing works (The audience is occasionally informed of various places it gets data from, but not how it compiles the information), and since the government may not even know he <em>exists</em>, there's no way they could make another Machine if something happens to the original. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Season 3 reveals that there <em>is</em> a backup - there was a second team independently working on the same project, which was shut down the day after the Machine caught it's first terrorist.

Season 4 reveals that the Machine was actually the <em>forty-third</em> AI that Finch built, and that he deliberately destroyed the forty-two prototypes the moment he saw any sign that they might go out of control.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> tabletop game, the open warfare of the Succession Wars was so destructive, with so many factories, shipyards, and research facilities targeted that many of the most advanced technologies were lost for centuries before a Star League Memory Core (basically a supercomputer database) was accidentally discovered.
<ul><li> There were two other big reasons for the loss of technology during the Succession Wars: first was that the Terran Hegemony had been the most technologically advanced state and aggressively guarded its superiority to control the other states in the Inner Sphere. Between the massive destruction caused by the war when the Hegemony's ruler was assassinated and the subsequent destruction after the Succession Wars broke out in the wake of the Hegemony's collapse, many research and construction facilities that built the most high tech equipment were destroyed. Second, the quasi-religious organization Comstar had for centuries the practice of carrying out false flag operations to assassinate scientists and destroy research facilities (and provoke more wars) as a means of hastening the Inner Sphere's collapse into barbarism.

It's suggested that the actual artifact is not the Apparatus itself, but the notebooks that describe its construction.
</li><li> A sourcebook on the drow explains that they're much more technologically-inclined than surface elves, since their natural magic resistance has taught them not to rely on spells over tools, and their ambition and tendency towards conflict drives them to innovate as much as humans. Over their history, drow inventors have come up with clockwork timepieces, moveable type, blackpowder, even steam-powered pistons. Unfortunately, a society defined by scheming, infighting and paranoia means that few drow innovators risk writing things down or sharing their breakthroughs, meaning the aforementioned technology has been lost and rediscovered over and over again.

One of his prizes is Tesla's electrotherapy cure for cancer.

I'd expect Sorin would have had to give up something very dear to him in order to bring together the magics required <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to create Avacyn</span>, in addition to mana and power, just like Liliana needed big-time demonic help to ensure her lasting power and youth. Even though Sorin probably rated a solid "nutso" on the power-ometer before the Great Mending, he had to bring in the thaumaturgical Big Guns and do something that wasn't in the manual. Maybe he had to tap into knowledge that didn't even exist anywhere on any plane, using overlapping arcano-theologies drawn from his restless travels across many worlds. Perhaps Sorin had to break off a little, unrecoverable piece of himself and give it to his creation in order to give her true, lasting, world-shielding lifeand I don't mean an appendix or a little toe either, but something deeper, stranger, and more precious.

Thus, the holy grail for techno-archeologists are the Standard Template Construct systems, relics from the Dark Age of Technology that were meant to catalogue all of humanity's technological knowledge in a way that they could be reproduced anywhere, using whatever local resources were available. Finding a complete STC is unheard of, but just fragments of hard copies of STC data are immensely valuable, and are the source of some of the Imperium's mainstay war machines like the Leman Russ battle tank and the Land Raider transport. Or to put it another way, two Imperial scouts who discovered an STC design for a superior combat knife were given their own planet. Each.
</li><li> Even if the Imperium <em>wanted</em> to create new Primarchs, they cannot. Much of the knowledge of how the Primarchs were created was never recorded by the Emperor, and the Emperor himself was the source of the genetic material. In his current state on the Golden Throne, he's in no condition to donate said genetic material. There have also been hints that the Emperor used the power of the Warp itself to create the Primarchs, meaning they are more than simply products of genetic engineering. Finally, the blueprints for the Immortis Gland that is in the Primarchs were partially lost. What was left of the knowledge was used to create The Magnificat that supercharges the Primaris Marines.

<ul><li> Averted in <em>All Things Devours</em>. You have to destroy a prototype for a device you created, before the people who took over the lab end up running an experiment that will end disastrously. This would be quite straightforward — except that you soon discover your notes are no longer in the same room as the device, and if you don't deal with them as well, they can just build another one.
</li><li> Interesting one; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode">Another Code</a>'s</em> "Another I" unit was actually the prototype of Another II — of course this was only revealed in the second game. Whilst it technically isn't considered a weapon (because it wasn't intended as one) there are some very bad people out there who would like to use this as one. Despite them being untested and in development, the first time they're used, they work perfectly.

When Leonardo tasks Ezio with destroying the war machines the Borgia forced him to build, you not only have to destroy the prototype, you need to burn the blueprints too, and often there will be a backup copy of the war machine that also needs to be wrecked.
<ul><li> When destroying the tank (a wooden, circular steam-powered vehicle bristling with cannons), Ezio has to pilot one of the prototypes to destroy the others.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a>, Leonardo tells Ezio that he deliberately introduced flaws into the designs of all these weapons, so the Borgia wouldn't be able to use them to their fullest extent. However, even his new wheel-lock guns (which are still inferior to Ezio's gun) prove to be quite effective in the hands of the Borgia.

Some, like the <em>Manhattan Project</em> found in all versions, subvert this in a way: if the Manhattan Project is finished, <em>every</em> civ (with the other requirements like Rocketry) can then build nukes.

One of two possible objectives you get for a level in the Nod campaign, Kane either sends you out to kill the head scientist of GDI's ion cannon project, or go and blow up their prototype Mammoth Tanks to keep them from being mass produced. In either case, your actions don't prevent both weapons from appearing later in the campaign.

This time, it's explicitly stated it won't stop the project entirely (since the GDI still have plans for it), but it will delay it enough to be worth the effort. Although it never really reaches full production due to costs and technical issues (i.e. you can't build more than one at a time). Then, by the time of the next war, they retire the design as costly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, going to back to good ol' treaded tanks.

Mission 13 is about destroying the new Iron Curtain research facility, including the Iron Curtain prototype — after which the Soviets are unable to get it operational again before they lose the war. Then, in the sequel, the Iron Curtain is in use. With the nuclear weapons, it was explicitly a case of "more can always be made, but those were all they had on hand and we just crippled their primary production facility, so we've bought time to win the war."

Attempts at analyzing the code just leave confusion and trying to surgically remove any part of the program to see what breaks brings the whole thing to a standstill.
<ul><li> The developers of The World:R2 knew they could never recreate Harald's genius so most of what they did was just vaguely based on the Harald Files, at least until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they recovered all eight of the Phases and attempted to recreate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">Morganna Gone Mode</a></span>.

When the Darkspawn attacked the lost thaigs, the Dwarves were too busy fighting, dying, and running for their lives to bring plans and backups with them. The Anvil of the Void, the key to making Golems, was the brainchild of the Paragon Smith Caridin and only he knew its secrets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is unfortunately averted with the Harvester in <em>Golems of Amgarrak</em>. There are still <em>dozens</em> of them left.</span>
<ul><li> In Caridin's case, he purposely destroyed his research after suffering a crisis of conscience, coming to realise how horrific his "masterpiece" truly was.

Played straight in the sense that Bianca <em>is</em> unique and one-of-a-kind, however Varric is still asked why her creator did not try to make more. Varric's answer is, to put it simply, if every army had an arsenal of Biancas to tote around, battles would be a whole lot bloodier. What he <em>tells</em> people is that the creator (whose identity varies with the telling) could never figure out why his worked and their other attempts failed.
</li><li> The super-suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a> was designed by Professor Monkey-For-A-Head, originally for the villain of the series. The manual states that he could have made another one... if the damn monkey hadn't eaten the blueprints. Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim">the cartoon</a>. Turns out the professor <em>can</em> build another suit, but since the power source literally came from the Gods, and they ain't eager to give him another one, any suit he builds would be pretty weak.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessSpace">Endless Space</a></em> has this crop up in a strange way: in the distant future, we'll only be able to store 10 ship family designs. You may delete a ship blueprints to make room for new ones, but then <em>that entire ship family cannot be built or upgraded ever again</em>. Besides those, you can upgrade any version of a ship to the most modern if it's docked at one of your planets, meaning you can upgrade a several-hundred-year-old ship for just a little extra money than a year-old ship.
<ul><li> Some random events create "Advanced Defenders", ships that are powerful in the very early game but can never be upgraded, due to the same mechanic of not having blueprints for them, to the point that they're hilariously underarmored, outgunned, and slow even by the mid-game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a> Override</em> gives a slightly more positive spin to the 'ominous statement about nothing hindering the villains from building another' with the Voinian <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dreadnaught</span>. After its destruction, Admiral McPherson acknowledges that the Voinians of course could build more of them... but given the necessary effort and resources, that will take time, giving the United Earth the opportunity to consider ways to counter it more permanently in the meantime rather than the desperate scramble destroying the first one was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> had it that the Voinians did indeed deploy more <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dreadnaughts</span> eventually, but that at that point the UE was stronger strategically (the frontier is pushed significantly closer to Voinia in the UE storylines, and several important resource-extraction worlds are denied to the Voinians), militarily (the UE was able to use the aforementioned as well as a number of other factors to expand and upgun its fleet) and technologically (plenty of Voinian technology was reverse-engineered, and mutually beneficial commercial ties were established with a friendlier advanced alien society), leaving it rather less of a war-winner than the Voinians had hoped for.
</li><li> Appropriately played straight and then subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, high-tech gear like powered armor is rare and largely irreplaceable, and must be maintained vigilantly. Then the Enclave show up, having survived the apocalypse with all their technological data and manufacturing facilities intact, and are actually wielding weapons and armor <em>more</em> advanced than the pre-war models. Lots of them.
<ul><li> And then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> comes around (which is set in the east coast, rather than the west coast) and you'll find power armor and rare plasma and laser weapons wherever you look. Though oddly, the Enclave's previously superior armor is suddenly inferior to the pre-War models, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">despite the most common Fallout 3 power armor being a step back from what could be found on the West Coast</a>.
<ul><li> The reason that T-45d power armor (The stuff the East Coast Brotherhood uses) was considered inferior to later models was because the suits had a couple of drawbacks: Their servo systems weren't quite up to scratch so they were bulky and hard to move around in (represented in game as a -2 penalty to your agility); had problems with heat dissipation; Various electronic and mechanical subsystems of the armor were exposed on the outside of the casing, making it far more susceptible to damage (the condition deteriorates faster than Enclave armor); and the suits also burnt through energy cells like a gas-guzzling SUV (thankfully, you don't have to worry about that issue).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> fixes the power armor issue. The old-gen (Mk1) Enclave power armor (the stock variety from 2) has the best DT of any armor that made it into the final game. The Mk2 armor (from 2 &amp; 3) has one less DT than the Mk1, by which I mean, the Mk2 armor <em>itself</em> has nearly the same DT as the <em>set</em> of Mk1 armor. The Mk2 didn't into the final game, but was still included in the game's data files.
<ul><li> <em>New Vegas</em> also makes a major point about how the need to manufacture goods is problematic more than ever as it's pointed out that most pre-war locations have been picked bone dry.
</li><li> <em>New Vegas</em> also averts this with some of its more conventional weapons The NCR relies on primarily Pre-War weaponry (such as wooden-furniture AR-15s, M1 Garands, and Browning Hi Powers) rather than the more advanced technology the Enclave, Brotherhood, and even some Raiders favor. It's implied, however, companies within the NCR are still reproducing a lot of their weaponry; the Hi Power, for instance, is made by a company called M&amp;A and, since <em>Fallout Tactics</em> confirms Browning exists in the <em>Fallout</em> universe and did make a Hi Power themselves, one can safely assume M&amp;A's model is a reproduction, albeit one seeing front-line combat use.
</li><li> The game also averts with the companion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">ED-E</a>. He is one of the prototypes and his creator uploaded the plans to his memory banks when the project that created him was cancelled by the Enclave <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one ending to the game has the Brotherhood Of Steel mass producing him if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">The Courier</a> allowed to recover the plans from ED-E</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>. The technologically-advanced Bevelle was able to construct a prototype superweapon supposedly capable of taking down Zanarkand's Sin... but the weapon, Vegnagun, went sentient and became unable to recognize friend from foe. Instead of risking annihilating themselves by activating it, the leaders of Bevelle sealed it away deep within the city, and the Church of Yevon became its keeper. Naturally, no other attempts were made, especially as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Church of Yevon <em>needs</em> Sin, and wouldn't want to create something capable of destroying it</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3">Front Mission 3</a></em> plays this trope worryingly straight, as the MIDAS weapon (think "nuclear bomb without the nuclear") is <em>stolen</em> tech. The technology was originally intended as an energy source, but when it was discovered that it could be used as a weapon, numerous countries jumped at the chance to obtain or recreate it. Just the weapon, no notes. The main characters are witnesses to a failed reproduction of it (which <em>works</em>), and are on the run from the military as a result. There are only two people in the world who know how to recreate it, and one of the two ends up in your party depending on which one's storyline you choose. The main villain of the game is less than pleased that neither will share their knowledge, so in one storyline he obtains the knowledge by coercing one of them.

<ul><li> It also helps that REX was in itself already a knock-off of Metal Gear Mk. 1 and Metal Gear D from the first two MSX <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> games.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em>, we have the Tani-Oh, a gargantuan land master and boss of mission 3. According to the additional info provided by SNK, the Tani-Oh was actually a prototype that was being tested in the mountain range. The tank was subsequently destroyed by the peregrine FALCONS before it could be mass produced. Note this does not apply to other creations of the Rebel Army: The Iron Nokana, a rusty armored carrier and boss of Mission 6, has appeared a few other times in the series.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series always involves lead character Samus collecting items for her Power Suit. She is able to equip a wide variety of Chozo artifacts, including the Morph Ball, the Screw Attack, and various armor upgrades (including the Varia and Gravity suits). Despite the fact that she has collected these items multiple time overs in the course of the game series, and has interacted with Federation scientists and soldiers (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3">Metroid Prime 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>), no one has been able to replicate her upgrades for use successfully with their soldiers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirate</a> race has (according to logs found in <em>Prime</em>) tried to back-engineer the Morph Ball, but those experiments killed many of the subjects on which the prototypes were tested. As of now, the Chozo artifacts are still only compatible with Samus' suit.
<ul><li> Still, the Space Pirates <em>did</em>, in fact, manage to reverse-engineer Samus' various beam weapons, and her Thermal Visor seems to be a Pirate creation. It seems that the Pirates probably had the wrong idea of how Samus goes into her Morph Ball.
</li><li> On the other hand, there is at least one "backup" to the technology, albeit one that borders on the mystical. When her original was destroyed during a crash landing near the end of <em>Zero Mission</em>, she was able to find a new and improved one at the Chozo ruins of her childhood.
</li><li> Later entries in the series tried to explain this away by stating that Samus' Power Suit is a specially modified version of a Chozo Battlesuit, linked to her unique biology (part Human, part Chozo) and made of refined Unobtanium, since the creators (the Chozo) were a technologically super-advanced race who up and disappeared less than twenty years ago (when they were <em>still</em> super-advanced compared to everyone else). Also, the Galactic Federation has been able to design weapons based on Samus' suit, including upgrades for her suit, most notably the Diffusion Missile technology from <em>Metroid Fusion</em>.
</li><li> The <em>Metroid</em> series in general is very good about this. The Chozo seem to have backups <em>everywhere</em>, but in a way that only they can use them. Despite this, the Pirates and Federation have at least attempted to recreate them. The Pirates ended up with weaker beams immediately, and the Federation got some really good missile systems after a few years. Everyone has a Chozo door system, however. On their own, the Pirates have been able to recreate everything they've stolen, and the Federation keeps backups of Metroid DNA and whatever else was on BSL (they probably have more).
<ul><li> During the <em>Prime</em> series of games, you frequently attack Space Pirate bases conducting research into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Phazon-enhanced supersoldiers</a>. The bases are filled with failed or developing experiments and computer records. Destroying not only the successful experiments, but the entire bases and research team merely sets back the research, and other stations find new applications for Phazon to try and kill you with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Concept Art</a> shows very bulky Federation power suits that are apparently too expensive to deploy in vast numbers. A version of these suits would later enter use in <em>Federation Force</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Metroid Prime Hunters</em>, Sylux had a power suit that was stolen from the galactic federation that allowed him to transform into its second form, Lockjaw, which used a compression technology similar to the morph ball. The same could be said for the other hunters, but the secondary forms of the rest are all part of their biology, save for Weavel who splits himself in two. Sylux's prototype suit would indicate that the Galactic Federation has been doing some research into morph ball technology as well.
</li><li> Also in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a> there is a "blue Samus," he was a GF marine but died, so apparently the Chozo suit was recreated but was a inferior copy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Big Guy</a> Anthony Higgs wields a Federation-issued Plasma Rifle. It's twice as long as he is tall, and takes about 10 seconds to charge up enough energy to fire a single shot.

The Federation is reverse engineering Samus' weaponry, they're just nowhere close to the Chozo's level.
</li></ul></li><li> An unfortunate real-life example with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a> Saga</em>. According to the developers, the original source code is lost, shooting down any chances for a port (meantime, the game remains the rarest and most valuable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Saturn</a> game.)
</li><li> <em>Parasol Souls</em> was a spin-off to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BubbleBobble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BubbleBobble">Bubble Bobble</a></em> released for a number of consoles in the early 90's. The exception to this was the Commodore 64. It was going to be ported the system but Ocean, who had the publishing rights to the Commodore, handed it to an external programmer since it was near the end of the C64's lifespan and they didn't want to divert a team to make the port. There are two official stories as to why this port was cancelled.
<ul><li> The <em>official</em> reason is the straight example - the programmer's computer was stolen in a break-in. The game was nearly complete and since it was so close to the projected release date they decided to cancel the game instead. This led to collectors searching for the fabled computer with the C64 port in vain, until the truth came out...
</li><li> The actual reason is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> - after an argument with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholic</a> wife about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexWithTheEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexWithTheEx">affair with her ex-husband</a>, she destroyed everything related to his work, including his computer and the notes related to the game. The subversion is that the programmer <em>did</em> have backups to all of his work. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> is that she knew about them and where they all were! When the programmer explained what happened, Ocean made up the above story in solidarity to the man's failing marriage.

It appears someone at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> eventually did ask about this, because supplementary materials in subsequent games reveal that the Nemesis was incredibly expensive to produce and considered a failure (it <em>did</em> fail to kill one of its targets), leading Umbrella to pull the plug. Another problem was that Nemesis was <em>too</em> smart. One prototype (mentioned in side materials) gained enough self-awareness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">rebel</a>; while the "finished product" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake">remake</a> is sadistic and arrogant, to the point that he deliberately toys with Jill instead of killing her as soon as he can.

<ul><li> Additionally, a big deal is made over how Grienko (the researcher in charge of the psychic experiments) actually managed to achieve replicable results. In the flashback <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or rather, present day</span> scenes, Grienko himself actually hands a huge ream of files to Vattic and talks of how they contain detailed and comprehensive notes on his methods at every stage of the process.

Not only is a prototype version seen and actually <em>used</em> against the heroes, but when they steal the ship bearing the completed version, it is explained that it is the first unit of a line of ships, fresh off the shipyards — the rest don't show up because they weren't constructed in time, given the timescale involved. Finally, the Hydra sky fortress is one of a kind due to the fact that the sheer <em>expense</em> involved in constructing it made it utterly economically unfeasible — but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> had one made all the same, out of his own pocket.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> games, it's actually not uncommon for Dr. Eggman or any of his henchbots to haul out old Eggmobiles, bases or the like. As early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> did these things get reused.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, Eggman claims the Egg Dragoon that Werehog Sonic fights is a prototype and that the finished product would be much stronger. Indeed, later versions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em> prove to be much tougher.
</li><li> On the subject of <em>Forces</em>, a Zig Zag of this trope is what leads to the heroes' victory. Eggman made prototype copies of the Phantom Ruby, then tries to make sure those copies are destroyed. Infinite losing one while battling Silver is what allows the heroes to save the day.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>, this is a common problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSparkOfGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSparkOfGenius">Devisors</a>, as their power allows them to violate otherwise rock-solid physical law with their devises - but the further they take it from consensus reality, the more unstable the devises are, and the harder it is to reproduce them even for themselves. Worse, a Devisor with 'The Big Idea', or one in the throes of rage or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">Diedrick's episode</a>, often don't really understand their creations themselves once they are completed. For example, the devise Spark made while she was furious at her boyfriend worked the one time, but doesn't seem to be reproducible. The one-shot forcefield blaster Mega-Death made and sold to Phase worked once, the second one exploded when Phase used it against a PK brick, and Mega-Death hasn't been able to get any new ones to work.
<ul><li> Also, Devises are shown as unpredictable, with one devise having different results each time it's used. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And the third time shows WHY screwing with unproven Devises is a bad idea!</span>
</li><li> While it is difficult, it is sometimes possible to reproduce a Devise as a Gadget (i.e., something extremely advanced but still works within normal physical laws) if it is only bends the laws of reality just a little. The 'Devisor Test' (or 'gadget test') is a process in which a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> tries to replicate a devise within consensus technology; if it succeeds, the devisor gets to share in any resulting patents.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em> this is one of the defining traits of Tinkers. They can create amazing machinery and devices but the individual tinker is usually the only one who has any hope in hell of understanding it enough to reproduce, so most tinker inventions are one-offs. In fact, the reason that Dragon is considered the greatest Tinker alive is explicitly because her inventions <em>aren't</em> like this; her talent is that she can understand other tinkers' work enough to reproduce it in a way that anyone can use or manufacture. This is most prevalent with Leet, whose Tinker power is to be able to make one of <em>anything</em>, and <em>only</em> one of anything. If he tries to make a second one, or even to repair the first one after it gets damaged, it explodes.
</li><li> Radham Academy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twig">Twig</a></em> employs a simple policy with experiments: test to destruction, then make another using what you've learned from that one.

The drill, designed to break through the outer wall of the city-state of Ba Sing Se, is apparently one of a kind; only one ever makes it to the battlefield, with no readily accessible back-up. Considering how effective it was (it only failed because the Avatar and his friends disabled it, and it got through the outer wall before they did), there's no reason they shouldn't try again. This might be justified as a matter of expenditure, given the drill was absolutely massive and probably used the equivalent resources of hundreds of tanks or other more practical war machines for a single campaign. It also had to be built in enemy territory to begin with. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azula conquered the city a few weeks later anyway, eliminating the need for it entirely).</span>
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, Toyman makes an energy cannon that apparently disintegrates Superman before being smashed by the rest of the League (it actually sends him on a one-way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">journey through time</a>). Superman does (thanks to some extraordinary, never-to-be repeated luck) reappear after a few days, but it's still odd that the Toyman didn't build another one and try again. It's commented in the show that Toyman "didn't know what he made" — but isn't knowing that <em>it's a thing that makes Superman disappear for a few days</em> enough? Of course, the implication is that the time machine was an accidental invention, and he can't remember how he created it (because he didn't keep notes; see above).

<ul><li> And he had to use one of the Shen Gong Wu just to have enough power to run the thing effectively.
</li><li> The fact that he needed a Shen Gong Wu that he didn't posses at the time was the main reason he never built a device to forward in time. Without a supply of infinite energy he could only go back a few seconds in time and had no need of a machine to go forward.

This is justified, however, by the fact that several of its parts were salvaged from the remains of an alien invasion, and could not be replicated.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot">Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot</a></em>, there is exactly one BGY-11, and exactly one person who can pilot the mech without accidentally destroying it. It is explained that the military lost the original blueprints, but since they can still perform maintenance on it, it does seem odd that they wouldn't build another one. And there really isn't any logical reason not to train a backup pilot.
<ul><li> Further explained that the US Army promised a <em>working</em> robot and didn't want to admit all they could build was a oversized suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. Thus the reason they don't produce more.
</li><li> In the episode with Po the Conqueror, it's stated that they can build another Big Guy, or at least scrounge one up from spare parts, but the lieutenant was the only person who had any idea how to pilot it. It's later shown that most people know how to get the thing moving (as when he gets dropped back in time and a British soldier managed to pilot it as "Iron Jack") but have no idea about how to regulate the power core from exploding.

Also, despite not being a villain, Professor Utonium seems to suffer from the same work ethic, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> it in the episode "Bubble Boy":
<div class="indent"><strong>Blossom</strong>: "Gee, Professor, you sure outdid yourself this time with that containment ray!" <br/><strong>Professor Utonium</strong>: "I'll say! Once again, I have no idea what I did!"
</div><ul><li> But in Mojo's case, why would you repeat a plan that didn't work the first time. The one time he tries that with the Anubis head, it backfires even worse than just doing the exact same thing he did the first time.
</li><li> Mojo does have some recurring tech, and usually whenever his armory is shown, all of the older tech still remains. This is probably used as a convenient background to show just how much heat he's packing, but is also a bit of fridge brilliance: each and every one of those robots, death rays and other tech are probably prototypes. the only reason he hasn't replicated them yet is because he's still improving them.

Unsurprisingly, because of the attempts of the villains to seize it, his lab is destroyed and he loses his memory, but he promises to start over from nothing. Not to mention the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">vehicles the Planeteers use</a>, despite how much they alone could help the environment are never mass produced (although given they were gifts from Gaia they may be unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>).

It looks like a mistake on the part of the animators until later episodes demonstrate that, while the heroes were captured, the Queen simply made her own backup copy.

Jeremie can only use it once, though, because he doesn't know what keys the candy pressed.

Yumi ends up needing to use it, and Jeremie completes the program permanently later in the season.

Also, the Lyoko-Warriors are very careful to not let the tech fall into wrong hands, so Hopper's supercalculator would most likely be replicable if taken by the army.

Rather than copy this onto paper, they use the chocolate itself, following it while keeping it in an ice cream cart while making attempts on Scrooge's life, which they are forced to stop when their mule eats their slipshod map.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: The heroes steal Grand Admiral Thrawn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> TIE Defender, and it ends up getting destroyed before they can take it apart and study it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">This doesn't slow Thrawn down in the slightest</a>; since he is more interested in efficient supply lines than paranoid limiting of information, all he really needed from the prototype was a proof of concept. Once it was proven to be up to spec, he immediately moved into full production.
</li><li> Both played straight <em>and</em> averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Gemkat 6000 in the episode "Chaos in Crystal." Averted. Not only do blueprints for the machine exist, but Dr. Greenbox was so thorough he had a <em>prototype</em> of his <em>prototype</em> (think the two Cosmic Keys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em>), which he is able to rewire the second machine in order to undo what the first one did.
</li><li> The Behemoth super tank in "Metal Urgency." Played straight. It appears Puma-Dyne made just the one tank, and had no means of remotely shutting it down in the event it gets stolen. Its forcefield and thought-controlled arsenal make it impervious to pretty much everything the Enforcers throw at it... meaning they can't stop a tank <em>designed explicitly for their use</em>.
</li><li> Averted and then played straight with the two Macro-Bots in the same episode. Professor Hackle quit working at Puma-Dyne after they wanted to weaponize two giant space exploration robots he designed. He left the company before the robots could be built, but Puma-Dyne built them anyway, using Hackle's original designs and just adding weaponry to the final product(s). If Hackle didn't want Puma-Dyne to build the Macro-Bots, he shouldn't have left the plans for them with the company. An example of having the plans being a <em>bad</em> thing. But Puma-Dyne being Puma-Dyne, they, again, apparently had no backups or countermeasures to the Macro-Bots prepared in the event that they fell into the wrong hands, so once the Metallikats steal them, there's no choice but for the SWAT Kats to destroy them.
</li><li> The Blue Manx fighter jet in "The Ghost Pilot." Played straight. Apparently, the Enforcers had just the one, left a grand total of two guys to guard it (!), and once the Red Lynx steals it, they have no means of countering it. Meaning they didn't learn from Puma-Dyne's earlier screw-up with the Behemoth and Macro-Bots.
</li><li> The anti-weapon scrambler in "SWAT Kats Unplugged." Played straight. You'd think Puma-Dyne would've learned from the Behemoth/Macro-Bot debacle to have backups and countermeasures ready, but nope. Once Hard Drive gets his hands on it, there's nothing to counteract the device's effects. Its inventor, Dr. Ohm, <em>is</em> shown frantically trying to build a second device to counteract the first one, but the SWAT Kats find a means of defeating Hard Drive without resorting to weapons before he finishes it.
</li><li> Viper Mutagen 368 in "The Origin of Dr. Viper." Averted, then subverted. Although there exists only one sample of the mutagen, Dr. Zyme does have notes on how to make more. This allows for more to be made in the event that something happens to the sample - which it does when Zyme's thieving assistant Purvis steals it and spills it on himself. However, <em>then</em> it turns out Zyme's calculations were flawed, and the formula has the unintended side-effect of mutating Purvis into Dr. Viper, so the existence of his notes become a moot point - after all, the formula is "worthless." That is, until Viper uses them to start making <em>more</em> of the stuff in an effort to turn Zyme, Callie and Mayor Manx into mutants, too, giving another example of how sometimes, having the notes/plans can be a <em>bad</em> thing.
</li><li> The micro-brain repair unit in "Unlikely Alloys." Averted, then subverted, then played straight. It turns out Greenbox had a device to shut the thing down in the event it went rogue (that or he quickly whips one up), but he never gets a chance to use it because after the repair unit becomes sentient, names itself "Zed," and starts going around on the usual rampage, Greenbox gets too big for his britches over what "his genius" has created, and not only refuses to use the shutoff device, but smashes it. And of course it was the only one.

<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> was composing the Ring Cycle, he at one point intended for the operas to be performed three times in a purpose-built opera house. Afterward, all copies of the score and all the props were to be burned, along with the <em>entire opera house</em>. Obviously this did not happen. But it explains the elaborate finale...
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a> died of heart failure in 1943 most of his plans went with him. His memory was phenomenal, and he had to constantly deal with limited resources. This meant that he did most of his work either in his head or directly tinkering with a single functional prototype until reaching the final design, which he then dismantled and cannibalized for his next project. He also invoked this intentionally in some of his work, as he was extremely paranoid, especially towards the end of his life. He said that his office had been ransacked during this time by persons unknown looking for notes or blueprints, but that they couldn't have gotten any because his plans had never been written down. Of course, the fact that so many governments and individuals <em>were actually</em> interested in anything he came up with - given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCloudCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCloudCuckoolanderWasRight">so many of his absurd-sounding ideas, like radio, actually worked</a> - it's less crazy than it sounds. After his death, everything he <em>had</em> written down was seized by the US government, and has only recently been declassified. Probably a good decision. For instance, the few notes for his infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a>, the teleforce gun, while rough and somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">impractical</a> in concept, bears a striking resemblance to modern particle accelerators and plasma cutters. Other notes anticipated things like secure wireless computer networks, weaponized EMP, radar, and signal jamming.

A <strong>whole petrochemical factory</strong> of which nobody knew how it worked, why it was built that way, which processes it ran or how it was constructed.
</li><li> Deliberately invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>. He had the sets, models, and production notes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> destroyed once filming was finished, so they would not be reused for some low-budget B-Movie. When someone else decided to make <em>2010</em>, they had to painstakingly go frame-by-frame to reconstruct the sets.
</li><li> The way <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">The Turk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> looks is only shown by artists' drawings; there are no actual blueprints. The artist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClockworkGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClockworkGame">Clockwork Game</a></em> had to make an educated guess as to its functioning.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>. In 1637, he stated tantalizingly in his commentary for a book that he had figured out a proof for a theorem, but there was not enough space in the margin for him to explain. He never did, and left no notes about it. It took 358 years of stumped mathematicians until it was finally figured out, in 1995. (It was solved using mathematics which hadn't been developed yet during Fermat's time and goes on for hundreds of pages, leading some to speculate that Fermat may have just decided to leave something to annoy future generations, or that he realized his proof wasn't correct, as there is a nearly-correct proof that is short.)
</li><li> This can happen in the computer world where the developers of a piece of software left the company and the sources are lost: you end up with a software that runs perfectly but which may not be improved nor reinstalled without some serious reverse engineering. And sometimes, even the sources may not be enough, as anyone who had to face a thoroughly uncommented code can attest...
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2014/10/the-lost-miracle-material-that-could-have-changed-the-world/">Starlite<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: An amazingly heatproof polymer, created by a lone inventor. Who died without ever revealing the recipe.
</li><li> When the Avro Arrow jet fighter project was abruptly de-funded and cancelled in 1959, orders were given by the Canadian federal government of the day to scrap the prototypes and blueprints, for fear of them falling into enemy hands. However, they did not destroy the rocket-mounted test models, which were fired over - and landed in - Lake Ontario. Some have been located on the lake floor; the team responsible for the find intends to recover them. Some models and documents have also survived.
</li><li> Many government agencies in the U.S. run on antiquated, out-of-production mainframe and minicomputer systems without any plan for replacement. To make things worse, many of the original programmers have long since retired or died. Not many computer science programs in the country are going to devote much time to PDP-10 assembler, either.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a>'s tenure on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, it was intended for the character of Kamelion to become a companion, which would make him a regular member of the cast. However, Kamelion was portrayed by an animatronic prop, and some time after his debut the only person on the planet (and we mean the real planet Earth) who knew how to operate the blasted thing died in a boating accident without telling anyone else how to work it. As a result, Kamelion only made one other appearance in the series, that being "Planet of Fire", where he was killed off.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Segato">Girolamo Segato<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a scientist who figured out how to petrify human body parts in a way that has never been seen before or since. He seems to have injected the recently-deceased with an unknown chemical that somehow reached even the tiniest of blood vessels (which generally collapse soon after blood stops pumping through them). Segato destroyed all of his notes in the fear someone would steal his ideas, and thus the technology died with him. The petrified bodies are <a class="urllink" href="http://s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/8/2/328382_v1.jpg">very<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/8/4/328384_v1.jpg">disturbing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (the linked pictures are NSFW).
</li><li> Machine learning software has shades of this. Of course it can and does get tested and copied countless of times, but many of its applications are essentially "black boxes", whose own creators can't fully explain how they work. Subsequently, they can be very difficult to update if a major bug is discovered in them.
</li><li> In business, especially in software development, this idea is sometimes known as the "Bus Factor". How many people would have to be hit by a bus for some important knowledge or ability to be lost? If that number is 1, your business is in trouble.
</li><li> Stradivarius violins. Despite many theories and analyses, no one has ever really determined the reason for, or has been able to replicate, their superior quality sound. To be fair, though, double-blind tests with other violins have not always found Stradivarius to be the best.
</li><li> A material code-named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOGBANK">FOGBANK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the U.S. military plays a crucial role (the exact nature of which is classified) in the functioning of thermonuclear weapons. Mass production of it ceased in 1989, and was picked up again in 2000. These plans quickly ran into problems. Records of the manufacturing process were sparse, and attempts to produce the material in a new facility failed. Successful manufacturing only resumed eight years later and after 92 million dollars was spent trying to recreate the process. It turned out a crucial element for the functioning of the material came from an impurity that was accidentally introduced in the original manufacturing facility.
</li><li> In the mid-2000s, NASA contracted various manufacturers for a new rocket engine for upcoming space programs which would go back to the old single-use systems rather than the somewhat reusable Space Shuttle. Some people wondered why NASA didn't dig up and use the plans for previous rocket engine designs such as the F-1 or the J-2. People speculated that either NASA lost the original plans or that the original plans were backed up in a data format that's unreadable by modern computers. It turned out neither were true. NASA did have the original plans and they could use them, the problem was that they weren't usable as-is. Today, with sophisticated computer modeling programs, we design and solve everything as much as possible before even building the first prototype. But back then? They had to build something that appeared good enough, test it, and tweak the engine before testing again until they got to the "good enough" state. The problem was those <em>tweaks</em> were what was lost in time, either because they were kept on the engineer's notebooks or they kept a mental recollection of it. However, it was better to design the engines using current techniques anyway because they turned out to be, at least on paper, more efficient and simple.
</li><li> The Heinkel He 100 was a prototype fighter that never went into production, but nevertheless was regarded as the fastest design of the time, to the point that it broke a world speed record. Why the Germans never put it into production is unknown, but all of the prototypes were destroyed and even the blueprints were lost in a bombing raid.
