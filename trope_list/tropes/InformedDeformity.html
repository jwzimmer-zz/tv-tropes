<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> characters often say that Hayate looks "poor" or "seedy" but to the viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">he looks pretty similar to the other characters</a>—in fact he IS thought of as attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">when dressed as a girl</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lina Inverse is always teased for being flat. While she may have a smaller bust size than some of the other female characters, it would be a stretch to call her flat-chested by any normal standard.
</li><li> There's also the chimera Zelgadis - as a result of a spell mixing his genes with a demon and a golem, his skin is blue and his body is covered with scale-like rocks. Sure, he'd probably be incredibly uncanny-looking to the cast and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, but compared to some monsters and the chimeras that appear in the novel series, he's outright handsome. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">art style</a> for the later novels and the anime certainly doesn't help matters.
</li></ul></li><li> In an early story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain">Count Cain</a></em>, Viola wears a mask to hide her horrible deformity, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which turns out to be a small acid burn marring an otherwise normal face. Justified in that she's completely insane.</span>
</li><li> Yura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHunt">Honey Hunt</a></em> is mentioned by people around her, namely her teachers and peers, to be very plain. However, when she loses the glasses, fixes her hair and wears more flattering clothes she's actually quite attractive.
</li><li> Two examples from Whole Cake Island Arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlotte Pudding was considered a freak due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye">Third Eye</a> and was told to cover it even by her own mother Charlotte Linlin, a.k.a. Big Mom. Her shame over her "deformity" was so great that she considered herself a monster, becoming a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> psychologically. However, Pudding's world got flipped upside down when Sanji pointed out how beautiful her third eye actually was. Hearing someone compliment her shameful extra eye for first time was too much for Pudding to take and she developed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> to cope. She actually fell in love with Sanji because of what he said however she left him because she didn't consider a "monster" like herself worthy of him... poor Pudding</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlotte Katakuri is ashamed of his eel-like mouth full of sharp teeth. Like his younger sister Pudding, he was mocked for this as a child. Katakuri initially didn't care (as he was strong enough to beat up anyone who tried bullying him), but when Brulee (another of his sisters) was attacked as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a> against him, he began to hide his mouth behind a scarf. While even people on this wiki label him with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace">Butter Face</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">Nightmare Face</a> tropes, Katakuri's face is relatively normal by One Piece standards and his shame over it makes him a worse person than he is</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Imperial Poisonous Concubine</em> we are informed, even in the summary about how incredibly ugly the main character is. Never at any point is there the slightest sign of this, aside from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">tiny facial scar</a>, which gets removed after a few chapters. Yet until that point she is treated like a pariah by people much uglier than her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, Terrible Tornado is a 28-year-old woman that apparently looks like a child. It's a personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for her and she is sometimes teased by Saitama <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g47q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0g47q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g47q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who is probably the only character who can get away with it without being beaten within an inch of their life</span> for it. While Tornado <em>is</em> short, she also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">distinctly</a> womanly curves that should put that notion to rest. This is also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a> in relation to the original webcomic, where Tornado really <em>could</em> be mistaken for as child.
</li><li> This trope and a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a> happens with Therru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TalesFromEarthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TalesFromEarthsea">Tales from Earthsea</a></em>. In the book, Therru is hideously disfigured due to burns (in fact, on one hand her fingers have melted together, leaving her with something described as "a lobster claw"). Although the film still mentions how strange looking she is, her burns have been reduced to a faint pink splodge on her cheek that you have to <em>squint</em> to see properly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Sakura is often said to have a very big forehead. However, when you compare it to the other characters, it looks to be completely normal. This is mostly a case of changing art styles. Originally, she did have a big forehead. Her character design just changed, and the jokes didn't stop.
</li><li> Sweden in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> is said to be utterly terrifying. Prussia faints multiple times just looking at him, but he really doesn't look much different than most of the other characters.
</li><li> L in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that he's meant to be the "Anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a>": scruffy and unkempt with messy hair, bags under his eyes, and the impression of having a permanent hangover. In reality L is as good-looking as many other male anime leads, with only the dark marks under his eyes alluding to any kind of "imperfection".
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/GoddessCreationSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/GoddessCreationSystem">Goddess Creation System</a></em>, Xiaxi is treated like some hideous troll, but the worst you can say is that she doesn't put much effort into her clothes, has unflattering glasses, is <em>slightly</em> chubby and *gasp* has freckles.
</li><li> Ataru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> is often rejected by girls at his high school and has the reputation of being the most ugly boy in the whole school. This is despite the fact that he looks like an average teenager, is actually better looking than some of the other boys who don't get as much flak by the girls. He had a cute girlfriend at the start of the series, and gets the attention of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a>, Lum, much to everyone's surprise, and gets the attention of other attractive girls throughout the series. Given that everything surrounding his birth was around bad luck, like being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">born on Friday the 13th</a> is one way the series explains his ordeal throughout the show, which goes far beyond people thinking he's ugly.
</li><li> Naruse from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomiCantCommunicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KomiCantCommunicate">Komi Can't Communicate</a></em> is generally told by others that he's an average-looking person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">who thinks way too highly of himself</a>. While the second part is true, he's drawn as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">genuinely handsome and fit</a> in a manga that averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a> for male characters.
</li><li> Much is made in the first few arcs of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a>" of Phoenix Ikki's old forehead scar, but it never is actually visible, even when it's reopened and bleeding.
</li><li> Many older elf women in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InterspeciesReviewers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InterspeciesReviewers">Interspecies Reviewers</a></em> are treated as though they are old hags, even though they look beautiful and young to the viewer and Stunk. Justified, in that those who are aghast at their age are men like Zel and Crim, who can sense Mana and can feel how old the women are, so the deformity hinges on a sense that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Stunk</a> and the viewers do not have.
</li><li> Maika Sakuranomiya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em> is often treated as though she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a>, even though her design is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">just as cute as everyone else's</a> despite her occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnSmile">frightening smiles</a>. There's an attempt to justify this with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes">Tsurime Eyes</a>, but it doesn't make much of a difference.

<ul><li> If youre a character in the French-Canadian comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesNombrils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesNombrils">The Bellybuttons</a></em>, and your name isnt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Jenny or Vicky</a>, then you <em>have</em> been called ugly at some point. The main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">Karine</a> is particularly often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">a victim of this</a>.
</li><li> Teddy "Red" Herring, the title character of <em>Red Herring</em>, is referred to by several characters as having an obviously false right eye; it's a running gag that whenever someone asks about it, he gives a different explanation. However, the artwork shows both of his eyes to be identical, and the false eye clearly moves in tandem with the real one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Seconds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Seconds">Seconds</a></em>, the narration describes Lis as very gangly, but the art style and the fact that she's squatting on her haunches most of the time will cause the reader to question how she is different from any other character in this regard. In her few appearances standing at full height, she appears a bit shorter and less "gangly" than Hazel, whose appearance is described as attractive.

<ul><li> It is revealed by Ant-Man of all people that Doctor Doom has restored his face many times, whenever he gains some form of cosmic power, such as from the Silver Surfer, the Beyonder, or the Infinity Gauntlet. And every time he manages to blow it and get brought down to normal again, he inflicts new scars on himself so he still has something to blame for all his problems.

She's often called hideous, and is called a "night troll", though the actress is rather pretty in reality. Ginny gets the same treatment, and is often called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Butterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Butterface">Butterface</a>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in both cases, however.

It's noticeable enough to get a bunch of nosy grandmothers to urge him to get a nose job (he declines), but aside from that, it doesn't prevent several people from remarking on his attractiveness, developing crushes on him, or wanting to have sex with him.

Never mind the fact that <em>anyone</em> can see that he's taller than all of them, although it's mostly thanks to his huge head.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Uglydolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Uglydolls">Uglydolls</a></em>, Lou is such a stickler for perfection that even the tiniest flaw (from a single freckle that has to be seen through a <em>magnifying glass</em> to critiquing a character with the same exact body type as everyone else, yet is claimed to have multiple issues aside from a slightly lopsided appearance), that he deems every bad flaw as "ugly".

When the mask eventually comes off, however, his face is revealed to be little more than a bit lumpy. Compare this to the musical, where Erik's face is much more disfigured to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror">Facial Horror</a>.
</li><li> Kyle in the movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beastly">Beastly</a></em> isn't quite deformed enough to justify his forced isolation.

He's clearly the only one who thinks he's ugly - a girl who sees him at a party in his transformed state appreciatively comments on his appearance. This is a deliberate subversion, as he was cursed to be what he <em>thinks</em> of as ugly due to mocking the local goth witch for her extreme alternative fashion choices.
</li><li> Played for laughs in-universe in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyGame">Spy Game</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a> constantly mocks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRedford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRedford">Robert Redford</a> for being hideously ugly, but he's obviously just kidding.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a></em>: The narration informs us that Jesse James suffers from granulated eyelids, which make him blink more often than normal. This is accompanied by a lengthy shot of Jesse gazing unblinkingly into the horizon. Over the course of the film, he seems to blink less often than normal.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork">Gangs of New York</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>'s character is captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who claims he will disfigure him with a heated knife, even going so far as to describe which parts he will cut from his face. When we next see the character, he is shown from behind as he walks down the street with people stopping to gawk at him. When the camera pans around, the audience is treated to the image of... the still very handsome Leonardo Di Caprio with a face that is fully intact. The only difference is a slight scar on his cheek that is hard to notice in some scenes.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">Special Effects Failure</a>, with her fake warts and twisted teeth, the mutant woman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorFromTheYear5000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorFromTheYear5000">Terror from the Year 5000</a></em> comes across as merely unattractive, even ugly, but still clearly human, and not the hideous, monstrous mutation the movie makes her out to be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em>, Prince Zuko is implied to be gruesomely scarred like his cartoon equivalent. Instead all we get are some barely discernible discolorations, that at worst, might be lumps. Chalked up to terrible makeup artistry in this case.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Penelope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Penelope">Penelope</a></em>, it is said that she had the face of a pig, and every every eligible bachelor she meets throws himself out of a window to avoid marrying her. She doesn't have a pig's face, and while she does have a pig's nose, she is not ugly, let alone throw-yourself-out-of-a-window hideous.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gidget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gidget">Gidget</a></em> film is a slight example. The nickname "Gidget" stands for "girl midget", and the title song is all about how the singer is attracted to Gidget despite how short she is—but (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort">Teens Are Short</a> is in effect) Gidget is not significantly shorter than her friends of the same age. At one point her mother makes a gesture which suggests that Gidget (then absent) is about half a foot shorter than she actually is once she appears.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowIsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowIsForever">Tomorrow Is Forever</a></em>: John is a soldier who's been wounded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. When we see John in the hospital, his face is swathed in bandages, except for a hole for one eye. John and the doctor talk at length about how John doesn't have a face. John decides to not reveal his identity because he doesn't want his wife Elizabeth to have to take him back out of pity. When we see him after the 20-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> he looks just the same, except he has a beard and some more wrinkles, and he has a limp. That's it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em>, when Tom first sees Hester Shaw's face completely uncovered he reacts with a look of pure horror, and later when being sold as slave her appearance is mocked by Wreyland. This is in spite of the fact that Hester's "disfigurement" consists of a couple of lines across her cheek that are barely noticeable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne2018">Ready Player One (2018)</a></em>, Artemis is insecure about her real-world appearance because of her facial birthmark but when we finally see her real face, her birthmark is light, covers only a small portion of her face, and is barely visible in the right lighting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JojoRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JojoRabbit">Jojo Rabbit</a></em>, Jojo's facial scars caused by a grenade accident are called hideous by many other people including Jojo himself, but the scars aren't <em>that</em> bad and become faded enough that they're not really noticeable in bright lighting. This was likely an intentional filming choice, as the film takes place in Nazi Germany and the Nazis were so obsessed with Aryan appearance ideals that they <em>would</em> consider a minor facial disfigurement like Jojo's to be a hideous blight.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBirthmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBirthmark">The Birthmark</a></em>: Georgiana's birthmark is not all that bad even from the perspective of many in-universe. It's implied that the women who have argued it makes her face horrible only say that out of jealousy, and the author explicitly states that Aylmer only became obsessed with it because it was the only small imperfection in his wife.
</li><li> Intentionally invoked in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">cosmic horror stores</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> often feature mind-bendingly horrifying creatures that are usually described in a very abstract fashion or left completely off-screen and only shown through a character reaction shot. The fact that said reaction usually involves the viewer immediately descending into gibbering madness makes the narrator's refusal to fully describe them to the reader a setting plot point. (He's either shielding the reader from the madness intentionally or is so mad himself that he can't really describe things coherently anymore.)
</li><li> In the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em>, the whole point of people's reactions to Hyde is not of any deformity unto itself but the pure <em>evil</em> radiating from the man. Even a surgeon gets rattled by his appearance. He's actually rather unremarkable, other than being a bit on the small side — he's described as having the air of some unseen deformity rather than actually being deformed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProvenGuilty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProvenGuilty">Proven Guilty</a></em>, Harry's narration informs us that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fix,the current Summer Knight</span>, is not good-looking. He then describes- for two paragraphs- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fix</span>'s scent of "pine and honeysuckle", and how he exudes "confidence and strength". It's easy to forget that the man is supposedly ugly. Harry also knew him before his ascent into Fey cosmic beauty, and tends to be something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> when it comes to anything associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a>. This is probably an invoked use of the trope, an intentional inversion of the florid descriptions of women the character finds attractive in the earlier books to let us know that he still possesses the flaw despite his attempts at reform.
</li><li> The short story <em>The Scarf</em> is about a woman who was in a bad car accident, and never goes out without a scarf covering her horribly disfigured face. The paperboy gets curious about this, and eventually breaks into her house and pulls the scarf off. Shocked at what he sees, he trips and hits his head, knocking himself out. The woman then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookAtMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookAtMe">kills him by smashing his head against the floor.</a> She then prepares to call the police with a story about how he assaulted her, but not before replacing the scarf...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> over her face which is totally unmarked except for one tiny faded scar on her forehead.</span>

Kevin probably plays it the hardest; he considers it a more significant deformity than having two heads. In the Netflix adaptation, he's even given a good-looking actor, making his angst all the sillier.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin">Martin</a></em>, Martin Pain is often teased by Pam to be "too short" for a man, although Martin isn't all that short, and while he isn't much taller than the female characters, he certainly isn't as tiny as Pam loves to make him out to be, especially compared to Cole, who is the shortest male character in Martin's group of friends (yet Cole is commented more on his stupidity rather than his height) with Tommy being the tallest and looming over everybody. A more common insult that seems to be very well-known by all the other characters on the show is that Marty-Mart is always stated to have such very big ears that stick out a lot, and while they do noticeably stick out, his ears don't stick out so much as people exaggerate them to be. Funnily enough, whenever Martin and his girlfriend Gina are about to kiss, he always tells her to grab his ears before they do so, or if Gina is talking to him on the bed she might playfully tug at one his ears.
<ul><li> On the same show, Gina is often insulted by her friends and even her boss for having a big head, although her head is really no bigger than anybody else's and looks to have a normal-sized head. It doesn't help there was an episode where she had somehow gotten her head stuck in between the bars of the metal headboard of her bed and unable to pull it out so she went around wearing it in shame, which apparently made her the Big Head girl and laughing stock. In real life, her head would be small enough for her to easily slip out of the heavy Headboard if anything.

Elizabeth Moss, and the character of Peggy for that matter, are at worst in the high range of average in appearance.

However, she doesn't use any kind of walking aid, has no visible limp, and seems to get up and down the stairs of 221B Baker Street with relative ease. In this case, it is sometimes implied that this is just her excuse recreational... errr <em>medicinal</em> use of marijuana.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, Doctor Sanders is described as horrifically disfigured, even though her scars are barely visible (most of the time—their visibility tends to fluctuate episode by episode). This seems weird and unjustified in Season One, since she's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyAcker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyAcker">Amy Acker</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In Season Two, we find out that she's a doll, and it makes more sense - a doll with facial scars, even if they don't actually make her ugly, would be pretty useless <em>as a doll</em>.</span>

Throughout the episode, a doctor attempts to fix a woman's horrible disfigurement, which is distressing to her and the other people working in the hospital, before he declares it impossible and sending her to live in a colony of people like her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The doctor, and everyone else on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted">assumed-to-be-Earth planet</a>, looks quite alien, with features including a pig nose and hooked upper lips.

This is possibly justified psychologically - he hides his face and acts as if he's ashamed of his appearance, and other people pick up on it and react badly. In the final season, in which he's more confident and less overpowered by self-hatred, he casually interacts with ordinary people without provoking exaggerated reactions.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>'s "UnDashing" gimmick was based on him believing himself horrifically deformed after having his nose broken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio</a>. He wore a protective mask and often came to the ring with a hood or towel over his head amidst dimmed lighting. In reality Rhodes looked exactly like he did before the accident, suggesting his narcissistic character had been so traumatized by the mere idea of losing his good looks, he had developed Body Dismorphic Disorder. The announcers were not sure how to treat it. Sometimes they acted like he was legitimately ugly, but other times they treated the deformity as being mostly in his head.
</li><li> When his mask was ripped off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hunico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hunico">Hunico</a> was subjected to this treatment by an overly-dramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>.

Kane had spent his entire career up until 2003 wearing a mask and bodysuit to cover up severe burn scars he had received in a fire that killed his parents. He lost a match to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> and as per a stipulation, had to remove his mask. The man underneath the mask had a bad haircut and the eye makeup had smeared all over his face, but he otherwise looked fine and had no burn scars. This was incorporated into the storyline with Kane wearing a towel over his head to cover his supposedly burnt face, with characters pointing out that he wasn't scarred or deformed in any way. Kane was so traumatized by the fire that he couldn't accept reality, believing that everyone was lying to him and mocking him behind his back, which led to him attacking just about everyone he came across in very brutal ways.

One Bloom actor got around it by amending his rant to "once-fat".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, it seems that Mercutio actually has a bad self-image. When putting on a mask prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasqueradeBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasqueradeBall">Masquerade Ball</a>, his dialogue suggests he thinks he's so ugly he needs it:
<div class="indent"><em>"Give me a case to put my visage in: <br/>A visor for a visor! what care I <br/>What curious eye doth quote deformities? <br/>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me."</em>
</div></li><li> Happens frequently in productions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em>; although everyone in the play (including Richard himself) goes on a great deal about his deformity, it's often downplayed in terms of costuming and physical acting. This is partly because the play <em>also</em> emphasizes Richard's talent for (medieval) warfare, and partly because it's a long play and the part is notorious for crippling actors.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryV">Henry V</a></em> King Henry makes a speech to Katherine apologizing for his appearance, explaining that his father was thinking of civil wars when he was conceived, and so he was born with a face to frighten enemies. Yet of course Henry is typically very handsome-looking on stage (in the 2012 BBC version, he's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a>, yowza).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Violet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Violet">Violet</a></em>, the horrible disfigurement of the title character is a major plot point, but that disfigurement is not seen by the audience. She was played on Broadway by the absurdly gorgeous Sutton Foster, and only the words and actions of the characters indicate the severity of her scars.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>, any character seeing Elphaba for the first time tends to recoil in shock at her uglyness, simply because she's green. Even her lover only calls her beautiful because he's "looking at things another way". In actual fact, Elphaba is a young and beautiful woman (with none of the uglyness of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">Wicked Witch of the West from the movie</a>, no crooked nose or warts) who only looks unattractive at the beginning of the musical because she wears her hair in a boring braid, glasses, and conservative clothes (but this is clearly not what people find ugly about her).

As the entire franchise consists of mostly-robotic cyborgs, differing beauty standards might enter into it, but as far as any observer can tell, their only "monstrous" traits are a mildly slouched stance, asymmetrical arms, a Rhotuka spinner in the back, and a head construction method that doesn't use traditional mask methods. Most of these traits (and most of their parts, for that matter) have been seen in other characters, and even other Toa, without any remarks. Other than that, they're still completely humanoid, and use an almost identical bodyplan to the later Inika builds.

She also adds that Rin has a nice and young feminine body, unlike her — but Rin is actually physically older and taller, and if anything, has a more muscular build than Saber.

<ul><li> This happens with Meg numerous times, as the other characters often treat her as horrifically ugly despite her being relatively normal looking. Some characters have even gone so far as to douse themselves with gasoline and light themselves on fire whenever she approaches. She's also mistaken for a boy several times, despite having a clearly female chest.

It's probably because Homer would be attractive (for the show) if he took better care of himself. An early episode had Homer grow his hair and dress nicely, and Patty and Selma were stunned at his looks. Herb Powell is Homer with hair and no pot belly, and he's also pretty attractive in-universe.
</li><li> Homer's weight is a frequent subject of mockery by other characters, including people like Chief Wiggum, who is visibly fatter than Homer. For that matter, Barney is nearly twice Homer's size and yet few people comment on this. The latter might be due to Barney's much more obvious flaw, his constant drunkenness.
</li><li> On more than one occasion Lisa Simpson is described as having a big butt, despite her actual character design being more or less the same as the other Springfield kids.
</li><li> While Moe Szyslak is quite odd-looking compared to other characters, people act like he's hideous and even inhuman (one gag had him bleeding green when trying to prove he is not a monster).

When the gang encounters the Phantom, he rants about how hideously deformed he is and only begrudgingly lets them see him without his mask. Once he takes it off... he's completely normal. Nothing special, but not bad either. It turns out the only mirror he had was an old funhouse mirror that greatly distorted his appearance. When Daphne lends him her compact for a more accurate reflection, he declares himself an Adonis.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>, the gang meet a band of wastelanders who think beauty and ugliness are the opposite. They call their one normal-looking member Ugly Jimmy, and it later becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Informed Attractiveness</a> when they start calling him Handsome Jimmy after his face gets busted up from falling off a cliff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> has a very simplistic art style, with many of its characters identical except for clothes and hair, so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">attributes</a> wind up being informed.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">Wendy</a>, trying to make a point about how everybody has physical flaws:
<div class="indent">"I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">Stan</a>] have short legs. And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders. The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne! Lola's arms are too short! Nichole's eyes are puffy! Annie has thin hair! And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!"
</div></li><li> There was one character who was supposedly the "ugly child" in school, but actually looked like everyone else.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with Ugly Bob. Apparently he's absolutely hideous by Canadian standards, but to others (except Saddam Hussein) he just looks like every other Canadian. A later episode shows that he's moved to America to take advantage of this fact.
</li><li> Then there was the episode where Cartman went to jail, and the kids had to pick out a new "fat kid." They unanimously agreed that it was Clyde, even though he's not drawn any different than the others. (At one point Clyde even notes that he's only a little pudgier than the others, but they persist in mocking him.)
</li><li> In one episode the girls make a list that ranks the boys from cutest to ugliest, and Kyle happens to be at the bottom <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after it's manipulated by Bebe and her cohorts</span>. When he talks to his parents about it they say he looks fine, and also mention that he looks just like his father, but with his mother's (large and stereotypically Jewish) nose. Kyle seems horrified by this, even though a.) his dad doesn't look particularly ugly, and b.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseless">Kyle doesn't even have a visible nose</a>.
</li><li> In "The Ungroundable" someone refers to Pete (the half red-haired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Goth</a>) as having pockmarks, though there is no sign of them for the viewer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in "How to Eat With Your Butt." Butters is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">grounded</a> for supposedly making a funny face that ruined his school picture, even though he was only smiling. Butters is understandably confused, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">his parents accuse him of making the same stupid face</a> while he's talking to them, even though he isn't.
</li></ul></li><li> Blackarachnia does this (overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>) for the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Several Autobots find her attractive and the rest seem to pay her appearance no mind, but she constantly harps on her status of being techno-organic and hideous. Then in season three that mask she's been wearing comes off and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">oh dear lord. Not to mention that we get Sentinel trying to kill her for what she is.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Apparently, Kaeloo is overweight and Stumpy is ugly. To the viewers, Kaeloo looks just as slim as everybody else, and Stumpy looks normal.
</li><li> An interesting case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> is Helga Pataki. While she actually does look very odd (she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow">Big Ol' Unibrow</a>, a bulbous nose, billy goat-like ears, a large overbite and a scrawny build) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">so do most of the other characters</a> (the title character has a football shaped head for crying out loud!). Yet Helga is always the one who is called out for being ugly. She's even mistaken for a boy a few times, despite the fact that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">standard outfit</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyWithAGirlyStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyWithAGirlyStreak">pink dress</a>. There's even some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a> with Harold making fun of Helga's unibrow even though he has one too and is overall far less pleasant to look at than Helga is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>:
<ul><li> Early episodes sometimes had minor characters act as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">Daria</a> was hideously ugly, though in reality she's fairly average, save for her refusal to ever <em>try</em> to be pretty. In this case, it may have been more to showcase the shallowness of the other characters.
</li><li> In "Aunt Nauseam" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Stacy</a> mentions "a slight asymmetry in my shoulders that is very painful for me even to mention."
</li></ul></li><li> A season 2 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> had characters making a big deal over Lindsay's supposedly oversized feet; we don't see anything onscreen in that episode, but episodes before and after that one show them to be normal-sized (and actually a bit on the small side.)
</li><li> Not a <em>deformity</em>, but at least a distinctive trait: In "A Menace In Venice", one of the last episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></em>, the gang's friend Antonio is said to have green eyes, just like the paintings of his ancestors in a museum. But the style of animating faces from early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> is such that <strong>everyone's</strong> eyes are just half-circle lines and black dots. A few shots show Antonio's black dots with a pale center, suggesting light-colored eyes, but neither his nor the ancestral portraits show any actual <em>green</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Better yet, when the culprit is revealed to be a distant relative with the same distinctive eyes, he takes out one of the contact lenses he'd supposedly been using to hide their color and thus his identity. "Real color" exposed, his eye looks <em>exactly the same as when he was wearing the contact</em>.</span>

<ul><li> A delusional perception of one's own appearance as extremely flawed is known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder">body dysmorphic disorder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which often goes hand in hand with a plethora of other illnesses like eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialProfiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialProfiling">Facial Profiling</a> is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> nowadays when it appears at all, but in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, numerous racist publications used caricatures and pseudoscience to seriously argue that certain ethnic groups were inhumanly ugly while the supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Master Race</a> was divinely beautiful. In the Anglosphere, such publications tended to depict people of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant">White Anglo-Saxon Protestant</a> descent as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">The Beautiful Elite</a> and people of African and Irish descent as apelike in appearance. Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> published official propaganda contrasting goblin-like Jews with Teutonic supermen — even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> eventually proceeded to make Jews publicly identify themselves with yellow badges, which wouldn't have been necessary if Jews really did look so grotesquely different from other ethnicities.
</li><li> Certain social castes throughout history have been shunned as disgustingly unclean and "untouchable" despite not bearing any obvious differences from the rest of society (although such distinctions have thankfully lessened at least somewhat as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>):
<ul><li> Japan's traditional burakumin caste has no physical differences from other social strata. Their "deformity" was historically considered spiritual in nature, associated with their "impure" occupations like butchering animals and disposing of corpses. They're also metaphorically associated with physical degradation via a derogatory gesture of holding up four fingers, because it's easy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">lose a finger</a> through the sort of dangerous labour to which burakumin are often relegated, and because four fingers = four legs = animals. (This is also a big part of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands">Four-Fingered Hands</a> tend not to show up in Japanese media.) The lack of any actual identifying traits meant that in the pre-Shogunate era it was possible for them to assimilate into higher castes (some even becoming samurai) if a daimyō found their services valuable enough to conceal their heritage, but the Tokugawa Shogunate cut off this avenue of advancement by making all of the castes more rigidly hereditary. Unsurprisingly, many of the burakumin ended up joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">it didn't care about castes</a>. To this day, a large majority of Yakuza are thought to be of burakumin descent.
</li><li> A similar situation exists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a>, where Dalit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCaste">castes</a> have been historically relegated to "unclean" jobs like sanitation and butchery, and thus shunned by other communities. According to the ancient Chinese traveller <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faxian">Faxian<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it got so bad that Dalits in certain regions had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrocIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrocIsTicking">sound wooden clappers</a> when they left their segregated communities so members of higher castes could avoid contact with them.
</li><li> In parts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain">Spain</a>, a group called Cagots faced centuries of intense prejudice for...some reason. Going by the historical record, Cagots didn't have any ethnic differences from their neighbours, and the only identifying feature of a Cagot was that their parents were known Cagots. To make matters worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">All of the Other Reindeer</a> couldn't seem to pin down a consistent justification for hating these guys. Literal applications of this trope included claims that Cagots had leprosy, missing earlobes, one ear bigger than the other, or tails — though medical examinations disproved those by 1683. (As a side note, the myth about tails has also been applied to Jews.) Another claim was that Cagots were heretics. Indeed, they could very well have descended from a religious minority like Muslims, Cathars, Arian Goths, pagans, or even early Christians that were hated by their pagan neighbours and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">remained hated even after the others converted to Christianity themselves</a>. During the French Revolution, Cagots broke into government offices and burned all birth records, and public memory of Cagot lineages began to fade after that (though it took some time).
