The cooking part is mainly for looks.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Orihime is very fond of putting ingredients together in ways that stop the hearts of everyone listening to her recipes. As a result, very few people have ever had the courage to actually try her dishes. Those that do discover she's actually an excellent cook who makes the food, against the odds, taste wonderful, as confirmed both by Rangiku in the manga and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">databooks</a>. She eventually gets a part-time job in a bakery, settling down for bakery products like bread and pastries: the gang seems to like her bread well enough, and according to the novels she's good enough to be employed full-time. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a>, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">deviates from the manga</a> solely for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">comedy purposes</a> to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about Orihime's food being stomach-churning.
</li><li> Ayumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em> seems to be a decent cook, judging from Yuu's reaction to the noodles she makes in Episode 5... The problem is, most of the time she puts pizza sauce in <em>everything</em>, from rice to French toast.
</li><li> Cecile Croomy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is one of these, much to the dismay of anyone who tries to eat her food, especially her boss Lloyd and their subordinate Suzaku (who's too nice to say anything).
<ul><li> And Nina, too. That hot dog sauce... [shiver]
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em>, the Gorilla (who works at a Sushi bar) served his boss banana sushi. It had a deeper meaning, though.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> movie, Taichi and Hikari's mom Yuuko has come up with such original dishes as spinach cookies, potato juice and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">beef jerky shakes</a>. Somehow Izzy/Koushirou likes <em>all</em> of it. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">dub of the movie</a>, she states "It's the first time I've used flour to make a cake", when Izzy asks if he's put in enough. It gets burnt in the microwave, anyway.
<ul><li> Izzy still gets sick from the cooking, which is no mean feat, considering an early episode established him as liking things such as mustard and jelly beans on eggs.
</li><li> Worth noticing that this is all added by the English dub. The original movie <em>Bokura no War Game</em> had Koushiro needing to pee because Taichi's mother served him too much (perfectly normal) Oolong tea.
</li><li> There's also Mimi's mom, who makes kimchi fried rice with strawberries and cream. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreTasteInFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreTasteInFood">Mimi doesn't mind at all</a> and seems to take after her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri">Digimon Adventure tri.</a></em> when she tops Sora's savory cooking with whipped cream and jelly beans. In spite of this, the epilogue to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> shows that she became a celebrity chef.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>, the Legendary Warriors have to prepare hamburgers to help appease a local tyrant of a digimon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealed to be Petalmon</span> to save a family of digimon. Everyone tries to make a knockout burger to win over the digimon with varying degrees of success and failure. Takuya and Koji are the most extreme as they end up in a competition to come up with the better burger but keep making bizarre creations like burgers made from random seafood to one made from all <em>fruit</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, Dennis, the Chief Chef of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Russian Sushi</a>, sees to it that his restaurant delivers a rather...<em>unique</em> menu. While he's entirely capable of making normal, edible sushi, sometimes customers have to contend with strange concoctions.
<ul><li> Also Celty, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman">doesn't have a head</a> and thus, a sense of taste. Her roommate Shinra tried to eat it... but he started crying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>
<ul><li> Soma is an absolute whiz in the kitchen, capable of turning even the most basic ingredients into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">dishes so good</a> they're almost literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterThanSex">Better Than Sex</a>. The flip side is his infamous squid tentacles with peanut butter, which makes the people who eat them feel violated. His father is much the same way, producing dishes which have made him a <strong>GOD</strong> in the culinary world... and a snake-based dish Soma describes as "legendarily bad." There was also a mention of the infamous sardines in strawberry jam. In both these cases, there is some justification, as both have cooking styles which rely heavily on "brute force"-experimentation to create new flavor combinations (rather than extrapolating from known recipes or using knowledge of food chemistry), so it's pretty inevitable some of their experiments would end like this. However, both father and son take a certain level of sadistic glee in watching people's reactions to their cordon bleugh experiments.
</li><li> Soma's classmate Alice is a devotee of molecular gastronomy, a real-life culinary movement that (as mentioned elsewhere on this page) uses science to (in essence) subvert this trope. Many of her dishes involve ingredients you wouldn't necessarily think really worked together until you tasted them...and then it snaps into place. A lot of her recipes seem to be specifically inspired by Heston Blumenthal (who, besides the strange combinations and application of new techniques, loves messing with people's expectations, a trait exhibited by Alice), whose cooking is listed later on this page.
</li><li> Nao Sadatsuka, who is in the same year as them, has a different approach to this. She specializes in boiled dishes which smell and look <em>repulsive</em> at first glance, but they taste so good, once people get a taste they can't stop eating, comparing it to BDSM.
</li></ul></li><li> Kyo's uncle and adoptive father Kazuma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> does this. He is also incapable of making tea without messing something up.
</li><li> Kalinin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> cooked a borscht with ingredients such as cocoa powder and miso paste. <em>He</em> enjoys it since he's trying to recreate the cooking of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">late wife</a> out of nostalgia, but no one else does. There's also a subtle implication that his wife intentionally made the borscht bad to punish him for being married to the job and away so often. Kalinin doesn't notice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, Haruhi eventually explains that her mother is this. Apparently for most of her childhood, she didn't understand why food that other people made (including cheap store bought lunches) tasted so good, until she spied a cookbook and realized her mother just completely ignored the recipe and did whatever she wanted. Part of the reason she became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">Supreme Chef</a> was so that her mother wouldn't cook anymore.
</li><li> Yamada Ayumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover">Honey and Clover</a></em> specializes in things like apple and mint curry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em>'s Maelstrom's lunches look pretty good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">And then the condiments come out...</a>, an inversion would be Haruna's cooking, that even if it looks burned and inedible, in the case of egg cuisine, everything tastes delicious.
</li><li> Kitaoka Yume from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kanamemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kanamemo">Kanamemo</a></em> is an apprentice at a local patisserie and adds sugar to absolutely everything she cooks, even if it's not supposed to be sweet.

(They were stranded for thirteen days in Viridian Forest, with no stores nearby, and given how Ash's very first day as a trainer went (one disaster after another), it's highly unlikely he would have known how to cook, and the only person travelling with him prior to Brock joining is Misty, so... yeah. And she'd have to be decent enough of a cook to last through the 13 days stuck in Viridian Forest). It could well be that she panicked in the face of cooking solo at an unexpected time.

While she is generally impatient and unskilled, she also seems to consider written recipes "boring", or perhaps considers herself too good to need them, and so has a bad habit of discarding them to make things up as she goes along. The fact that she doesn't pay attention to what she's using only makes things worse: intending to use white wine in curry, then finding out she added vinegar instead is the first example in the series. A similar goof happens during the "Mrs. Tendo's Recipe Book" storyline, where she goes to pour white wine over stir-fried carrots, but uses vegetable oil instead.

For example, Endou's insistence on using Frisk, a very hot breath mint <em>par Fisherman's Friend Extra Strong</em> for his cooking, like Frisk Pizza or Frisk Tempura. Matsumoto settles on using <em>very</em> unusual ingredients, such as a whole tuna head for pizza, cake for flavored rice, and watermelon-and-milk-cream pasta.

Alton would tend to call out when the ice cream maker was about to be used, especially when he wasn't sure what was going into it, because the results could be hit or miss.

</li><li> <em>Cod soft roe</em> ice cream. Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai was chastised by the <em>entire</em> tasting panel for it. He later proved he didn't learn his lesson by making trout ice cream on one of the US edition pilots. Ever since, whenever fish and ice cream get mentioned in the same segment, Alton will tend to quip things along the line of, "If that's fish ice cream, I'm leaving!" One time, Iron Chef Morimoto managed to convey his memory of that ice cream in one word: "HORROR!" But then, in the new <em>Iron Chef Showdown</em>, newest Iron Chef Stephanie Izard, challenged with yellowfin tuna, <em>dared</em> to make a tuna ice cream.

Rimmer has been seen eating the sandwich, admittedly, and apparently it's actually quite good.

Blais himself would seem to fit the trope at first glance, but his food overall was often among the judges' favorites throughout the season.
<ul><li> Lampshaded earlier in the season by the judges' panel when Blais served them smoked salmon with a white chocolate-wasabi sauce. One judge's comment to him (paraphrased) was "When you described the dish, my immediate reaction was 'White chocolate and wasabi? What were you <em>thinking</em>'?" In the final judging, though, <em>every single judge</em> deemed that dish far and away the best of the night.
</li><li> Season 2 actually had a challenge to create a unique flavor of ice cream. Marcel decided to make a Bacon and Avocado ice cream. That dish was considered to be one of the worst dishes ever to be served on the show. From the same season, Sam mixed watermelon and bleu cheese with gnocchi, and Ilan made a chocolate ganache with chicken liver. Both these dishes... didn't go over so well with the judges either.

No matter what ingredients you chose, the friend will praise your concoction as long as everything is edible. If you put anything else, the stew is described at tasting "awful" or "strange".

Salted lemonade is actually fairly common in real life, since this both quenches thirst and restores salt loss from sweating (at Renaissance Fairs, they affectionately call it "dragon piss"), but soda with milk...
</li><li> A major part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> is combining items into edible foods. Sometimes the combinations are obvious, like putting sausage on a pizza, but some of the combinations are things that are only going to be found by trial and error, like combining batgut with spices to make bat haggis. And yes, in-universe, that is a good food (or at least a decent one).
<ul><li> The Avatar of Jarlsberg path allows you to make consummate foods using Jarlsberg's Cosmic Kitchen, which are pretty much described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">the platonic ideal of their respective foods</a>. Jarlsberg's cocktail-making abilities, on the other hand, are far more limited and pretty much an alcoholic version of this trope, leading to combinations like sauerkraut and lager or rum and nacho cheese.
</li><li> Three items in particular come to mind: white chocolate and tomato pizza, chorizo brownies, and tomato daiquiris (a Bloody Mary made with beer instead of vodka). The first two only come into being when a chef-in-the-box explodes; the latter, when a <em>bartender</em>-in-a-box explodes. Eating enough of the first and drinking enough of the last get you trophies.

They don't recover much health, and poor Link's eating animations for these items have him forcing himself to eat the Dubious Food and struggling to eat the Rock-Hard Food.

After Luigi captures Bogmire, the second boss, he offers to make dinner, saying he'll make his "old family recipe", pickled dandelions with barnacles in a diesel marinade. (Of course, we never see it or Luigi's reaction... <em>Maybe</em> it tastes better than it sounds...)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER">Mother</a></em> series, there's an item called Strawberry Tofu, which was meant as a joke on bad combinations of food. Well, someone literally made it and Itoi tried it and it does not work well. There's a video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> of someone suffering while trying to eat it.
<ul><li> Since Americans would be much less likely to show revulsion from it (particularly if familiar with tofu-based vegan ice cream), Nintendo translated the item as "trout ice cream" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> for fans of the game that later went on to watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em>.

</li><li> General rule of thumb of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series — the more feminine the woman, the less edible their food is.

<ul><li> When making a list of ingredients for curry, Yukiko and Chie include such things as radishes, kimchi, chocolate, and yogurt. Later, Rise uses foie gras in an omelette. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentProtagonist">main character</a> can also be this if the player selects the wrong options when making lunch. The main problem with Yukiko and Chie's ingredient choices is that they seem to have gotten the wrong end of the stick. Chocolate and yoghurt <em>are</em> both perfectly reasonable ingredients in a curry... but they should be plain yoghurt and dark cooking chocolate (90%+ cocoa). However they decided to use <em>fruit yoghurt and mint chocolate.</em>
</li><li> Rise, meanwhile, seems to be okay on ingredients, but makes her food <em>way</em> too spicy, at one point producing something that knocks poor Yukiko out in one mouthful.
</li><li> Even the protagonist has the option to be this if the player chooses the wrong options while cooking. You have the option to <em>spray cologne on creme caramel</em>, of all things.
</li><li> Naoto is the only girl who avoids being this. She does make the effort to read instructions, but it's implied she doesn't like to cook anyway.
</li><li> Nanako became one as the girl's proxy because of the girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Golden</a></em> as a result of numerous suggestions from Yukiko, Chie and Rise (Naoto tried to stop them but was unable to). Among other things, she was told to include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wheatgrass, fish sausage, bacon, iced coffee, bell peppers, vinegar, and fermented squid</span>.

</li><li> A sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em> has Red collecting ingredients for a big stew. You're told to pick whatever you think looks good, and at one point you have the option of putting a <em>poisonous barnacle</em> into the pot. If you do, it turns the whole thing purple (and then a bunch of other weird colours), but it smells delicious and turns out to be <em>fantastic</em>, so much so you get a bonus!
</li><li> El Fuerte is the fighting chef in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> who tried to combine chanko nabe and borscht together to create the ultimate dish. It's pretty good at turning faces blue.
<ul><li> He does it again by putting a whole carrot, a whole fish, fishbones, a rotten tomato, aojiru (kale juice, which is rich in nutrients but bitter to taste) and baker's chocolate in chili soup. (Although this last one isn't that unusual — chocolate, especially dark chocolate, goes very well when added to chili. Mexican chocolate is <em>meant</em> to be spicy and bitter.)
</li><li> It's implied in some sources (like the UDON comics) that the problem with El Fuerte is that his technical skill is at least average (he <em>is</em> seen working in a restaurant, after all), but he does fine only and IF only <em>he sticks to the recipe itself AND when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNoteCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNoteCook">he's making Mexican food</a></em>.

It's the only way he could get that good with the ingredients he's using, which are commonly fugu-levels of deadly if improperly done, and the proper way to make them tends to be terribly obscure and/or difficult. His kitchen looks like an alchemical laboratory precisely because he needs to try <em>everything</em> for every last new ingredient before he can find a proper way to do it. He will usually eat his mistakes himself (it's okay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">he's already dead</a>), thankfully, but even the good dishes can be eerie, if still tasty.

Before you get him something actually appropriate for making an ice cream flavor, his specialties include such incongruous items as salami salmon and vanilla onion. He himself laments those flavors tend to drive away the crowds looking for something to beat the heat.

The filling turns out to be a mixture of red-bean paste and strawberries which, while tasty in a daifuku mochi, is not so tasty when combined with the salted vinegar rice shell of a rice ball.
<ul><li> In another story event, Sasuke and the main character make a birthday rice cake for Kenshin that has chestnut icing and is decorated with egg slices, cucumber, and shrimp... which is actually <em>more</em> appealing than their initial plan of wasabi icing and sushi toppings.

Recipes from the Depression (where utilizing every scrap of food was important) and recipes from the advent of home refrigeration (when non-dessert gelatin was in vogue) tend to be ones that suggest the weirdest combinations. There are also "sponsored" cookbooks put out by food companies that suggest you use their product in <em>everything.</em> Some of the most notable include:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2011/07/tuna-pizza-tuna-contest-finalist-2/">Tuna "Pizza"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, made from biscuit dough, canned tuna, Parmesan cheese, evaporated milk and ketchup. They find it to be "gross", claiming that those ingredients should never be mixed together.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2012/06/chicken-mousse-aka-chicken-ice-cream-glistening-and-jiggly-finalist-4/">Chicken Mousse,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which is essentially roast chicken-flavored <em>ice cream</em> with the added bonus of being made with gelatin as well. They claim it's not a bad selection of seasonings for roast chicken, but <em>not</em> something to be served up whipped and chilled.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2012/02/liver-pate-en-masque-a-retro-gelatin-dare/">Live Pate en Masque,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which is essentially a liver and green bean <em>Jell-O mold</em> covered in <em>buttermilk.</em> It apparently smelled good, but they claim it tasted terrible.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2014/01/heinz-carnival-cream-aka-ketchup-ice-cream-a-mid-century-recipe-test/">Heinz Carnival Cream<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is <em>ketchup-flavored ice cream.</em> And it is, shockingly, not the only recipe Heinz has ever released <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2010/04/mid-century-menu-a-heinz-feast-with-toledo-ham-spicy-vegetable-casserole-and-pink-peach-sundae/">suggesting you combine ketchup and ice cream.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Their verdict was that it was actually delicious (but note that it probably helped that they could barely taste the ketchup).
</li><li> And for sheer volume of incomprehensible ingredient combinations, there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midcenturymenu.com/2011/09/the-yule-sandwich-loga-mid-century-recipe-test/">Yule Sandwich Log.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It's a combination of several sandwich fillings all in the <strong>same sandwich</strong>. The fillings include "pimento cheese-shrimp," "deviled ham-peanut butter," (which includes dill pickles) "egg-bacon" and "avocado-pineapple". The sandwich is then covered with a cranberry-flavored cream cheese frosting. Despite their initial shock after seeing the recipe and the way some of the mixtures ended up looking in the bowls during the preparation, their verdict was that the sandwich was good overall. They particularly liked the frosting and the egg salad filling, and they found the pimento-cheese shrimp filling to be alright. They found the ham-peanut butter filling to be "gross", but claimed that it was less so when having it in a bite with something else.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the above, the blog ''<a class="urllink" href="http://www.denbrunamaten.se">Den Bruna Maten (The Brown Food)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explores food from the late sixties — early seventies, when exotic ingredients like pineapple started appearing in Swedish supermarkets, but no-one really knew how to use them. The main things that can be taken away is that combinations of pork products and cheese are hard to mess up.

In the episode "Something Smells", he makes a sundae out of available ingredients when he was lacking normal ones: ketchup, onions, and peanuts growing on the window sill of his bathroom (as well as the dirt they came with). The resulting concoction gives him epic bad breath. Then there's "Patty Hype", where, while his idea for Pretty Patties wasn't bad taste wise, <em>somehow</em> manages to turn folks into various colors.

<ul><li> The cooks in the short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoodNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoodNetwork">Food Network</a> show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorstCooksInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorstCooksInAmerica">Worst Cooks in America</a></em> were this at the start. In the first round of one season, one of said cooks made spaghetti with a sauce made from tomatoes and... M&amp;M's.
</li><li> To its detractors, some of the more experimental manifestations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980s</a> fancy restaurant cooking fell into this. Lobster with vanilla sauce, anyone?
<ul><li> Notably, the food in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho">American Psycho</a></em> tends to sound like this.
</li><li> To properly understand what was fashionable in the 80s, one must read the <em>Silver Palate Cookbook</em> by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins. While nothing in it is particularly nasty or even unappetizing, the food in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho">American Psycho</a></em> and related media is essentially warped riffs on that. (Their <em>New Basics Cookbook</em>, written just before the two parted ways, is sort of an alternate universe <em>Joy of Cooking</em> based on everything odd and off-kilter about 80s cuisine.)
</li></ul></li><li> One of the hottest terms in cuisine has been <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy">molecular gastronomy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which uses science to figure out combinations of flavors that would taste good, no matter how weird they sound, often using some pretty cool gadgets to do it. Some of its more notable exponents are:
<ul><li> Heston Blumenthal—living proof that both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCuisine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCuisine">Englishmen and Jews</a> are perfectly capable of being great chefs—has a reputation for experimental cooking, although as with a number of other examples on this page the results are often less Cordon Bleugh and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">Impossibly Delicious Food</a>; besides molecular gastronomy's focus on the science of why things taste good (and thus why, for instance, bacon ice cream would actually work—he <em>also</em> made a well-received version), Blumenthal is also very interested in psychology and messing with people's expectations. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-481969/Chilli-barmy-Chef-Heston-Blumenthals-latest-wacky-experiment.html">Here's a good article about him.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Since about 2012, however, he's deemphasised the wacky experimentation and "molecular" recipes and focussed on producing traditional high-quality traditional British food, emphasising the things that make traditional British cookery good—no, you didn't read that wrong<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14kpc3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14kpc3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14kpc3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Blumenthal's basic philosophy when it comes to classic British cookery is that the British kitchen has always been good, it's just been <em>simple</em>: the English (or Welsh or Scottish or Irish) cook doesn't bother with fancy sauces and preparations, because everything tastes good when it tastes like itself, and the key to making good British dishes is finding small combinations of ingredients that taste even better when they taste like themselves <em>with</em> the other ingredients. The traditional bad reputation of British food, in Blumenthal's opinion, comes from the fact that when food is simple, one or two small mistakes can completely ruin the dish, while with complex, multi-layered dishes a minor error can be buried in the mix of flavors (Chinese and Thai cooking are good examples of this opposite extreme). He's also by his own admission rather a sucker for childhood nostalgia, which is why he loves indulging in classic British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortFood">Comfort Food</a>.</span>—with his modern, science-based modifications and twists—like his famous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Cooked_Chips">triple-cooked chips<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—to guarantee good results).
<ul><li> Try watching the <em>Feast</em> series, the historical ones are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine">Foreign Queasine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">Impossibly Delicious Food</a> in one package.
</li><li> When Heston Blumenthal guested on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan">Terry Wogan</a>'s Radio 2 breakfast show in late 2008, he made a dessert (pudding) that looked exactly like a pork pie but was made with ice cream and other traditonal dessert ingredients, a pot of "mustard" that was actually a sweet fruit puree (to drizzle alongside the faux "pork pie"), and "boiled eggs" that were made from white chocolate and other similar ingredents. Crowning Food Moment of Awesome, anyone? (Sir Terry raved on about the food and it caused not a fair amount of drooling from the audience.)
</li></ul></li><li> Ferran Adria—based in Barcelona—is another molecular gastronomist (gastronomer?), and also very good at making odd combinations of ingredients work as a dish: his restaurant, elBulli was consistently ranked as the best in the world for several years running (nevertheless, it closed in 2011, as it had somehow managed to operate at a loss since 2000). Adria thinks of his style as deconstructivist. The Kellogg's paella (Rice Krispies, shrimp heads, and vanilla flavoured mashed potatoes) is a good example of what he does.
</li><li> Grant Achatz—raised in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a>, but based in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>—is one of the Young Guns of this school of this cuisine despite having trained under the relatively traditional Thomas Keller. He particularly likes foams—one of Adria's innovations—and also playing around with the basic format of the restaurant (e.g.—his second restaurant, Next, doesn't take reservations but rather sells prepaid tickets for a set menu).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1503m2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1503m2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1503m2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He's also started two bars, both of which operate, essentially, as speakeasies—one being strictly invite-only—although as "speakeasies" are popular in Chicago now, it's hard to tell if he's the head of a wave or just riding it.</span> He also endured a case of tongue cancer that briefly messed up his sense of taste—although he was pretty odd before that, his creations since then have been, if possible, even weirder.
</li></ul></li><li> Michigan State University's on-campus Dairy Store has a tradition of maintaining a flavor for each member of the Big Ten Conference (including hated rivals Michigan). When the University of Nebraska joined, the store had to come up with a new flavor; because Nebraska is the <em>Corn</em>huskers, they decided to make the flavor with sweet corn and butter, including whole grains of corn. The reaction in East Lansing was puzzlement when the flavor was announced, and then general approval when it was released. (The flavors for Rutgers University and the University of Maryland, joining in 2014, took a while to announce, generating speculation they might follow the same path—both feature red as their main color and neither has a particularly <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights">appetizing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Terrapins">mascot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, at least not for ice cream.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16ddp8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16ddp8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16ddp8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, "terrapins"—North American freshwater and estuary turtles—are perfectly edible and actually good to eat (the diamondback terrapin that serves as the model for Maryland's mascot was actually considered a delicacy in the early 20th century) but as ice cream? They wouldn't even try that on <em>Iron Chef</em>.</span>) The flavors were eventually settled as a cherry/chocolate/brandy flavor for Rutgers (drawing on the scarlet), while Maryland got a chocolate/toffee flavor (because of the alliteration between "toffee" and "terrapin," but also hinting at "turtles"—chocolate-and-toffee-covered pecans, which the Dairy Store couldn't use because the term is trademarked).
</li><li> The pirate Blackbeard was famous for mixing gunpowder into his rum, either because it actually tasted good, or to make himself look more badass. Not that he's the only one, mixing gunpowder with alcoholic drinks (specially brandy or plain wine) once was pretty common among military grunts. It probably has something to do with the rather sour taste of gunpowder vs. the sweet wine. (Same reason port &amp; lemon was popular.)
</li><li> Frederick The Great took his coffee with mustard powder stirred in, and champagne instead of water. YMMV, but some people have attested that the acidic earthiness of mustard and coffee go very well together.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AceOfCakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AceOfCakes">Ace of Cakes</a> Duff Goldman was on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a> America,</em> the Battle he faced Michael Symon in had chocolate and chillis as the theme ingredients (meaning BOTH had to be used together in a dish; it could be either sweet or savory, but not all-chocolate or all-chili). Though mixing chocolate and chillis is an old tradition in Central America and Mexico going back to pre-Columbian times, which works because unlike store-bought milk chocolate, pure chocolate is extremely savory and works well with spice. Chilli-flavored chocolate remains fairly common in these parts and is recognized in the US as "Mexican" chocolate. Even the famed Tabasco brand came out with a chocolate bar spiced with their famous sauce because of the increasing Hispanic interest.
</li><li> Namja Town, an indoor theme park ran by Namco, has one ice cream store selling... <a class="urllink" href="http://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/cup-ice-museum-in-ikebukuro/2127">rather strange ice cream flavors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> How about curry, garlic, squid or horse ice cream?
</li><li> Fascist poet <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was fond of serving gastronomic delights such as salami soaked in coffee and eau de cologne.
</li><li> At <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Fur-Eh! 2018</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">this was done deliberately</a>. As part of a charity drive, one event had convention goers bid on the opportunity to add a topping to the entire pizza, whereupon Con Chair Thallanor Rasmussen would eat a slice, then the convention-goers would bid on what topping was added next. Each subsequent topping was added to the entirety of what was left, then Thallanor would eat a slice, rinse and repeat. The toppings were, in order: salsa, fuzzy peach candies, pear slices, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat">an ingredient concealed within a box</a> that turned out to be spinach puree, corned beef, and mayonnaise and tuna (the last two were added simultaneously to the last slice). The disgust was clear on Thallanor's face from the third slice onwards. There was a garbage pail beside him just in case he got sick. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">To his credit, he didn't</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">In 2019, Thallanor was subjected to this again,</a> this time with Poutine, a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada">Canadian</a> dish comprising french fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The first topping was Mayochup (a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise, the second Butterscotch syrup, and then the mess was mixed in with a convenience-store salad which included red onions, blue cheese, pears, strawberries, lettuce, and Caesar salad dressing. Then a tortilla, tomator sauce and Parmesan cheese were used to turn it into a "pizza". Poptarts, marshmallow fluff, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat">mystery ingredient</a> which turned out to be egg tofu were added all at once. The next round saw the addition of corned beef, sardines (which Thallanor claimed smelled like cat food), and a mystery sauce (even the creator, Dark Bunny Sauces, didn't know what exactly was in it) were added. The final round saw the addition of icing, mint jelly, and coconut gell. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Thallanor said it was even worse than the pizza!</a> He managed not to get sick, but had to discard much of it due to time constraints, much to his relief.
</li></ul></li><li> Children often do this with their food. Since their taste buds haven't developed yet, and have a lessened ability to distinguish flavors and a considerable preference for sweet foods, they'll happily enjoy a food combination that would likely disgust an adult. Similarly, older adults can seem this way to younger people due to generational differences in food preferences as well as people's sense of taste changing as they age.
</li><li> Even reasonably competent cooks can do this by accident if they make substitutions in recipes without understanding how the ingredients combine. People making substitutions in online recipes and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blaming the recipe</a> when leaving one-star reviews is a common joke among cooks.
</li><li> Averted in the book <em>The Flavour Thesaurus</em> by Niki Segnit. Some of the combinations seem downright revolting (aubergine and chocolate anyone?) but are either from real cuisine or have been pioneered by chefs around the world.
