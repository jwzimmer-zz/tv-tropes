<div class="indent"> I asked where the Teletubbies were to be found. The assistant said "in China, sir, where they make 'em." He said they'd had a few Laa-Laas on Monday, but they'd gone within minutes. I asked why we couldn't manufacture Teletubbies in this country.

<ul><li> It also makes the same point as <em>Eric</em>, below, about British fast food — namely that while the American version's sole redeeming qualities are its speed and the fact that the meal is hot and loaded with enough salt and sugar to make you not care, the British version <em>manages to screw even that part up</em>.

</li><li> In fact, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric">Eric</a></em> has a lengthy digression about the British habit of attempting to mimic an American product exactly, only without the one thing that made the American version worthwhile, such as slow fast food, and hotels that sacrifice atmosphere for efficiency, without the efficiency.

Here, a butcher can be hanged if his sausages are not all meat, and at that it must be from a named animal, and I perhaps should add that by named I do not mean that it should have been called "Spot" or "Ginger", mmm mmhm.

They'd ordered the component milled from solid 6061-T6 to withstand and contain the forces of Gigabyte's massively powerful spinning shell weapon, but the manufacturers had lied to them and provided with a piece made from cast alluminium, which is <em>immeasurably</em> weaker. Unsurprisingly, the piece snapped under the stress and caused Gigabyte's shell to fly off in the middle of a fight against Tombstone, the then <em>reigning champion,</em> and it was only thanks to the mercy of Tombstone's driver that the helpless Gigabyte wasn't annihilated on the spot. To add insult to injury, the company responsible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">flatly refused to even acknowledge</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">there was any fault in their product at all</a>.

<ul><li> Amazingly, pretty much the same thing happened <em>again</em> during the same series, this time in the <em>grand finale</em> bout, when Minotaur's side armor was ripped apart by Bite Force's weapon. The panel had been made from the same cheap kludge material as Gigabyte's securing bolt, and was about as durable, costing them the championship.
</li><li> Gigabyte's woes didn't end there. During the Desperado Tournament, its self righting rod snapped after it was upended by Lucky. As revealed by the team that operated Bloodsport the following year, that team obtained one of Gigabyte's remaining rods, which then proceeded to snap off in the very same fashion. Bloodsport's team would also reveal that the rod was <em>also</em> made from China, making it more likely that all of Gigabyte's self righting rods were likely made by the same manufacturer which made the defective securing bolt.

Unlike in the Gigabyte vs Tombstone battle, however, Earth Shovel was a flipper rather than another spinner, so Pot of Love bravely continued fighting with just the naked drive section, ramming hilariously against Earth Shovel in a futile but endearing show of defiance until the match went to time and Earth Shovel won on points.

For a long time, it was also seen as crap <em>in the US</em>, but the increasing prominence of craft brews in the American market is changing some minds.
<ul><li> A lot of craft brewers, when they're feeling particularly honest, admit they <em>wish</em> they had the reliability and quality control that, say, Anheuser-Busch does. Budweiser may not be a great beer, but it's a famously <em>consistent</em> beer.
</li><li> So is coffee for European tourists in the US.
</li><li> In fact, most of the US' food, particularly chocolate has this reputation. British people were horrified when Hershey effectively took over Cadburys, viewed as the apex of British milk chocolate. Damage has so far been limited, although there was widespread revulsion to one British chocolate icon, the Creme Egg, being "revised" to an American production standard.
</li><li> Hershey have production rights to the Cadbury name in the USA. British people going to America and seeing the familiar purple Cadburys wrapper are in for a nasty taste shock as the product inside is not they expected. Rather than upgrade the product to British production standards, Hersheys sought to make it illegal for the genuine British article to be imported to the USA.
</li><li> Russian beer is seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATankardOfMooseUrine">A Tankard of Moose Urine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe">in Russia itself</a>. Objectively speaking, though, it's just mediocre, roughly on the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> level as mass-produced American beer, and isn't actually that difficult to find on an import market.
</li></ul></li><li> Many tourists are surprised that domestic products that are seen as horrific in their own country are well-known in other areas, i.e. many Americans find it hilarious that Budweiser is advertised as "the" American beer, and Australians feel the same about Foster's.
<ul><li> And, quite ironically, Budweiser originates from Budweis (or České Budějovice), <em>in the Czech Republic</em>. And Czech beer is generally regarded as very decent (as long as it is fresh from the tap).
<ul><li> Of course, as Europeans will tell you, Czech Budweiser beer is a rather different product than its American namesake.
</li><li> As a matter of fact, the American Budweiser and the city of Budweis' <em>actual breweries</em> (Budvar in particular) claim a trademark on the name, and are therefore unavailable for sale in their respective counterpart's country (among many others worldwide) under that name.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Taking pride in their <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> which states that beer must be made only from hops, malt, yeast and water, many Germans have a tendency to look down with deep disgust on foreign-made beers that do not conform to the same purity standards.
</li><li> Any Dutchman will tell you that Gouda that isn't made in the Netherlands is crap and tastes like plastic.
</li><li> British food used to have this reputation, before London became gourmet mecca. Unless you're from France or Germany.
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope">Cyclic Trope</a>, caused by a variety of factors, but British desserts were generally highly regarded. The French named custard <em>Créme anglaise</em> for a reason.
</li></ul></li><li> Plenty of Belgians consider Dutch food and drink to be the epitome of awfulness. Often they say that Dutch food is low-budget food with a sauce over it to make it look good despite tasting horrible (the fact that Heinz was Dutch may have something to do with that) and Heineken gets lots of hate there. Considering that over time French food started getting imported in Belgium <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchCuisineIsHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchCuisineIsHaughty">with the obvious reaction following</a> and that Belgium has a very active beer industry it was predictable but still ironic, since The Netherlands has far more restaurants with 3 stars on the Michelin guide than Belgium. The fact that Dutch rarely talk about their cooking chefs while Belgians give them a lot of media attention may however have something to do with that.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Video Games</span>
</p><ul><li> Western <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> games are far more likely to be panned than Japanese shoot 'em ups, to the point that many shoot 'em up fans use the term "Euroshmup" as a term for badly designed shoot 'em ups.
</li><li> NES games that are made in Taïwan or America tend to get this treatment as well. They're either an unlicensed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> or they suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">The Problem with Licensed Games</a> or both.
<ul><li> This tends to be pretty relative though, as not every unlicensed NES game made in America and Taiwan is considered to be trash (though the majority of them are).
</li></ul></li><li> European video games of the 1980s and 1990s developed a reputation for lacking the polish of their American and Japanese counterparts, with issues like poor collision detection or unsteady frame rates being fairly common. This got to a point where the term "Eurojank" (a portmanteau of "European jankiness") was used by game players to describe these titles, with some bemoaning the lack of Eurojank in more modern titles.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Other</span>
</p><ul><li> Chinese products tend to have this reputation. Due to their massive labor pool and limited government oversight, China became a powerhouse of low-cost production, resulting in a massive proliferation of low-cost, low-quality manufacturing. Poor oversight and complex supply chains has resulted in everything from tainted food and drink to counterfeit parts. There's been a substantial effort to change this reputation, and transition to a center of high technology production (much like what happened in Japan and Taiwan starting in the 1960's). Whether this effort will be successful remains to be seen.
<ul><li> There was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">urban legend</a> about a town in China (or wherever) that changed its name to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Usa</a>" so they could stamp and tag their products as "MADE IN USA"
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1920s and early 1930s, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardAdams">Richard Adams</a> was growing up, Made In <em>Germany</em> was considered this in Britain. The phrase "On the Fritz" for products that are broken may be related to this.
<ul><li> This reputation was acquired in the mid-19th century, when producers in many rising industrialized countries trying to catch up with Britain made cheap, inferior copies and imitations of British products, including quite a number of British firms. This became an embarrassment to German industrialists, especially after a German adjudicator remarked that the German products shown at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia (1876) were in the majority "cheap and bad". This led to efforts to rectify the situation by raising industrial standards and instilling a greater sense of pride in their products among German firms. At the same time, inferior German products (also, apparently, the protectionist measures adopted by the German government) led the British parliament to enact the Merchandise Mark Act of 1887, which made it obligatory to mark wares with their country of origin. However, as just then the Germans were bringing their house in order and increasingly started to export products that were of as good or better quality than British ones or produced more cost-effectively, the Merchandise Mark Act backfired and the "Made in Germany" tag intended as a mark of shame came to be regarded as a mark of quality the world over and a matter of national pride in Germany. (The centenary of the imposition of the "Made in Germany" mark thus was commemorated with a special postage stamp in West Germany in 1988). However, as Richard Adams' example shows, old attitudes die hard, which can be seen as Britain living in a false sense of Victorian complacency, which may actually have been a disadvantage vis-à-vis the German competition.

<ul><li> The automobile industry is simply awash in this trope, but usually inverted, with companies producing elegant luxury goods outside their home region and more modest products within. In the United States, German companies are known for producing dazzling luxury cars, VW notwithstanding. Within Europe, however, Mercedes-Benz also makes <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_A-Class">economy cars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Citaro">buses,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which would surprise Americans but wouldn't get a second glance from Europeans. And then you see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/violinsoldier/222168946/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> rolling down a dirt path in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in America, aside from the occasional sports car (like the Corvette or the Ford GT) and Cadillac's V-series sport sedans, American automakers are known for trucks, family sedans, inexpensive muscle cars, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HummerDinger">luxo-barges</a>. Australia and Europe have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/ford-fg-falcon-g6e-turbo.htm">models like this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Here are a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-american-cars-not-sold-in-america.php">few more<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> American cars Americans in the States don't get to buy. Japan is a notable exception, with relatively few European or American high end luxury models but fleets and fleets of practical consumer cars.
<ul><li> And now Chrysler is trying to invoke and invert this, starting with an ad spot featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a> during the 2011 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>: 'Imported from Detroit'.
</li><li> The current "Ypsilon" car model sells in the UK under the US Chrysler brand and is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD1TPq3KBfQ">advertised<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with voiceover and music clearly trying to evoke the US. In truth, it's a European-designed, Polish-built car sold in most of Europe under the Italian "Lancia" brand(!) by Fiat, who now own both.
</li></ul></li><li> British cars produced en masse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">cranked this trope</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the 1970s, and never fully recovered. Before then, they were among the world's best. See also the True Art Is Made in Country X below.
</li><li> French cars have never really had a good reputation since the 2CV, a classic example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">Some joke that rubbish cars are the only ones the French can be trusted with.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> For quite some time, Canadian cartoons suffered from this sort of reputation, especially if they used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">Toilet Humor</a> or weren't from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a>.
</li><li> Belgian houses. To the point that they are the first thing that come up if you type in the word "ugly" in a search engine.
</li><li> North Korean spaceships. To a lot of people NADA (National Aerospace Development Admisinistration, pretty much the North Korean equivalent of the NASA) is Spanish for nothing. If your space program has a 20% chance of success there is a reason why foreign countries use your spaceship for a laughingstock.
</li><li> Some companies whose products are manufactured overseas (especially in China, India, Indonesia, etc.), will proudly say on the package <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselWords">"Designed in [Insert First World Country Here]!"</a> This, of course, means nothing, because regardless of where the product was <em>designed</em>, it's where it was <em>made</em> that matters to most people, but companies are hoping customers will think the product was built in the same place it was designed and therefore be of better quality.
</li><li> German cinema gets this sometimes, thanks to people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a>, who exploited a (now thankfully closed) German tax loophole nicknamed "stupid German money" that made people rich off of money-losing movies.
</li><li> Houses in Europe are made from stone and/or concrete and built to last generations and are often handed down to the next generation. Houses in the US are often made of wood and bought and sold like underpants. That explains the surprised reactions many Europeans have when seeing what "a bit of wind/floodwater/earthquake" does to American houses. Note that this does not apply to a lot of the housing stock in older U.S. cities (e.g. the famous brownstones of New York and rowhouses of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and D.C.), which (like European houses) are often built of stone or at least sturdy brick, and last for decades upon decades (centuries is generally an overstatement given the relative youth of even the oldest U.S. cities).

</li><li> Ironically, NYC has a substantial Mexican population, making said commercial... a little unfair. Also, Pace has been owned for several years by Campbell Soup...which is also based in New Jersey.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Made in America" logo in ads, though that one tends to be less a boast of quality and more an appeal to patriotism.
<ul><li> "Made In Australia" logos are meant to be both a boast and an appeal to patriotism, especially when related to food.
</li></ul></li><li> Coffee producers often boast that their beans come from Colombia, Kenya, or Costa Rica.
</li><li> Produce sold in the U.S. often advertise that they are from one of the U.S. states that usually produce that produce. For example, "Florida oranges," "California oranges," "Georgia peaches," "Washington apples," "Michigan cherries," "Washington cherries," "Michigan apples,"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2vnkg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2vnkg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2vnkg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You laugh, but this is a thing</span> "New Jersey blueberries," "Jersey tomatoes"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note316ik');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note316ik" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note316ik');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Grown in New Jersey, these are always called "Jersey tomatoes."

<ul><li> Some such commercials come across less as "it's from state Y, so you know it's good" and more "the Y state X lobby is desperate for you to buy their X. Please. It doesn't totally suck." Ads for California cheese tend to feel this way, at least if you grew up in some other part of the US (i.e. most of it) where Wisconsin is usually regarded as the premium source for dairy products generally and cheese in particular, followed by Vermont and Upstate New York (which is practically Vermont).

Although this is less the case now, you still find that the menus in any high-class restaurant of other cuisines frequently describe dishes using French terms; <em>jus, timbale, coulis, entree</em>. Of course, part of this is that the French were the first nation associated with international "<em>cuisine</em>", so they called naming rights, like musical notation all being Italian.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This extends to products named after a region of origin and known for their quality; appellation laws permit such products to be thusly named only if they're genuinely made there. You can't call it Champagne, Parmesan (well, Parmigiano), or Scotch unless it's actually from there.
<ul><li> Not all appellation laws apply internationally; the above is the case within the EU but in the US "California champagne" widely sold as such and Parmesan is domestic by default.
<ul><li> That's because the authentic Parmesan is called Parmigiano-Reggiano. Knock off brands will still use "Parmesan."
</li><li> By the same token, the US signed an agreement with France and the EU in 2006 to enforce French/EU law concerning champagne, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a> allowing brands of sparkling wine which had established use of "champagne" in 2006 to continue to do so as long as they very clearly labeled their bottles as [PLACE OF ORIGIN] champagne with the [PLACE OF ORIGIN] in very large letters.
</li></ul></li><li> Within the United States, Tennessee whiskey must be made within the borders of the State of Tennessee; this has been confirmed by at least one international agreement (namely NAFTA). Also, bourbon whiskey—which also has a good reputation as a better-made product — must be made within the United States.
</li></ul></li><li> Italian olive oil is treated like this, though an awful lot of the famous firms buy their oil from other countries in bulk quantities (usually Greece or Spain). A not insubstantial amount is cut with other oils and produced by companies run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. No, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19896_the-6-creepiest-lies-food-industry-feeding-you_p2.html">seriously<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, many pasta manufacturers now buy their wheat from the U.S. (North Dakota specifically), but they continue to use Italian imagery because it sells better.
</li></ul></li><li> Prestigious American microbreweries like North Coast Brewing Co. and Dogfish Head are all the rage among (American) beer snobs, to the point where beer drinkers anywhere will tell you: If you want <em>interesting</em> beer, go to America. We can't guarantee quality, but that is where the experimentation is. Within the US, certain regions have reputations for either consistent quality or consistent inventiveness; Washington and Oregon (which are near America's biggest hops fields) are most prominent, but Michigan (which has some of the most successful craft breweries and draws on the state's agricultural bounty and abundant supply of clean water) and California (one of the early centers of the craft beer movement) are also highly reputable.
<ul><li> This also rings true of craft beers in other New World nations like Australia and New Zealand.
</li></ul></li><li> While the status of Canadian technology and manufacture goods is dubious, the quality of a natural resource is generally assured when you're told that it was grown, mined, raised, et cetera, in Canada. This is mostly because Canada is the most developed of the world's various resource-rich nations, with more sophisticated processing facilities and much stricter quality control policies than almost anywhere else.
<ul><li> Ores refined in Canada are generally regarded as incredibly pure. The Canadian Gold Maple Leaf is the purest form of gold in the world.
</li><li> Canadian fish is generally touted on menus; especially freshwater fish, salmon or cod, as is Canadian livestock, as most stock is grain-fed, rather than corn-fed, which most agree tastes better.
</li><li> The quality of Canadian resources has been celebrated since the nation's inception. The whole country was basically founded on the quality of Canadian beaver pelts, turned into fancy hats, and later, Canadian trees were said to form every mast in the Royal Navy (the Navy had been sourcing its masts and other shipbuilding materials from the Thirteen Colonies, but when that relationship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">went south</a>, Canada picked up the slack).
</li><li> Forestry is still a major part of the nation's economy, especially in the province of British Columbia. It's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for American loggers and lumber producers, such that the US and Canada have been involved in a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada-United_States_softwood_lumber_dispute">long-running trade dispute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> over it, the US accusing Canada of subsidizing its lumber industry to give it an unfair advantage and Canada, fully in keeping with this trope, asserting in response that its lumber industry is just better-run and that American tariffs are giving <em>them</em> an unfair advantage.
</li></ul></li><li> Argentinian beef is regarded as some of the world's finest. Other cattle breeds that get this treatment are wagyu cattle of Japan (which gives us Kobe beef) and the Scottish Aberdeen Angus. American-style Kobe beef was created by crossbreeding wagyu and Angus cattle.
<ul><li> Irish beef has a very good reputation worldwide as well, with Ireland being the only EU country currently allowed to export beef to the United States.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> comes in the form of Stilton cheese. Stilton cannot be made in the village of Stilton in Cambridgeshire, as it must originate in Derbyshire, Leicstershire or Nottinghamshire.
</li><li> American fast food, particularly of normal restaurants instead of food chains. If you want a good, heavy, greasy meal, you want an American mom-and-pop diner/restaurant/whatever. Also, with the emphasis on "fast," America is rather unique in having a whole culture around food trucks.
<ul><li> For plenty of Europeans the fast food that is considered the best is the Italian one. Aside from codifying all of the conventions of fast food that the US would continue further building upon it manages to give us stuff such as a pizza, an ice cream or an Espresso, which are all delivered in a fast pace while still delivering a product of high quality. The same can not be said about the US fast food, which for many Europeans is a dark factory of mass production.
</li></ul></li><li> Irish milk and butter. It's been joked that the Austrian government liked it so much that they traded Steyr AUGs for it.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Automobiles</span>
</p><ul><li> Vehicles from Australia, especially four-wheel drive trucks or sport utility trucks, are generally described as being made to survive "harsh Australian conditions". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">All the deadly animals and so forth</a>.
</li><li> In an inversion of the situation with all other consumer autos, most Americans won't take a <em>truck</em> seriously if it's made by a Japanese automaker. To them, the only <em>real</em> trucks are made by Ford, GM and Chrysler — or rather, <em>one</em> of those three, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">depending on who you ask</a>.
<ul><li> Ironically, the Texas-built Toyota Tundra has been <a class="urllink" href="http://www.torquenews.com/1083/2014-toyota-tundra-rated-more-american-chevy-silverado-ram-1500-and-gmc-sierra-pickups">ranked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as more "American" than the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra, which are built mainly in Guadalajara, Mexico and have fewer American-made parts in them. And the most American-made vehicle of them all? <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/06/29/whats-more-american-than-a-ford-f-150-pickup-try-a-toyota-camry/#51238aea4ed7">The Toyota Camry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a car that is otherwise synonymous with the <em>Japanese</em> auto industry.
</li><li> Of course, these people are forgetting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Toyota Hilux</a>, the only vehicle that has ever been driven <em>to the North Pole</em>. Granted, the American version (the Invincible) is much less impressive.
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese cars have long been seen as being built at an untouchable standard of quality, although the scandal over the Toyota recall (and previously the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_motors#Vehicle_defect_cover-up">Mitsubishi defects issue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) has tarnished this image. Japanese (and Korean) cars also have a reputation of being prime targets of theft since they tend to use parts that also fit into other makes and models.
<ul><li> There was a big issue over whether the first American-built Japanese brand cars in the 1980s would maintain their quality. It turned out the real problem wasn't American workers, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">American car company management.</a>
</li><li> Recent issues with Japanese cars have been due to them outsourcing parts to other countries. Many consider the inclusion of French-made parts to be a major cause of this.
</li></ul></li><li> In the US, this applies to German and British luxury cars and Italian sports cars.
</li><li> British cars were this before the 1960s, when most of them came under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">British Leyland</a> umbrella. See also Country X Art Ghetto section above.
<ul><li> That being said, Britain still maintains a place in the world of luxury and high-performance cars. Rolls-Royce and Bentley remain the gold standard in automotive luxury worldwide (the only automaker to come close within the past 20 years is Mercedes with its various attempts to revive Maybach), Aston Martin and Jaguar still produce fine luxury sports cars, Land Rover is still competitive in luxury SUVs, and both Lotus and McLaren make well-respected ridiculous racing/near-racing sports cars. Of course, of these, only Aston Martin and McLaren are entirely British anymore: Rolls is owned by BMW, Bentley is owned by Volkswagen, Land Rover and Jaguar are both owned by the Indian Tata Motors, and the Chinese company Geely owns Lotus. However, all retain enough British involvement to command that British panache (and the price tag that comes with it; of these brands, you won't see any new cars except the Jaguar and Land Rover for less than $100,000 U.S., and even those two typically go for around $50,000 for their entry-level offerings and $60,000-$70,000+ for the higher-end stuff).
</li></ul></li><li> In Europe, Fiat is a volume automaker like Ford or Volkswagen. In America, they market themselves on "seductive Italian design" and sell hot hatches like the 500 and roadsters like the 124 Spider,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4max2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4max2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4max2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is largely a restyled Mazda Miata, but we won't get into that</span> with their less sexy cars going to their corporate sisters at Chrysler and Dodge.
</li><li> Russian cars are usually nothing to write home about, but Russian <em>trucks</em> generally offer an excellent bang for the buck. They are usually quite spartan, but simple and reliable, with few things to break, and if they break, most anyone can fix them in any roadside garage. Small commercial trucks like GAZelle are selling like ice cream on a hot day around the less developed world, and KamAZ has built itself quite a name on the successes of its team in the rally circuit. But it's their off-road heavy-duty ones that are really best in the world. During the hurricane Katrina relief effort Mexican Navy Ural-4320 6×6's were reportedly brought to the streets of the New Orleans, because no other truck could come through.

In Brazil, seeing youngsters disregard their local and still very competitive tournament for European teams is a point of contention (including the term "Playstation Generation", claiming many fans only like the European teams after playing much <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer">FIFA Soccer</a></em>, <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager">Football Manager</a></em>).
<ul><li> Because different countries tend to follow different doctrines in regards to tactics, players that come from said countries tend to be more specialized in certain roles, making them more valuable than players from other nations in certain positions:
<ul><li> Italian goalkeepers at actual goalkeeping. German ones for ball control with the feet.
</li><li> Italian defenders, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">good defensive system</a> is the core of the Italian school of football.
</li><li> Spanish or German playmakers. The former for creativity, the latter for efficiency.
</li><li> Brazilian wingers or attacking midfielders, due to speed and rapid dribbling.
</li><li> Argentinian strikers, with very offensive football being valued in the country.
</li><li> For the clubs themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams">British Footy Teams</a> probably hold the most prestige overall due to the sheer popularity and money granted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">English Premier League</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">Basketball</a> is easily the most competitive of the world, with the best players of the game being Americans themselves.
</li><li> American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Baseball</a> is also the most competitive scene in the world, and many of the best players are Americans. However, players from certain Hispanophone Caribbean countriesparticularly the Dominican Repiblic, Cuba, and Venezuelaalso have a reputation for excellent and hardworking players (and fanatical fans).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a> is a notoriously exclusive club. It's been said that in the world there are the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Six_(ice_hockey)">Big Six nations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and everyone else. In the whole history of international Ice Hockey only ~10% of the World and Olympic championships were won by the teams outside of this club.
<ul><li> Canadian players. Justified as they invented the contemporary version of the game, which is also the country's national sport.
</li><li> US is basically a co-founder of the sport, as the first, oldest and most famous league  the NHL  actually spans both US and Canada.
</li><li> Russians. Famous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">their rivalry with the Canadians</a>, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in both nations, and dominating the European drafts of the NHL.
</li><li> Czechs are also quite prominent in the game, and their national team also has a bit of the rivalry going on with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Red Machine</a>, often to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> both on and off the ice. Not that the Canucks are not partial to the good scuffle themselves.
</li><li> Swedes and Finns round up the European four, with the Finns being notorious for never winning an Olympic gold in their whole history, but still being regarded as good players.
</li></ul></li><li> Russia, Canada, Japan <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56369');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note56369" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56369');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuzuruHanyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuzuruHanyu">Yuzuru Hanyu</a> is the most high-profile Japanese skater (as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> due to his multiple broken world records and consecutive medals) but the rest are catching up to him. He trains in both Canada and Japan, but his coaches' home base is the Toronto Cricket, Skating, and Curling Club.</span>, and the United States are the top four countries to produce gold medalists. That said, both the U.S. and Russia are slipping.
</li><li> Jamaican, Kenyan and Ethiopian track &amp; field Runners and marathonists are among the best of the world. There is some indication that both cultural aspects (many people in Ethiopia regularly walk long distances in high altitudes) as well as genetic aspects play a role in this, but interestingly enough the countries that are good at long distance running are mostly in East Africa and the people who are good at sprinting are mostly of West African descent (either born and raised in West Africa or descendants of West African slaves).
</li><li> For obvious reasons the best players of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a> come from the USA and to a lesser extent Canada with places like Mexico, Japan or <em>the entirety of Europe</em> somewhere down the line. This is so pronounced that most European leagues of American Football actually limit the number of "Americans" per team in lieu of a salary cap.
</li><li> The best surfers in the world come from Australia, Brazil or the USA, Hawaii in particular for the latter due to the huge importance surfing has in its culture.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RugbyUnion">Rugby Union</a> players from Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Ireland, Wales, England, Scotland and South Africa.
</li><li> In practically all women's sports, the Americans are top dogs by a wide margin, even sports that Americans aren't known for such as Euro Footy. Softball was once an Olympic event until the American team played a perfect Olympics — not giving up a single run in the entirety of an Olympic Games. Such was the dominance of the Americans that the game was removed from the Olympics.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Other</span>
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">German</a> and Japanese products. Also may extend to countries with German-speaking populations like Switzerland and Austria.
<ul><li> For photographers, all the best stuff is Made in Germany or Made in Japan. The knock-offs of the German stuff<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6wlzz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6wlzz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6wlzz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some of them as the <a class="urllink" href="http://vintage-camera-lenses.com/helios-44-2-58mm-f2/">Helios-44<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lens, a cheap, mass-produced but well built, copy of the Zeiss <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotar">Biotar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,are highly appreciated today by artist photographers</span> are made in Russia (for some very interesting reasons pertaining to the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>), and the knock-offs of the Japanese stuff (including many many store-brand cameras using lens mounts varyingly similar to the Pentax K-Mount) tend to be Made in China. For what amazing photography innovations is the US known? Disposable cameras. Granted, disposables probably extended the use of film as an amateur/consumer medium by at least five years...
<ul><li> Note that bullet point applies only to <em>still</em> photography. The US is together with Germany the leader in film equipment, where the two major brands are Arri (German) and Panavision (American) and each is more or less the market leader on each side of the Atlantic. Panavision has dropped when it comes to digital cinema cameras, where Arri Alexa is the big favorite, but closely followed by American RED and having beaten out Japanese Sony (the previous king) which has made it's new model that might be the standard... Of course, Panavision gets the last laugh in the US though, as it's an integrated camera/lens manufacturer and rental house (to the extent that it sells none of its cameras) in a business where almost all the customers are rental houses anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Unsurprisingly, given the importance of good glass for camera manufacture, Germany and Japan are also highly regarded for the quality of their optical instruments (binoculars, microscopes, and the like). While German brands like Zeiss or Leica have been well-established since the start of the twentieth century, Japanese manufacturers built up their reputation after the Second World War, being imported under American brands for decades before names like Nikon, Olympus, and Pentax came to the fore. That said, an increasing number of their products are now sourced or wholly produced overseas, most notably in China, but also in other Asian countries such as Thailand or Malaysia.
</li><li> In the '70s, '80s, and '90s, Japanese electronics were considered the best, thanks to Sony's innovative Trinitron and Walkman products.
</li><li> Zigzagged with German tanks. On one hand, the Wehrmacht were the first to appreciate armour as a mobile, versatile weapon of war in its own right, when most other militaries saw them as either support weapons for the infantry or substitutes for traditional cavalry. They pioneered many features that have since become standard: the three-man turret and radio communication, along with the rear-engine mid-turret front-driver layout, which made their tanks far more responsive in combat. All of these factors offset some glaring qualitative and quantitative disparities and allowed the German military to achieve its stunning successes in the first three years of the war. However, their later (and rather more famous) designs like the Tiger I and II or the Panther tended to be over-engineered, difficult and costly to manufacture, and often unreliable, despite the superlative quality of their armament and armour. Post-war, the Leopard I and Leopard II have become something of a standard for tank design, being widely adopted by militaries around the world and more often than not setting the benchmark for firepower and mobility, if not always survivability.
</li><li> The Swiss and clocks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThirdMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThirdMan">the cuckoo clock may be the only thing they ever invented</a>, but damn they do it well...) And of course, Harry Lime forgot to mention <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Wenger-16999-Giant-Swiss-Knife/dp/B001DZTJRQ/">pocket knives.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Except that cuckoo clocks were invented (and are still mostly produced) in the Black Forest region of Germany, not Switzerland. Moreover, movements (mechanisms, that is) for most of the budget Swiss clocks and watches are made in Russia and Asia, and are purchased in bulk by Swiss watchmakers for casing and reselling.
</li></ul></li><li> Before Apple, it was Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhone">cell phones</a> that held this reputation during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, equipped with audio/video playback (including broadcast TV and radio), video cameras, 3G mobile broadband, instant messaging, email, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3">MP3</a> players, GPS navigation, and e-money services at a time when most Western cell phones (save for a few niche devices like the business-oriented BlackBerry and the youth-focused Danger Hiptop/T-Mobile Sidekick) stopped at text messaging and still cameras. Needless to say, Japanese <em>keitai</em> were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a> for many Western cell phone users. Unfortunately, they wound up being <em>too</em> advanced to run on the primitive cellular networks outside Japan, and so Japanese cell phone makers turned inward and focused on the domestic market almost entirely, allowing them to get caught completely off-guard by the smartphone revolution. The unique qualities of Japanese cell phones, and how they failed to catch on outside Japan, led to the term <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_syndrome">"Galápagos syndrome"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to describe it. On the other hand, the overreliance on the mobile phones has led to the Japanese almost missing out the Internet boom on the Oughts, as few Japanese owned a computer at home, due to the expense and cramped living spaces, only saved by the eleventh hour by the Internet-capable smartphones (incluning iPhone, of course) and cheap and plentiful laptops arriving mid-decade.
</li></ul></li><li> Many companies tell us that some food product or piece of technology is from a random European country (often Italy or Belgium for food, and Germany for technology) without any indication of why this is supposed to be a good thing. For instance, a Home Hardware commercial that advertises knives made of "German steel", which could mean anything from referring to the area around the city of Solingen, where high-quality knifes and related steel products have been made for hundreds of years, or simply being made with steel sold by a German intermediary.
</li><li> This also goes for the firearms industry. Some weapons are touted as having "European ergonomics." This is often a reference to shaped grips, stocks, and hand-guards, despite many European guns having down right horrible ergonomics or minimalist designs.
<ul><li> Generally speaking, if it's from Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, or the Czech Republic it can be expected to be of high quality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">If it's French, however....</a> Ironically, most of the Belgian weapons factories are based in the French-speaking Walloon parts of the country, and most famous guns to come out of Belgium were designed by either <em>American</em> John Browning, or his French-speaking student Dieudonné Saive. Joining these countries, Italy is well-known for quality handguns and shotguns.
</li><li> Russian weapons, especially AK-pattern rifles, are well-known for their durability and reliability under harsh conditions. The AK-47 in particular has a well-deserved worldwide reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Several UK adverts for Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo (a shampoo made to prevent hair loss) proclaims itself as "German Engineering For Your Hair", and tells you pretty much nothing about what it is (beyond being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">caffeinated shampoo</a>, being German, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandWagonTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandWagonTechnique">selling very well in Germany</a>) or why you would want it.
</li><li> Britain may be well the first country one thinks of upon the mention of '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Commandos</a>' (being the first country to form such units in the modern sense of highly-trained special forces).
<ul><li> The original spelling of the word was <em>Kommando</em>, light and mobile irregular Boer troops who made a massive impact on the British during the Boer War. So it was South Africa that first raised commando units, technically.
</li></ul></li><li> Cuban cigars, though other nations are starting to catch up. They held a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a> status for <em>decades</em> in the US as a result of the Cuban Revolution and the ensuing embargo.
</li><li> Egyptian cotton, famously soft, light, fine, and breathable thanks to the long fibers and other factors.
</li><li> Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">Manga</a>. Almost every non-Japanese work that uses a similar style results in people complaining that it's merely a cheap ripoff. While there are exceptions, they're far from the rule, especially with the indie video game boom.
</li><li> French animation is seen with the same prestige as anime, to the point where even popular anime production studios tend to hire French recruits and collaborate with the French animation scene. On the other hand, America seems to be the popular choice for non-conspicuous 3D animation.
</li><li> American films and cartoons, especially Hollywood productions. Only in the very beginning of the film industry was this untrue; the first center of film production was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a>, where the technology had been invented, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasEdison">Thomas Edison</a> developed a reputation as someone touchy about the patent to his machines, and other would-be filmmakers wanted to be very far away from him indeed. Around the same time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> devastated the nascent film industries of many European nations, such that it took decades to catch up. Ever since, Hollywood has been synonymous with big budgets and glamorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spectacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spectacle">spectacle</a> of a sort that only they could afford.
<ul><li> The lone exception is the French, who usually prefer either Japanese films or their own films over Hollywood. Hollywood-bashing is common there. (American cartoons still have the same reputation there, though.) The lone period of time when this viewpoint wasn't in effect was, ironically enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, which were seen by American film buffs as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>, seeing as how that decade marked the height of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FallOfTheStudioSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FallOfTheStudioSystem">Fall of the Studio System</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">French critics, however</a>, saw the works of filmmakers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord">John Ford</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasRay">Nicholas Ray</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHawks">Howard Hawks</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> as quietly revolutionary, especially in comparison to the output of the French film industry at the time. Their love of Hollywood cinema led to the emergence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchNewWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchNewWave">French New Wave</a>, whose innovations eventually came back across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond">The Pond</a> in the form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood">New Hollywood</a> movement of the late '60s and '70s.
</li></ul></li><li> Canadian cartoons also have this reputation at times, with certain Canadian animated series that broke through the "all Canadian cartoons are bad" reputation having become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> series or wildly popular.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britcom">British comedies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion">music</a>.
<ul><li> Do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimeyGoesToHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimeyGoesToHollywood">actors</a> count as a product?
</li></ul></li><li> "Made in New Mexico", for silver/turquoise jewelry assumed to be made by Native Americans.
<ul><li> Although this assumption is mostly based on the fact that if you buy it in New Mexico, the clerk you bought it from was almost certainly a Native American (and likely a woman), specifically to cause this assumption.
</li></ul></li><li> The high-end bicycle market is split between Japan (components), the US and Canada (Mountain, BMX, and hand-built steel frames), and Italy (racing bikes), Anything made or assembled in those countries is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">high dollar</a>, but most brands also source parts from China and Taiwan, as well as other Asian countries.
</li><li> Dutch bikes are considered a guarantee for quality in the parts of Germany that border to the Netherlands. They can be identified by the chain guard that goes <a class="urllink" href="http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n501/skarl1/kettinkast.jpg">all around the chain.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> Tanks have been long associated with the Soviet Union, which has not only often led the field in their design, pioneering or popularizing innovations such as high-powered diesel powerplants, autoloaders, smoothbore guns, and explosive-reactive armour tiles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">but also in sheer numbers produced</a>. Upon its introduction, the T-34 effectively rewrote the book by combining mobility, survivability, and firepower to a degree unmatched any other tank design at the time of its introduction, and continued to remain highly competitive until the end of the war. At the end of the war, the T-54 did the same by rendering existing heavy and medium tanks obsolete, becoming almost indisputably the first main battle tank, capable of fulfilling almost all functions expected of either type. Both of these are among the most produced armoured fighting vehicles in history, with respective total production figures of 84,000 and 100,000 (estimated).
</li><li> In the nineteeth century the United States was the go-to country for fast sailing ships. Clippers, while limited in cargo capacity, carved out a niche in transporting low bulk/high value goods like tea and opium or passengers, holding onto their crown as transporters until changing market conditions favoured bulk shipping, which in turn was served better by increasingly mature steamships.
</li><li> Up until about World War II, Britain was <em>the</em> place to order warships from. British made warships were made with a combination of a experience and some of the most advanced cutting edge naval tech in the world. Better yet, they would sell anything to just about anyone with the cash.
</li><li> British steel, specifically when Made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Sheffield</a>.
</li><li> Clydebuilt was, up until the mid 20th century, a byword for quality in British ship manufacture. Many shipyards operated along the banks of the river Clyde, particularly around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Glasgow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, and were considered so valuable that Clydeside became a key target in the Luftwaffe's bombing campaigns. The shipyards employed a great many people, leading to economic devastation when post-WWII competition with newer, cheaper shipyards outside of the UK forced many to close down. There are still a few shipyards surviving today, fabricating state-of-the-art vessels for the Royal Navy, and the term Clydebuilt can still be found being used as a mark of Scottish pride.
</li><li> Ironically (given present connotations, or perhaps not?) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> was known for highly-valued rare commodities such as silk, porcelain, and tea, such that the European Age of Exploration was largely driven by the desire to secure a direct sea route there, bypassing Ottoman control. Prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, it was also the centre of world manufacturing, in large part due to inexpensive labour costs, extensive water infrastructure, and lack of administrative barriers to internal trade. All of this not only enabled the production of the aforementioned commodities, which require considerable processing to be made into viable consumer goods, but also of other more common producst such as wooden furniture and lacquerware. Nowadays, while China is the leading producer of natural silk and tea leaves, it is no longer the only one, or indeed regarded as providing the best. This is particularly marked with porcelain, where the best examples generally come from either Europe or Japan.
</li><li> Each Apple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IProduct">iProduct</a> is marked on the back as "Designed by Apple in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a>" right above the legally mandated "Made in China" disclosure, what with California (Silicon Valley specifically) being associated with modernism and high technology. Old-school computer nerds will tell you, though, that it is all at the expense of the true core of the computer innovation — that is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland">New England</a>, which, with its MIT-centered computer industry, was a forefront of innovation in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MainframesAndMinicomputers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MainframesAndMinicomputers">Mainframes and Minicomputers</a> era until overshadowed by those Californian upstarts because of the microprocessor boom, a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">dumb corporate blunders</a>, and (according to recent legal/economic analysis) the different approaches Massachusetts and California take on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause">covenants not to compete<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Massachusetts enforces them strictly, California refuses to enforce them at all), which affects the ability of talent to start new companies.
</li><li> For a long time, Japanese video games were considered the best in the world, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The8BitEraOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The8BitEraOfConsoleVideoGames">The 8 Bit Era Of Console Video Games</a> (coming right off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a> all but wiping out American home console development) up through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">the Sixth Generation</a> in the early '00s. While successful Western developers did exist, they existed almost entirely in the PC sphere, a niche market compared to the Japanese home consoles that dominated the industry. Since then, Western developers have caught up, though whether Japanese or Western games are the better ones can depend on the game genre (for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> games are considered better if they're from Japan) and sometimes personal opinion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG">Eastern</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG">Western</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a> are basically separate genres now.
</li><li> Up until about 2010 or so when MadCatz made serious use of fan input to create their products, Hori corporation of Japan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> arcade joysticks were considered the top of the line product for serious players, and if you bought anything else, you might as well just throw it in the garbage. Of course, the reason MadCatz's sticks are considered good is because they are fitted with Japanese Sanwa parts, which might be getting a bit meta...
</li><li> Soviet Union/Russia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">spaceships</a>. First in business, still going. The Chinese space program appears to mostly follow the same steps, with a very similar ship, a very similar early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation">Space Station</a>, and an unmanned lunar rover, but it doesn't sell seats to NASA.
</li><li> English locomotives used to have an excellent reputation due to being the country in which they were invented. Today France, Germany, and Japan are regarded as the best in terms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighSpeedRail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighSpeedRail">High Speed Rail</a> rolling stock (though debates which one of those three is the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">can get heated</a>), and Switzerland has built itself a niche for regional rolling stock.
</li><li> Something that is true almost universally: any product, made in any country, will have at least a few defenders in that country on the basis of simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">national pride</a>, no matter the quality. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, American automakers frequently appealed to patriotism and supporting American workers as selling points in the face of stiff competition from the Japanese, with Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca so famous for his America-boosting that, for a time, there was serious talk of him running for President. Locally-grown foods also feature heavily in how a country, state, or region crafts its image; witness the pride that the Californians take in their wine, that Wisconsinites take in their cheese, that the French take in both, that Floridians take in their oranges, that Georgians (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgiaEurope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgiaEurope">those Georgians...</a>) take in their peaches, and that Idahoans take in their potatoes. This also factors into <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_substitution_industrialization">import substitution industrialization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where a government supports domestic businesses with the intent of reducing reliance on imports; while its effectiveness as an economic policy is mixed, it holds nationalist appeal for many politicians.
<ul><li> Import substitution has another important side: an industrially developed nation, whose products are widely bought around the wold, has an additional way to throw its weight around, by initiating trade wars with and imposing sanctions on countries that behave in a way it doesn't like. US in particular has been throwing sanctions right and left, and has initiated a full-on trade war with China, leading the tacit Russo-Chinese alliance to step up their import substitution campaigns.
</li></ul></li><li> The best precision tools like micrometers and laboratory equipment are held to be Japanese or European (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">German</a> or Swiss). Conversely, the best hand tools like screwdrivers, wrenches, and the like are held to be American.
</li><li> In the field of electronic measurement instruments and experiments automation, OTOH, the virtual monopoly is held by National Instruments and Keithley Instruments, both American companies. Knockoffs of their products are widely made worldwide, particularly in Russia and China, but theiy still set the standards.
</li><li> Before he became an actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/obvious-history-arnold-schwarzenegger-made-million-dollars-laying-bricks">his first million dollars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by playing to this trope. Shortly after arriving in California, he advertised a construction company he ran as "European bricklayers" and raised his price, and his once-struggling company soon attracted numerous orders from people expecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a>.
</li><li> However questionable the quality of Chinese products may be, it is an indisputed fact that they have been extraordinarily productive when it comes down to laying down infrastructure. As of 2019, China has the second largest road and rail network in the world; in terms of expressway length and electrification, it is second to none. This is all the more impressive when considering that it did not have any expressways until 1988, and that it was operating steam locomotives for regular passenger service as late as 2005.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ucki');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ucki" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ucki');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A few steam locomotives continue to be in operation as freight trains</span> Their ability to rapidly put down asphalt and rails is such that it has become an important component of its foreign development efforts — which many would consider as an attempt to project Chinese power and influence abroad, if not a form of outright debt trapping.
