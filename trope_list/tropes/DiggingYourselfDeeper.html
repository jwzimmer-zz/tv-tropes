Unfortunately for him, said actor is actually Shizuo's little brother, whom Shizuo is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">very</a></em> protective of, and he instinctively interprets the namedrop as an attempt to invade Yuuhei's privacy through him. Of course, since the poor sod doesn't know this, he just thinks Shizuo's suddenly angry because he <em>hates</em> Yuuhei — so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpinionFlipflop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpinionFlipflop">rescinds his previous statement and calls Yuuhei an asshole.</a> The only thing surprising about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">what happens next</a> is that the poor sod actually <em>survived</em>.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air">Air</a></em>, Yukito's explanation about why he was hugging Kano is like this and leads to Hijiri getting angry and charging him with scalpels. Luckily, Misuzu's intervention means that Hijiri's reaction is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows">The World God Only Knows</a></em>, Keima has an accidental pervert moment with Haqua with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">predictable</a> result despite him not even really caring. A bit later, he reassures her by saying he has no memory of her naked body anyway. This might help normally, only Haqua is already bothered by the way he never shows attraction to anyone or anything outside of his games. Cue getting hit again.
</li><li> A dramatic example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HappyYarouWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HappyYarouWedding">Happy Yarou Wedding</a></em> when a drunken makeout session is suddenly halted by Yuuhi and Todou fears he's made him uncomfortable and lies that he mistook him for his dead wife. Since Yuuhi had stopped because he was shocked to realize he was in love with Todou, this crushes him and he decides to never return. Todou then persistently texts him with messages like "I have no interest in men" and "sorry for making you feel bad" in attempt to get him to come back, but of course, this just makes Yuuhi even more upset.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em>, Mamimi confronts Naota and accuses him of having a crush on Haruko, to which Naota replies, "How can you like someone who's insane?" The problem is that Mamimi is a pyromaniac arsonist, and Naota knows this.
</li><li> Kurando Wada falls victim to an exaggerated case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopcornAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopcornAvatar">Popcorn Avatar</a></em>. Thanks to a previous incident when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">a bump to the head</a> made him regress to the hyperactive, skirt-flipping personality he had as a 9-year-old, all the girls in his class start treating him like he's a dangerous pervert. He assures them that he has no interest in what's under their clothes, which they automatically take as an insulting comparison to Lisa Vayu. He immediately counters that he doesn't even like big breasts, only for Lisa to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe">put a hand on his shoulder</a> right after he says it. While she's painfully punishing him for that, he tells her she has the best breasts in the world... just when his sister happens to walk in looking for him.

Naturally, Hak declined.

<div class="indent"><strong>Marinette</strong>: (<em>throwing the magazine down on his desk</em>) <em>This</em> is whats going on in here, Adrien. This racist pile of crap that your father helped produce. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: (<em>glances at the magazine and recognises the photos, before turning back to Marinette</em>) Youre upset over a fashion spread in Mᴏᴅᴇ? I dont see what the big deal is; I mean, none of it is lewd or anything. I guess this collection isnt my fathers best work... <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Oh, its an awful collection; completely uninspired and cliché. But I wouldnt be half so upset if an Asian designer had been behind a shoot supposedly inspired by an Asian holiday. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: There probably werent any Chinese designers that were high profile enough. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Do you honestly believe the words coming out of your mouth? I can name three Chinese designers off the top of my head that have been members of Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. There are tons of other Chinese designers that participate in Paris Fashion Week. One of them, Ms. Min, even puts out a collection every year in honor of Lunar New Year. The Met Gala, you know, the premier fashion event in the world? It was teeming with work from Chinese designers last year - four of whom were featured in the exhibit! <em>Your father</em> has never caused such a sensation as Guo Peis fox fur gown, and he sure as <em>hell</em> has never been featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gabriel doesnt make art; if this is anything to go by, all he makes is racist garbage. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: (<em>stands up and glares at her</em>) Its not like he could control who Mᴏᴅᴇ asked to do this spread. They chose the person they thought had the best collection for what they wanted to portray. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Gabriel Agreste could have easily turned them down if he had the decency to see that what Mᴏᴅᴇ was doing was wrong. Of course, that would require him to realize that his collection was racist trash and that Mᴏᴅᴇ clearly wanted to portray racist trash. (<em>turning the pages over, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedPounding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedPounding">Punctuated Pounding</a></em>) How. Else. Can. You. Explain. This? (<em>finishes on a shot of Adrien</em>) It wasnt enough that they whitewashed my culture, was it? They also had to deck their white models in yellow face. (<em>glaring into his eyes</em>) What made you think that this was in any way okay? How can you claim to be my friend and do something like this? <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: Hes my father; I couldnt just say no. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Your relationship to him is precisely why you were the only one who <em>could</em> say no. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: (<em>bitterly</em>) You really have no clue about how wrong you are there. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: I know that any other model or member of the production crew would have committed career suicide if they confronted him. Just as your father was in a position to turn down Mᴏᴅᴇ without consequences, you were in a position to call him out without ruining your future career. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: Youre crazy if you think I wouldnt have faced consequences, Marinette. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: What, youd be grounded? Lose your video game privileges? No sweets for a month? Do you really care more about some petty personal comforts than doing the right thing? <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: The right thing? This isnt some grand moral conflict. Youre overreacting. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Spoken like a truly privileged white man. Your father must be so proud. <br/><strong>Adrien</strong>: Dont act like such a martyr, Marinette. It's not like you're some oppressed minority - heck, your skin is even paler than mine. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: (<em>lets out a harsh and bitter laugh before cutting it off and continuing to glare at him</em>) You were right, Alya; white faves will <em>always</em> disappoint you in the end.

One of Emme's assistants, Justin, then chimes in with "And it's easy on the hips." Another assistant hastily bails him out by explaining that the cake is a low-density one that doesn't require a lot of processed sugar to hold it up.

Believing her to be Jane's girlfriend, he tells her that "you girls" have got "the best of both worlds." When pushed to explain what he's talking about, he uses a metaphor Jeff brought up earlier in the episode:

Not that you have irrelevant breasts! You've only got two, that's for sure. Unless you were some sort of cow. No! No, an attractive cow! Or a prize-winning cow! But you're not a cow. You're a person. But I'm sure that you'd be a prize-winning person if they had a sort of cattle market for women! A women market! Which, thinking about it would be a bad thing in many ways.

Basil thinks he's talking about sex ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">that's what it's all about to them!</a>") and gets all indignant and defensive. When he hears from his wife what the psychiatrist was in fact asking about, he rushes out with a plastered-on grin and starts babbling about how he thought he was talking about walks, not sex! NO, vacations! and coming off much worse than he started.

He was just giving examples of things he does when he's restless. Nothing corpse-specific in there.
<ul><li> Jayne's good at this, but Simon is the undisputed <em>master</em>. Especially if Kaylee's in the room. Heck, the fact that Simon does this is pretty much the reason he and Kaylee don't get together <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the movie</span>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Niles:</strong> Yes, and even if by some small chance that were to happen, Daphne, I could always use you. <br/>...I, I would know of a position you could take. <br/>...Services that you could perform. <br/>...I would know of an opening. <br/>...This is on me.
</div><ul><li> Speaking of <em>Frasier</em>, this is the formula for a lot of episodes; a conflict arises, and each attempt at a resolution digs the characters deeper. Some (if most) episodes even end without any resolution at all and show the characters wallowing in self pity in their inability to come to a resolution.
</li></ul></li><li> Seen in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> episode "The One Where Ross Can't Flirt", in which Ross's attempts to flirt with a pizza delivery girl degenerate into a lecture on the smell of gas and an intended compliment which makes Ross <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile">sound like a pedophile</a>.
<ul><li> There was another one where he ended up talking about sewage.
</li><li> And Chandler brought up another occasion, when Ross talked about the Irish Potato Famine.
</li><li> Ross' failures at flirting cannot be emphasised enough. Another attempt led to the conversation derailing into asking two women if they had to choice, which method of dying would they preferred: being burned or drowning.
</li><li> Chandler also did this once, while attempting to suck up to Monica's parents.
</li><li> In the first season, Chandler one says to Monica that if they turn 40 and neither of them are married then they should marry each other. When Monica asks why she wouldn't be married by then, everything he then says just makes her angrier.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chandler:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Dear god, this parachute is a knapsack!</a>
</div></li><li> In one episode, Phoebe and Rachel start taking karate classes, and Ross tried to prove that they weren't as good as they thought they were by pretending to attack them. When they easily overpower him, he goes to their instructor for some pointers:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ross:</strong> I tried attacking two women. It did not work. <br/><strong>Instructor:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Ross:</strong> No, I mean... it's okay, I mean, they're... they're my friends. In fact, I, I, I was married to one of them. <br/><strong>Instructor:</strong> Let me get this straight, man. You attacked your ex-wife? <br/><strong>Ross:</strong> Oh, no! No, no! No, I tried. But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together?
</div></li><li> In the final season, Chandler accidentally reveals to a step-kid that he's adopted. Then he traumatizes the kid even worse by revealing Santa Claus isn't real. And this was already after he attempted to make a joke to the kid's foster parents about them being infertile. In all seriousness, he and Ross were made for this trope.
</li><li> Chandler comforting Phoebe after her heart attack in the hypothetical episode.
<div class="indent"><strong>Monica:</strong> Phoebe, a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow down. <br/><strong>Chandler:</strong> I always thought a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die. I mean you're not going to die. I mean you are going to die, but you're not going to die today. (Beat) I wish I was dead.

He's already in hot water for sleeping with a copy girl, but makes things even worse when he tries to salvage it by stating he was trying to keep Rachel from finding out about it the whole time.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rachel:</strong> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again!</a>"
</div></li><li> Variation in one episode where Rachel accidentally does this to Ross by mistakenly bringing up every single one of his failed marriages to the father of his date. Ross has already mentioned Carol and their son, and Paul replies, "I just didn't know you were married." At this point Rachel returns from the bathroom and assumes they were talking about his marriage to her, and she clarifies that it was just a big drunken mistake. Then she realises her mistake and asks if they were talking about Emily.

<ul><li> When he's refused alcohol at a pub, Will angrily complains that everyone else present is clearly underage. As a result, everyone gets kicked out.
</li><li> The roller coaster scene. Will is furious that most of the front row seats have been taken, even though his gang were queuing for them. Despite being told by his friends and the attendant to just sit down, he demands that the queue-jumpers be removed and calls them "inconsiderate arseholes". He then finds out he's just insulted <em>two men with Down syndrome</em>.
</li><li> And again at his work experience at the car garage. Although the staff attempt to pull a hazing prank on him, they aren't actually that unfriendly to begin with. But Will's cocky reaction to foiling the prank, as well as his continual complaining about being "too clever" for working at the garage, encourages them to pull an even worse prank on him.
</li><li> His worst moment comes when he breaks up with Kerry. He makes her upset and refuses to apologise, even after Tara tells him that her dad died the previous month.

</li><li> Most of the cast seems to be both aware and afraid of this trope, with one of the shows running gags providing many subverted examples of this: Many episodes have a short off-topic conversation between the team members after the opening, before they head out to the crime scene. Usually, it ends with one of the characters (mostly Tony) making an either ambiguous, sexist, or simply dumb statement, followed by a snarky comment from suddenly appearing Gibbs. Now, the character who made the statement will usually pick up the shovel and look for the right spot to start digging while stuttering, but eventually either put it down himself by simply shutting up, or have it taken from him by Gibbs ordering him to work.

"At one point I tried changing the subject to art. But we went from art to artists, to alcohol, to coffee... and that just led right back to poo!"
<ul><li> When she first tried talking to Jake, her boyfriend for twenty minutes in season 4, the only thing she could think of was to compliment him on what a perfectly square head he has.
</li><li> There was that one very early episode with Elliot and Carla feuding over Elliot tattling on Carla for not doing something. When Elliot apologizes and then doubles back to elaborate on her reasoning, the scene shifts to a visual gag of her standing in a grave literally "digging herself deeper"; as Carla and the other nurses look on in like the Mafia.

Lenneth bluntly informs him that no, she's just here to literally drag him to Hel (the Norse goddess) for his crimes in life. When Lenneth gives him the chance to come up with something redeeming, he remembers robbing and killing an old man, helping to kidnap someone, and spying on his own country. It's only at the last minute, when Badrach remembers literally one good deed (and even then, he did it mostly to get back at someone else) that Lenneth relents and takes his soul for Valhalla. Nor surprisingly, of the various einherjar that Lenneth recruits, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Badrach starts with the second-lowest score for suitability for entry to Valhalla</a>.

Then when the book was made into the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsLoveGotToDoWithIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsLoveGotToDoWithIt">What's Love Got to Do with It</a></em>, which destroyed his reputation once and for all, he responded saying "Sure, I've slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">But I never beat her</a>."
