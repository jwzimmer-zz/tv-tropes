Sayaka hears the gears starting to whir and is fast enough to jam the mechanism with her sword. Also, if you're in contact with her, as Mami was via ribbon during their fight, you're unaffected.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> for the homunculi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. Their immortality is fueled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Philosopher's Stones</a> in their bodies; Mustang tore Lust's out of her body attempting a one-shot kill, only for her to form a new body from the Stone. Turns out their only weakness is being killed a few dozen times (or the destruction of the Stone itself), with the exact number of "kills" required being dependent on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the number of human souls remaining in the Stone</span>.
<ul><li> Pride has one in the form of pure darkness: since he uses shadow-manipulation powers, he's powerless in total darkness because you need light to cast a shadow.
</li><li> Alphonse is bound to his armor by his blood seal, and should that be destroyed, he's a goner.
</li><li> Wrath's Ultimate Eye turns him into the equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI">Perfect-Play A.I.</a>: he can predict his opponents' moves with perfect accuracy and therefore wins almost every fight he's in effortlessly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even an Ultimate Eye cannot dodge something it cannot see coming.</span>
</li><li> Played straight for the homunculi in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the first anime</a>, where they are immortal, but can be killed if one gets anywhere near the remains of the human body they were created from. Wrath averts this because his remains were used as the raw materials in the attempt to resurrect him.
</li><li> Homunculi are also rendered immobile if the red nodes on their bodies are penetrated. This is shown in the manga where Wrath captures Greed by piercing his katanas into his nodes and Lan Fan throwing her kunai into Envys forehead. We also see this in the 2003 anime when Lust is punished and kept nailed to the wall.
</li></ul></li><li> The Zentraedi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Protodeviln</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> are both weakened by music - the Zentraedi because they haven't been exposed to "culture" for so long, and the Protodeviln because Basara possesses the Anima Spiritua.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> has several weaknesses:
<ul><li> Mazinger can't move without its pilot. So the bad guys constantly attack Kouji when he is out of Mazinger.
</li><li> Mazinger's main body must be combined with the Hover Pilder to work. Kouji's enemies often try to prevent him from attaching the Pilder to Mazinger's head.
</li><li> Mazinger's underwater mobility is crap, even after getting upgraded to fight underwater. Of course, this is exploited frequently.
</li></ul></li><li> Any character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> have fantastical abilities but with very heavy handicaps, more often than not forcing the characters to pull near-fatal trump card moves. The best example is one character of the main duo, Mido Ban, who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">subject people to dreams</a> with his Jagan (Evil Eye) for exactly one minute in reality, but indefinitely in the dream itself, making it an ultimate twink move. The catch? He can only use it once on a person and three times total a day. Needless to say, a lot of antagonists find ways to avoid this or force him to use his Jagan needlessly until he's helpless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>'s Shinigami, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">grim reapers</a>, are immortal with two notable exceptions. First, a Shinigami's lifespan is extended by writing names in a Death Note: if a Shinigami forgets to write names, they will run out of time and die. Second is the fact that a Shinigami who intentionally uses their Death Note to protect a human - extending someone's lifespan rather than cutting it short - will die instantly. There are also a number of rules they have to follow while in the human world if they don't want to get on the bad side of the Shinigami King. On a personal level, Ryuk is addicted to apples, and goes through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostFoodGrievance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostFoodGrievance">some awkward withdrawal syndromes if he goes for too long without eating any</a>. That said, Ryuk's withdrawal can't kill him, nor can starvation, as he doesn't really need to eat.

<ul><li> The team's main vehicle, The God Phoenix, has a rather poorly thought out weakness in that all the team's sub-vehicles have to be docked for the God Phoenix's weapons systems to work. While that kind of weakness would make sense to create the plane's Fiery Phoenix effect since it's an exotic weapon system, to have it affect the regular weapons seems too much. Even worse, Galactor learns about this weakness and the visual clues for it and wastes no time to take advantage of it.
</li><li> Another Achilles Heel turned out to be their uniforms. Each piece of their clothes - shirt, pants, and shoes - turn into their uniforms. Lose any part of it and you can't transform, as Jun finds out.

Furthermore, shooting them in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eyes</span> should be enough to kill them.
</li><li> Many times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>, more than one character suffers from this. Shiryu's main means of attacking leaves his heart wide open to attacks for a fraction of a second, something a few people notice over the course of the story. Krishna likewise was only defeated when Shiryu struck his hidden "Star Points", and the Pope of Sanctuary's astral projection attacks left his body wide open to attack.
<ul><li> The Pope's one is not as bad as the others, as he's smart enough to do it on targets that are far away from him and without the psychic powers you'd need to counterattack while staying in a well-guarded location. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">Then Shun revealed his chain would attack without missing if he had even a vague idea of who he had to attack,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">and the Astral Projection allowed the chain to hit him.</a> Then the Pope refrained from attempting it again in case Seiya, Shiryu or Hyouga pulled something like that.

However, once Inuyasha destroys the artist's inkwell — which turns out to be a <em>magic</em> inkwell — he's down and out.
</li><li> Inuyasha himself: On the night of a new moon, he becomes fully human and loses all of his demon powers.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em>Legend of Lemnear</em>. The Big Bad transforms himself into a 50 foot demon cyclops, and the male hero: The warrior of Bronze declares <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"You may be tough, but I know your weak spot!

<ul><li> Goku survives a bullet and an axe to the head (relatively) unharmed, but if you grab his tail, he'll pass out. Eventually he trains himself to not be unaffected by it. It even works when he's transformed into a giant ape. He also has a tendency of losing strength if he feels hungry, which results in his defeat in his first battle with Yamcha as well as his fight with Jackie Chun. Both weaknesses went away by the time he grew up, the former because he had his tail cut off, and the latter presumably because he got better at managing his metabolism.
</li><li> Goku and Piccolo themselves exploit this weakness in the battle with Raditz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. After that attempt failed, Goku didn't bother going for the weakness again, because he remembered that Saiyans could also manually detach the tail from the body. Attempted against Nappa and Vegeta, although Piccolo finds out rather brutally that the Elites aren't stupid enough to not train that weakness.
</li><li> Goku also doesn't have a good history as far as Paralysis-inducing techniques (more specifically, the telekinetic kind) are concerned.
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Goku manages to hold an edge over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">General Blue</a>, until the latter used his special power to freeze Goku's body. It's worth noting Blue nearly killed Goku no less than <em>three</em> times this way.
</li><li> When fighting Tien during the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament Chiaotzu manages to paralyze Goku several times, allowing Tien to score free hits on him.
</li><li> During his battle against Frieza on Namek, Frieza successfully imprisons Goku in a ball of energy and Goku is helpless to stop it until Frieza intentionally makes the ball explode. This one, however, could simply be chalked up to the fact Frieza was way out of Goku's league at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> Chiaotzu successfully restrains Goku for a few seconds using his power. Granted, Goku was only in his base form, relaxed, and Chiaotzu took him by surprise, but the fact that Chiaotzu can affected Goku for <em>any</em> length of time at all despite the massive, <em>massive</em> gap in power makes it clear it's still a soft spot for Goku.
</li></ul></li><li> Though debatably non-canon, the fourth DBZ movie revealed that Namekians were sensitive to a certain sound frequency. In this case, it's the sound of <em>whistling</em>. Piccolo flips out when Gohan whistles, but when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug">Lord Slug</a> has everyone on the ropes, he instructs Gohan to start whistling to stop Slug. Piccolo himself avoids the weakness by way of ripping off his own ears.

If he does, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">he will overheat to death</a>.

Except for the fact that he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">idiot</a> who needs a cheatsheet to remember spells. He also has trouble pronouncing Latin.
</li><li> Nagi's comrade Eishun is a more serious character who for his strong focus on his training means a lack of human contact, and therefore a difficulty with women. This seems a common trait in Shinmeiryuu swordsman if Setsuna is any indication. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Tsukuyomi</a> takes this weakness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">too far in the other direction</a>.

<ul><li> All Devil Fruit users have the common fatal weakness of becoming completely immobile and useless in deep water. Other fruits have more specific weaknesses; for example, Luffy's Gum Gum fruit makes him immune to blunt force, and can only be damaged by being slashed or pierced. On the other side of the coin, Buggy the Clown's fruit makes him immune to being cut, so his weakness is blunt force.
</li><li> The Logia Fruits, easily the most powerful of all the Devil Fruits, all seem to have a single weakness that negates their great power or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">perfect defense</a>. For example; Sir Crocodile, eater of the Sand Sand fruit, becomes solid when wet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">God Enel</a>, eater of the Rumble Rumble fruit, which gives him lighting powers strong enough to destroy the entirety of Skypeia, is made completely helpless when pitted against Luffy, who is made of rubber and doesn't conduct electricity (until he finds ways to attack Luffy indirectly). Logia Fruit users can also be somewhat physically harmed when up against someone with a powerful Haki, though if a Logia user has Haki of his own he can counter that attempt to bypass his intangibility (as seen when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whitebeard</span> uses a Haki-imbued attack against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Admiral Aokiji</span>). Logia users can also be hurt by someone whose Logia is more powerful than theirs in a similar area, such as Sakazuki's magma being hotter than Ace's fire.
</li><li> Franky is a powerful cyborg with superhuman defenses. Problem is, he did all of his enhancements himself, meaning that since he couldn't reach behind him to do anything in back, he's vulnerable to attacks from behind. Some of his moves therefore involve fighting with his back on the ground so that his weak point is harder to reach.
<ul><li> His genitals, especially his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">balls</a>, are his weakpoint as well.
</li></ul></li><li> A few Fruit users have additional weaknesses that keep them from being completely invincible. Bartolomeo has an upper limit to both the number of barriers he can create at once and the total area he can cover with them, and his barriers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">cannot stop sound</a>. Trafalgar Law's Fruit powers drain his stamina. Blackbeard's Logia powers draw in everything around him, so he can't dodge attacks. Some of Robin's techniques, such as making wings, are unusually tiring, and her generated limbs are considered part of her and thus make her vulnerable to any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">Touch of Death</a> sort of power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Big Mom's soul-infused constructs (known as Homies) are significantly more vulnerable to damage than she is, especially soul-targeting damage, and are also fairly disloyal and can be turned against her; either way, removing them from the equation can significantly neutering her damage output. On top of that, her soul-ripping abilities will simply not work on anyone that isn't afraid of her</span>.

</li><li> Ukitake contracted a lung disease when he was three years old. It was fatal, but his parents tracked down a mysterious holy being to beg for its intervention. It agreed to keep Ukitake alive on the condition that Ukitake repay that debt at a later date. Like Aizen and Ichigo, Ukitake has phenomenal reiatsu even by the standards of captains, but unlike those two, he cannot freely use it; it's tied up just keeping him alive. Despite this, he has made it to captain rank and is one of the longest-serving of all captains. However, his disease can debilitate him at unexpected moments, including in the middle of battle, making him unreliable on the battlefield - a fact that cost the life of his previous lieutenant, Kaien.
</li><li> Unlike all other beings (including humans), Quincies have no resistance to Hollows. While Shinigami and Humans can undergo Hollowfication, Hollowfication instead kills Quincies and destroys their souls. At best, a Hollow attack can have a permanent impact on the power level of a Quincy and his future descendents. Quincies therefore hunt Hollows as a matter of survival. Urahara uses this weakness against the Quincies who stole captain Bankais to restore the Bankais to their rightful owners. Even a tiny amount of Hollow energy can poison a Quincy's soul.
</li><li> Nine years before the story begins, Yhwach mass murders all the impure Quincies alive with a special power called Auswahlen. Despite being a child at the time, Uryuu is also targeted but mysteriously survives. Uryuu's apparent immunity to Yhwach's power makes Yhwach personally interested in Uryuu, although Uryuu struggles to figure out why. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Auswahlen kills Quincies by creating a silver blood clot in their bodies that de-powers them and kills them once it reaches their heart. Among the Quincies purged are Uryuu and Ichigo's mothers, Kanae and Masaki. Uryuu's father, Doctor Ryuuken Ishida, knows the secret to both Yhwach's and Uryuu's powers: Uryuu's immunity means that Yhwach cannot see into Uryuu's future while Yhwach will be fully de-powered for a single second if he ever comes into contact with the Auswahlen silver. Ryuuken's decision to autospy his wife's body to collect the silver enables a special arrow to be forged that Uryuu will be able to fire without Yhwach seeing it coming, but the act forever destroys his desire to be a Quincy. Ryuuken only reveals the secret when Uryuu is strong enough to fire the arrow without Yhwach foreseeing it and Ichigo is fast enough to act within that single second to kill Yhwach.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em>, it turns out the right knee where Black Lion and Blue Lion connect is the titular mecha's weak point. The enemy constantly bombards it when they find out about it before they're able to pull away and finish the fight before they lose the leg. However, in the end, they fix THAT weak point and put in <em>another weak point</em>! What the hell?!
</li><li> Many villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba">Yaiba</a></em> has this. For example, Bat-Man's weakness to sunlight, the Moon Bunnies' ears and Silver's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">eye</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Special</a></em>, Yellow's Virdian-blessed powers include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">healing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">minor telekinesis</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">Super Empowering</a>. All this sounds like it would make her an invincible Pokemon trainer, but while her powers <em>do</em> make up for her sub-par battling skills, using them too much runs the risk of her being forced into a deep sleep that cannot be externally disrupted. At one point she gets taunted into using her powers vainly as to get tired out faster.
</li><li> The Gundam Double Zeta, the title mecha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em>, is a powerhouse Mobile Suit armed with one of the strongest beam cannons made by that point. However, said beam cannon was such an energy hog that it would easily run itself out of power if continuously used.
<ul><li> Power consumption is a big problem in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> universe thanks to the N-Jammers preventing nuclear energy from being used. Many suits along the way have attempted to devise ways to extend Mobile Suit usage time, such as better versions of the Phase Shift armor and beam weapons that draw from external batteries. The Freedom and Justice are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> because they have N-Jammer Cancellers that allow them to use nuclear reactors, giving them effectively unlimited operation time. Likewise for Providence, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s mobile suit. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, N-Jammer Cancellers have been banned by treaty (since they also make it possible for nuclear warheads to be used), so yet another attempt to extend battery life is introduced: a technology that remotely beams energy from the mothership to the mobile suit for a quick recharge without needing to return to the hanger. And inevitably, the treaty banning nuclear power gets violated by all sides in the end.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray</a></em>, the Gerbera Straight katana was Lowe's answer to the power question - he couldn't risk using a beam saber and using a GINN's Heavy Sword used just as much power. His encounter with the blacksmith Un No leads Lowe to create the sword.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also the problem concerning the GN Drive Tau in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>. As the GN Drive Tau is a mass produced, but incomplete, version of the Celestial Being's normal GN Drives, it's missing a critical component to allow constant energy creation, thus it only has a limited amount when it's powered up and when it runs out, the suit's dead in the water. When a way is found to replicate the standard GN Drives' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trans-Am mode</a>, it allows for a considerable boost in output but also exacerbates the existing weakness of the GN Drive Tau, usually burning out the Drive in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>, the titular mecha had a blind spot caused by its Scramble Dash flight pack, allowing enemies to sneak up and capture it.

It's also generally accepted that Superman would lose all of his powers while exposed to red solar radiation, since the yellow sun is the source of his power though writers waffle about whether red sunlight instantly depowers him or if he gets gradually weaker as he uses up his stores of yellow solar energy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with the supervillain Doomsday. If you kill him, he comes back, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">immune to what killed him last time</a></em> (so, if you tossed him into space, he'd come back able to survive sudden changes in pressure; if you did it again, he wouldn't need to breathe the next time; and if you did it a third time, he might—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionSchmonvection">eventually</a>—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold">freeze</a>, or burn up, and come back immune to that).
</li><li> General Zod's associate Ursa has all the regular Kryptonian powers and weaknesses, but her eyes can't stand bright light. Knocking off her protective goggles will briefly stun her as she clutches her eyes in pain. The Eradicator (or at least when he reappeared after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a>'s death) was like that, too—he couldn't take Superman's body and ended up forging a new one with the room around him. It wasn't perfect and he couldn't take in light properly, hence his shades. It's because of this that his battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Steel">Steel</a> turned in Steel's favor—he knocked off his shades fighting back.

<ul><li> The unstoppable Juggernaut is highly susceptible to a mental attack. His costume includes a magic helmet that blocks telepathy, meaning that the bulk of most any fight against him is a desperate struggle to remove the helmet and then a telepath effortlessly dispatching him once that's accomplished. He's gotten tired of that and ended up making a skull cap made out of the same material as his costume so now they got two layers to fight off.

Extreme heat is also a notably unpleasant weakness of theirs. There's one time when Venom has been defeated by a lit <em>zippo</em>. <br/><br/>Conversely, Venom is Spider-Man's Achilles Heel. Since the Venom symbiote spent a good bit of time bonded to Spidey as his black costume, not only does it know all about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> (something that routinely saves Spidey's life by giving him a heads-up on an incoming sneak attack), it's also <em>immune to detection by it</em>, an immunity that extends to any host the symbiote is bonded to.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> example:
<ul><li> One of the best known is the exhaust port on the Death Star, through which an invincible planet-destroying space station can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">explode into an enormous fireball</a> because of a couple torpedoes from a small one-man fighter spacecraft hit its reactor and caused a chain-reaction explosion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> due the simple fact the exhaust port was extremely small (only two meters wide) and would throw <em>out</em> exhaust, meaning the shot was considered impossible until Luke (who is a Force sensitive) somehow managed to do it.
<ul><li> In the old EU, it's made the clear the Emperor was <em>pissed</em> there was such a flaw and the designer repeatedly killed, brought back to life, and then killed again before putting him to work on a perfected design. The second Death Star attempted to avoid this, by instead having lots of much smaller exhaust ports, too small to shoot into. Luckily, the heroes still had an Achilles Heel to exploit because Death Star II was only about 70% complete when they attacked, which included holes wide enough for them to fly right up inside the main reactor and torpedo it.
</li><li> In the new continuity, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> explains that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the flaw was deliberately added and laboriously hidden by a Rebel sympathizer, who was also the one who fed them the information they would need to exploit it.

Aside for being hit by anti-starship weapons (that aren't normally used on a planet precisely because they're too powerful), there're four ways to take them down: the 'neck' with the weapons and the cockpit is relatively unarmored, and concentrated fire will severe the vehicle from its guidance system; the armour, while tough, isn't so effective against a large projectile at high speed such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">kamikaze airspeeder</a>; as they move through legs, a tow cable may be used to 'trip' them; finally, their armour can't resist lightsabers (that, to be fair, cut through pretty much everything), and Luke took one down by opening a hole and throwing a bomb inside.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>, the aliens are vulnerable to Earth bacteria and viruses. While new beings likely wouldn't be vulnerable to earth's viruses, bacteria would be able to wipe out any species without an adapted (or adequate) immune system. This is because the different ways that bacteria and viruses work. While it's stated to be the common cold in the movie, it could just be a "sinus infection" (bacterial). Any alien species moving to a different planet would be highly vulnerable to any and all new bacteria. This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, since the movie came out three years before the cause of the common cold was discovered.

The original point of the One Ring was for Sauron to gain control over the leaders of Men, Elves, and Dwarves, to whom he had (while in disguise) given the other rings of power. He <em>had</em> to put most of his strength into the One Ring in order for it to be powerful enough to control the others, especially the three Elven rings.
</li><li> Then there's Smaug, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>. He knew that dragons typically have a weak underbelly, but had rolled around in his hoard for so long that coins and gems had become embedded among his scales, creating a "diamond waistcoat" that made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>.

Then, Snape protects Harry and helps him to the best of his ability due to his love for his mother (his mistreatment of him comes from his being a look-a-like of James Potter) during all the books. Later, Harry sacrifices himself so that his friends and schoolmates don't die (and thus casts upon them the same shield his mother cast upon him). Much later, Narcissa lies to Voldemort about Harry being alive because she wants to see her son Draco (which is the signal that they are fed up with how Voldemort has treated her). And, in the end, it's Harry's ability to work with all of his friends that allows them to defeat the Death Eaters. There is also his reliance on and treatment of the horcruxes. They were supposed to prevent him from dying, and they accomplished that perfectly well. The problems were that: a) He was very lax with their protection at times (giving the diary to Lucius Malfoy, for example), because he had so many, and b) He couldn't tell when they were destroyed and so left his guard down.

<ul><li> In "The Moonbase", Cybermen were weak against solvents, or as the Doctor would later put it, "cleaning fluid".
</li><li> Cybermen were also given an Achilles Heel in the story "Revenge of the Cybermen": gold dust would asphyxiate them. This was not a tremendously damning weakness, since gold is neither common nor easy to form into an effective weapon. In "Revenge of the Cybermen", the Cybermen were Nigh Indestructible even on a <em>planet made entirely of gold</em>, because the locals didn't have the technology to make an effective delivery system for the gold. As the series progressed, gold was promoted to Kryptonite status: in "Earthshock", the Doctor injures, but does not incapacitate, a Cyberman by grinding a gold badge into its chest, but by "Silver Nemesis", Cybermen can be killed by lobbing gold coins at them, or shooting gold-tipped arrows. Gold-tipped arrows are very effective against Cybermen, but, of course, totally ineffective against anything else. It is sometimes joked that had the original series gone on, it would eventually have been possible to destroy a Cyber-war-fleet just by <em>saying</em> "gold" at them. After the show was revived in 2005, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">a fake website connected to the revival's second series</a> hints that the Cybermen seen in "Rise of the Cybermen" and later episodes had the gold weakness worked out in the prototype stage. It was showed on a computer screen in that episode that the weakness had been worked out. Though not present in the Cybermen themselves, the older programming of the Cyber-Planner in "Nightmare in Silver" made it temporarily shut down when a golden ticket was placed against it. The latter story also revealed this weakness to be a software error, rather than a hardware one.
</li><li> In addition, the Cybermen have been vulnerable to emotions in several appearances.

They also couldn't climb stairs due to their flat bases and gliding motion, which was made fun of outside the universe and sometimes even in it. However, <em>Remembrance of the Daleks</em> managed to bring a whammy subversion by showing Part One ending with an Imperial Dalek ascending a flight of stairs, ready to <strong>EX-TER-MIN-ATE</strong> the Doctor. From that point on, all Daleks could levitate.
</li><li> The Macra were helpless without their special gas (which made one wonder how they managed to force humans to start making it in the first place).
</li><li> The Ice Warriors are vulnerable to (what else?) heat.
</li><li> The deadly sea weed of <em>The Fury from the Deep</em> were vulnerable to Victoria screaming (luckily, she was good at it).
</li><li> Autons are also vulnerable to solvents and high-frequency noises.
</li><li> The Nestene Consciousness is susceptible to "anti-plastic" and, like its minions, high-frequency noises.
</li><li> The "Seeds of Death" are (ironically) vulnerable to water.

</li><li> The Fendahleen are vulnerable to salt.
</li><li> The giant octopus Kroll was vulnerable to... a small stick. Okay, a <em>special</em> stick.
</li><li> The Mara is (are?) vulnerable to mirrors and happy thoughts.

</li><li> The Master leaves himself vulnerable to happy thoughts in "Last of the Time Lords". In addition, his biggest weakness throughout the series is... the Doctor, the one person he's never fully understood.

What makes this a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example is that not only is there no indication of this vulnerability until the next to the last episode of the show, but what could have been a very cool mythologically resonant plot point is instead wasted twice over: the person who reveals and exploits this weakness is a throwaway character we'd never met until the previous episode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">the stabbing doesn't even take, since Buck is revealed alive in his grave at the end of the episode</a>.

In one episode, he was prevented from doing so, and started physically falling apart as a result. This is not a problem for the others and is only a problem for him because of his lack of experience shapeshifting.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> has Data, an incredibly strong, fast, durable, and intelligent android...with an off switch on his side.

The Voyager crew, on the other hand, used scientific investigation and creativity, which allowed them to design a weapon to use against 8472. They are also unable to adapt to blades: Worf killed them plenty with those and they <em>never</em> adapted.
</li></ul></li><li> Although not one related to the villain itself, the Goa'uld of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> have force shields that can be bypassed by slower-moving objects. (Bullets won't work, but a thrown knife will). Later, the Replicators can only be destroyed with projectile weapons. Yes, their only weakness is <em>getting shot</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It makes sense in the show.</a> Specifically, energy weapons don't work on Replicators because the machines have energy shields resistance to all forms of harmful energy. However, projectile weapons like modern-era guns do their damage through <em>kinetic</em> energy, which causes the Replicators' relatively fragile bodies to shatter. Even this only slows them down, as the Replicators reassemble themselves from their component parts. Later a weapon is developed that disrupts the energy field animating the blocks, finally giving the heroes and effective way to kill Replicators.

The first varies from villain to villain but is usually elaborate or silly: shoot him with an arrow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">through the small target on their chest</a>, drop a house on her (a mobile home worked in a pinch), etc. The second is always "foil their evil plan"; they don't get do-overs. Either method makes them vaporize instantly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original Megazord had two big weaknesses. The first was that it was solar-powered. If it ended up deprived of said energy, it would lose power and shut down. The other was that it couldn't fight well underwater as it wasn't designed for traversing the ocean floor. Thankfully, Dragonzord is suited for such a thing.
</li><li> The Warzord Cyclopsis was one of the best things Rita ever deployed, because its computer could adapt to each Zord and Zord formation used, (configuring the shields, targeting, weapons, armor-plate angling and such). However, quickly switching formations enough would overtax this system, causing the computer to lock up due to being asked to do more tasks at once than it was capable of. This allowed the Rangers to beat its restored form, obliterating it permanently.
</li><li> Z-putties. In the first fight, the rangers stated they were invincible, until Jason discovered they explode when you hit the "Z" on their chest. Later, kids were able to destroy them launching balls at the "Z".
</li><li> Because he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, the Green Ranger was plenty powerful, but because of how he returned to action, he couldn't stay in battle too long or his powers would run out. Come the second season, most of Zedd's early plots were essentially "take out Tommy."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em> had the Chameliac Warrior who copied the Rangers' powers... that is, until they swapped their attack moves with their friend's moves: Pink used Blue's moves, Green used Yellow's moves... you get the idea.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">name</a> for this trope is the Greek hero Achilles. In Homer, he's not invulnerable (he bleeds from a minor spear wound). Classical Greek art depicts Achilles being killed by an arrow to the body. But Statius, writing in the 1st century AD (900-some years after Homer), gave him a colorful superpower. According to Statius's account, Achilles' mother, the nymph Thetis, dunked him in the River Styx to make him immortal. However, she wasn't able to dunk the foot she held him with, since as a goddess, she could not bear the touch of the Waters of Styx. Quite naturally, he was killed by a poisoned arrow to the heel, courtesy of Prince Paris of Troy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">For some reason she didn't think to dunk him, pull him out, dry him up, flip him over and dunk the dry foot</a> (according to the myth, Thetis had seven children, but only Achilles survived the dunk in Styx, presumably Thetis didn't want to risk dunking Achilles a second time). An alternate version has Thetis anointing Achilles with ambrosia and burning the mortality out of him over a fire. Her husband Peleus happened to walk in on her and, well, there's a reason the two are living separately by the time Achilles grows up.
</li><li> Also from Greek myth, the Gigantes were the children of Gaia and only had their supernatural powers when they were touching the ground. One of these, Antaeus, was defeated by the Olympian demigod hero Heracles, who did such deed by lifting the giant up with one hand and beating him with the other. Other stories say the true Gigantes could only be killed by weapons of a mortal being. Hence, the gods invited Heracles (or perhaps that was the entire point about their affairs with mortal women). Some Gigantes were defeated by gods, but not killed - one is still alive, breathing fire under Etna.
</li><li> Another weak-heeled one was Talos, a giant bronze man who guarded Crete from invaders and was defeated by losing the nail in his heel that acted as a plug for the one vein in his body and promptly bled out.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Persian epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShahnameh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShahnameh">The Shahnameh</a>,</em> the Persian prince Esfandyar bathed in a pool of invincibility, but kept his eyes closed as he submerged himself. When he picks a fight with the hero Rostam, he gets killed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">arrow through his eyeballs</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Biblical</a> Book of Judges, Samson loses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> when Delilah <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">cuts off his long hair</a>. Notice that this is hinted to <em>not</em> be a 100% Achilles Heel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> as he was, Samson had broken all of the other rules God gave him to keep his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and telling Delilah about his hair (and how he was consecrated to God) was figuratively the last straw. In a nutshell, the big three vows require Nazarites to abstain from alcohol, to not cut their hair, and to avoid corpses. Apparently Samson was known to have had wine in the past, touched (and consumed honey out of) a lion's corpse and there was that whole 'beat hundreds of Philistines to death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">with the jawbone of an ass</a>' bit, which doubtless left him around a number of dead bodies afterwards.
</li><li> When Baldr of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> started dreaming of his own death, his mother went around to every single thing in existence and made them swear an oath to never harm Baldr. Presto, invulnerable god, right? Not quite: she forgot to ask mistletoe, since it seemed too small and shriveled to be a threat. When the rest of the pantheon decided to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong">"Let's throw things at Baldr"</a> into their favorite party game, Loki (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealous</a> of the attention accorded Baldr) tricked the blind Höðr into shooting a Mistletoe arrow at Baldr...
</li><li> In the German poem, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em>, the hero Siegfried <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">bathes in the blood of a dragon</a> after he's slain it, and becomes invincible as a result. However, a leaf had stuck to his shoulder, and thus left a spot there untouched by the blood... and yes, the similarities between him and Achilles have been noted before.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RussianMythologyAndTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RussianMythologyAndTales">Russian mythology</a> features Koschey the Deathless, an elderly evil warlock who has his death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">stored separately from him</a>. His death is a needle hidden in an egg, that's inside a duck, that's inside a hare, that's inside a chest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">that hangs on a great oak, that grows on a distant island</a>. To kill Koschey, a hero must break the egg and/or the needle.
</li><li> The Tlingit people of the Pacific Northwest have a monster with an Achilles Heel: Once there was a giant that ate people. A man decided to kill the giant, so he played dead where the giant walked every day. The giant found him, brought him home and left to get firewood. The man jumped up, threatened the giant's son with a skinning knife to make him tell where his father's heart was. It was in.... The left heel! The giant returns, and the man stabs his heel. The giant screams, "I will eat your people forever!" But the man chops him into pieces and burns him. The ashes become mosquitoes, which form into a cloud and laugh, saying "I told you: I will eat your people forever!" Then the man looks on his arm, which has a mosquito on it...
</li><li> <em>The Folklore of Discworld</em> mentions one British town's story of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> dragon that had only one unarmored spot on its body, which was its anus.

<ul><li> Basketball player Shaquille O'Neil (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Shaq</a>), one of the best players in NBA history, had an infamously poor free throw percentage. The best way to keep Shaq from steamrolling you was to intentionally foul him, forcing him to shoot free throws that he'll probably miss. This tactic became known as "Hack-a-Shaq." Interestingly, Shaq was a consistently decent-to-good free throw shooter in practice throughout his career; something about the pressure of being put on the spot in a game situation always threw him for a loop.
</li><li> Lebron James, a seemly unstoppable force, was exposed as a poor mid-range shooter during the Finals of the 2006-07 season. He's since corrected this problem, however; as the Finals during the 2012-13 season would prove. And both against the same Finals opponent, the San Antonio Spurs.

As this was a major gripe about the two classes, eventually the developers responded by reducing the effects of the weapons to make it simply a danger rather than an overwhelmingly crippling threat. Furthermore, many defensive sets have Achilles Heels in the form of damage types they offer only minimum protection against. Ice Armor melts under fire damage, Fiery Aura is susceptible to cold, Dark Armor has only minor protection against energy and so on. Only two or three armors in the game offer appreciable protection against psychic attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>. Boss monsters are often vulnerable in the eye. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ganon/Ganondorf</a> usually has a spot on his chest or his weakness is his tail. The Master Sword is more or less kryptonite because the sacred sword has the power to repel evil.
<ul><li> Many enemies and bosses have a crippling weakness that is not immediately apparent, and requires use of an uncommon technique or one of Link's many, many secondary weapons. Knowing the method can easily reduce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> and even final bosses from hellish trials to mere annoyances. Often the boomerang is involved: it can stun most enemies, even those with an otherwise impenetrable defense, and in some games can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> even the strongest of enemies. A common alternative is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb">Feed It a Bomb</a>.
</li><li> In particular, there is Veran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>. Her specialty is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, and in such a state she is effectively invincible, because the heroes don't want to harm her host. However, hitting her with a mystery seed briefly breaks her possession spell, allowing her to be attacked directly. She tries to cover this by investigating mystery seeds early in the story (presumably to defend herself against them), though ironically this leads Link straight to the tree that produces them. Probably also doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>, though the seeds are at least somewhat rare.
</li><li> The titular character herself Zelda's particular weakness is prolonged attack or highly effecient attack as this is usually the way she gets into trouble that Link has to bail her out of. This is even reflected loosely in the <em>Smash</em> games where Zelda is lighter than any of the male characters (including the young boys) and is taken away by weight dependent items faster than them and also gets knocked out faster.
</li></ul></li><li> In the later editions of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series, bosses began to show certain specific weak points. For example, all of the Uroboros creatures in <em>RE5</em> have glowing weak points which can be shot to expose bulbous body parts that can then be targeted to kill the creature itself.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> gives two main ways of dealing with Krauser. Shoot him in the knee so he drops his shield, then shoot him in the head, over and over again. With indifferent aim it's easy to run out of ammo before Krauser is killed by gunshots. Or stab with the knife, normally a weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Emergency Weapon</a>, about 10 times.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robocraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robocraft">Robocraft</a></em>, no matter how good your robot is built, there are two main weak points : the blocs under your driver seat, and the driver seat itself. Lose either, and the bot immediately explodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarshipTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarshipTitanic">Starship Titanic</a></em>: "Please do not prod my Achilles buttocks." The line is delivered by the Maître d'Bot (in a hilarious French accent) when you poke him in the butt with the stick. You have to do this because it's the only way to get to the corpse holding a fuse you need to repair the ship.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>, all of the heroes can fit this trope for their respective final boss fights on the player's route towards the Good Ending. For example, King Gallon believes himself to be invincible, as only a person with Titanian royal blood and Odette's power over death can actually kill him. It happens to be Oswald.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> have "abilities" that can have this effect.
<ul><li> Shedinja is immune to 13 of the 18 attacking types, thanks to "Wonder Guard." However, it will always get knocked out quickly when hit by an attack of those 5 that can hit it because it has just one hit point at any level. Several forms of indirect damage will also defeat it, like switching in when the widely used Stealth Rock is up. Oddly, this leads to Shedinja being used in both the lowest and highest tiers in competitive battling. Those 5 types and Stealth Rock (especially in overused) are much more common in the middle and low tiers. However, in the lowest tier it actually has stats that don't completely suck compared to other Pokémon.
</li><li> Slaking has ridiculously high stats, so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> by its "Truant" ability, which only lets it attack every other turn. The nastiest thing a Slaking can face is an opponent with Protect—a move that completely neutralizes any incoming attack, but is only guaranteed to work if you don't use it two turns in a row. (Detect also works, but has less PP.) Slaking can't attack two turns in a row, so an enemy with Protect can simply alternate between that and any other move, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">chipping away at Slaking</a> or weakening its stats while it sits there helplessly.
</li><li> Regigigas is a Legendary with a very good stat spread and moveset, or at least it would be if not for its Slow Start ability, which halves its attack and speed for five turns, longer than its still-decent defenses can keep it alive in most cases.
</li><li> Then there are Pokemon that have double weakness against some elemental types, which means that basically any attack of that type will faint them. Rather unfortunate for those who have double weakness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">Stealth Rock</a>. This can also include, and frequently does, some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Mons</a> that aren't banned in battle facilities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. An example would be Dragonite, Salamence, Hydreigon, Nihilego ..
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostSoulsMUD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostSoulsMUD">Lost Souls MUD</a></em>, great power notoriously often comes with great vulnerability to holy damage.
</li><li> Every RPG ever with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change Boss</a>. Figuring out what the new Achilles Heel is in order to even make a dent in the boss (or avoid healing it) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">is the entire point of the battle</a>.
</li><li> While almost any of the monsters' body parts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> can be attacked and damaged, going for their weak points is the fastest way to finish them off. Of course, weak points vary from monster to monster, although it's usually the head, stomach or limbs. This becomes a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moment if you're unfamiliar with the monster you're fighting and unsure of where to hit them, although visual cues do exist to help players tell whether they've dealt a damaging blow, most frequently in the form of a lengthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitStop">Hit Stop</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">huge splashes of blood</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Little Mac</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a>... on the ground. If he's thrown or launched into the air even once, he becomes almost completely helpless.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IceClimber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IceClimber">Ice Climbers</a> perform at all times as a duo. Taking out the lead Climber respawns them both as it would any other fighter; taking out the partner Climber severely cripples the lead, as their recovery power no longer works effectively (unless you count "boosts you upwards by mere millimeters" as working) and their attacks lose a lot of utility as they expect to be performed by both Climbers in tandem.
</li><li> The beetle item can be this for lighter characters as it takes them faster than heavier ones thus giving the victim less time to escape. What is notable is many of the female characters who are damsels in their own games (Zelda, Peach, Palutena) are lighter in weight value than their respective male counterparts (Ganondorf, and all version of Link for Zelda, Mario Luigi and Bowser for Peach, and both pits for Palutena) and thus the aforementioned ladies who are kidnapped in their own franchise are fittingly taken away faster than the males of the same franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a></em>, but this trope is averted. In no way you can attack Achilles on the heel, and you can beat him by just beating the crap out of him on any body parts.
</li><li> The Reactor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VI</em> has a very simple Achilles Heel: it only takes damage from blasters. This is, in fact, blasters greatest advantage: their damage ignores any resistances or immunities possessed by enemies, and as the final dungeon not only features the Reactor you need to destroy, but also hordes of enemies with high resistances to every other sort of damage...
</li><li> Parodied somewhat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</a></em>. At one point you receive an item called the Achilles Heel which is used to defeat a minor boss in a timing minigame.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Narrator</strong>: Ever since the Achilles' heel was thrown at Benkei... <br/><strong>Narrator</strong>: Achilles' heel was meant to be the weak point of someone. <br/><strong>Ebisumaru</strong>: There's something fishy about that story...
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>: The whole point of the game is to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Giant Monsters</a> via this method, with the creatures often having more than one, being in really hard to reach places, or requiring a lesser weakness be exploited before the real one opens up. Finding the weak point is fairly straight forward. Staying on the thing long enough to damage it while it bucks about trying to throw you off it? Less so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Everlasting Dragons were completely invincible to any kind of attack... except for lightning. This weakness holds true throughout the series: anything draconic in nature will often have a weakness to electricity, and those who hunt dragons often wield electricity-imbued weapons.
</li><li> Anything related to the Abyss and the Dark will often be weak to Fire, seeing as Flame and Dark are opposites in <em>Dark Souls</em> cosmology.
</li><li> The Iron Golem has literal one. Attacking its heels repeatedly will make it lose balance, allowing for more attacks, and eventually fall on its ass, possibly even tumbling over the edge of the boss arena and istantly ending the fight.
</li><li> Spellcasting enemies are typically vulnerable to Vow of Silence and Profound Still, spells that have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> effect. This works on some otherwise quite difficult bosses, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">the Darklurker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Aldrich, Saint of the Deep</a>.
</li><li> King Vendrick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> is weak against the power of Giants, considering that they were his archenemies in life. Normally, he has so much defense that even the strongest attacks will barely even register, but every Soul of a Giant you carry cuts his defense in half. Players normally face him with no fewer than <em>five</em> Souls of Giants, resulting in a 32x defense reduction, and even then he can take a pounding.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>, Mythal the Baneful Queen is extremely vulnerable to pyromancy, especially if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">read ahead</a> and used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">Easy Level Trick</a> to drain her poison pool. If you haven't got your own pyromancy, store-bought is fine; there's a summon sign for Jester Thomas like ten feet from her boss fog.
</li><li> In the <em>Crown of the Sunken King</em> DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>, the Dragon's Sanctum area has a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan">spectral enemies</a> who can do a lot of damage to you while taking little to no punishment. However, if you can locate their bodies, which are immobile and wreathed in blood-red fire, and smash them (which only takes one hit), the spectres will be instantly rendered corporeal again and can be killed the old-fashioned way. This lasts between lives, too, so a viable strategy when you get to the area with equipment-damaging spikes all over the floor is to sprint through it until you find the room where most of their bodies are, dash through that room smashing each one in turn, and then go back and pick up your souls on your next life.
</li><li> Yhorm the Giant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> is fatally weak to a sword called Storm Ruler, which can generate giant magical wind blades that do extreme damage to him. Good thing too: fighting him normally, while possible, will take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">forever</a> due to his natural toughness and extremely large health pool. With Storm Ruler, he can be taken down in five or six hits.
</li><li> The entire point of the Ancient Wyvern fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> is to run the gauntlet of snake-men to get to a point above it, whereupon you can stave in its skull with one diving attack; however, with how it's programmed, you can get such an effect with a carefully timed jump from a raised platform at the start of its boss arena. This works with any melee attack, meaning that you can crush its skull <em>bare-handed</em>.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>, Slave Knight Gael is a nigh-unkillable juggernaut of leaping murder, but he does <em>not</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a> to poison, meaning that poisoning your sword, stabbing him a few times, and then running away until the poison wears off, is an entirely viable strategy - particularly since his boss arena is roughly the size of Wisconsin.
</li><li> Darkeater Midir, a DLC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> who is a dragon with a gigantic health pool, is surprisingly susceptible to the Pestilent Mist spell, which does damage based on a percentage of his health.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>, the Ka Po' Tun are a race of "tiger folk" native to the continent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Akavir</a>. They are said to be the most powerful empire in Akavir following a war with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Tsaesci</a>, but have an extreme weakness when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHateWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsHateWater">sea warfare</a>.
</li><li> The eponymous creatures in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series are fatally weak to cold, which is naturally exploited with Samus' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce">Ice Beam</a>. While this only holds true for the Metroid's Larval Stage, the later stages of their natural life cycle are only fought in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em>, its remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where an Omega Metroid serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a></span>.
</li><li> The Rebel Flagship from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em> is a seemingly invincible warship with four layers of shields, a stealth system that complements its already decent engines, a powerful hacking system that can ruin your day if it latches to your level 1 oxygen system, a medbay to surprise any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty">Boarding Party</a> as well as four powerful weapons, each running on their own system... each also disconnected from the rest of the ship (or two of them on hard difficulty), so two people party can beam in there, curb-stomp their operators, trash the weapons and leave the flagship with less offensive and no crew capable of repairing them.
</li><li> The security systems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSwindle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSwindle">The Swindle</a></em> become a lot less useful when the security stations are hacked: cameras shut down, doors open and drones deactivate.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Blood-Starved Beast is accurately named; a thrown pungent blood cocktail will distract it. It's also highly aggressive, and thus highly parryable.
</li><li> In the early stages of the fight, Father Gascoigne can be temporarily paralysed by a music box, which prompts his human side to struggle against his madness. It only works twice, though; the third time will instantly send him into the final phase, no matter how much health he has.
</li><li> Martyr Logarius performs a little ritual when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>. You can interrupt this, however, making him parryable in the final stage.
</li><li> The Kidnappers also do a power-up ritual when they turn red, leaving them wide open to a backstab.
</li><li> Cramped Caskets are very strong and faster than they look, but if you lure them into a glowing yellow pool, they <em>catch fire</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HackNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HackNet">Hack Net</a></em> has an unconventional example. EnTech, the corporation being investigated in the last act, has made almost all the machines impervious to hacking. True to the tropes, there's only one chink in the armor: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their Inviolability software can't handle medical services connections properly, and so isn't installed on the workstation of an employee with a networked implant of some sort.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiceyDungeons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiceyDungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some enemies are vulnerable to elemental damage, usually in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weakness</a> way: plant-based enemies like Rose and Wicker Man are flammable, as are ice enemies like Snowman, while enemies who are purely fire-based are susceptible to ice, and Stereohead's systems tend to do badly with electrical damage.
</li><li> Enemies who only roll a few dice are vulnerable to all sorts of status effects: Shock can shut down their offence, Freeze can limit the amount of damage they can do, and so on. Fireman is particularly weak to Freeze, for example, over and above his taking double damage from ice; all his attacks require even numbers, so every die turned into a 1 by Freeze is a die he doesn't have much use for. Enough freeze can even wreck the day of high-level enemies like the Rat King, whose endlessly recycling dice become a lot less deadly when it takes all his dice to even start the chain, leaving him one bad roll away from failing, or the Kraken, who has only one attack that doesn't require an even result.
</li><li> The Thief is very vulnerable to <em>high</em> rolls in the early game, particularly if he has a Dagger and Lockpick as his starting gear: a double-6 that ends up with one split into a 1 and a 5 is going to hurt.
</li><li> Crowbar/Wrecking Ball builds can do a lot of damage very quickly by counting down timers very efficiently, but they're very susceptible to Curse, which can shut down the Crowbar or Wrecking Ball while costing you a die - absolutely destroying that efficiency for a turn and leaving you with some quite large numbers you can no longer swiftly count down.
</li><li> The Jester needs matched cards for his discard and Snap power. If he can't get a match, he can't dig further into the deck for the cards he really needs and has to use them one at a time.

<ul><li> In the Season 4 Finale, Lord Tirek can directly steal a pony's magic entirely, in turn stripping them of their cutie mark and strength. He can even do this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods">Physical Gods</a> like Discord if he's powerful enough.

</li><li> In the Season 5 premiere Starlight Glimmer, an otherwise normal unicorn who isn't as strong or threatening as Tirek, reversed the equation and happened to learn a spell that <em>removes cutie marks</em>, once again stripping the pony of their strength and talent. She was able to use it to defeat the entire Mane 6 including <em>Princess</em> Twilight Sparkle single-handedly as well as render the entire group completely helpless <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">physically, anyway</a>).

When Buster tricks Montana Max's Acme Bunny Basher robot, it is about to drop Monty out of the top of his mansion. Buster decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">save Monty</a> by pulling a Durasmell battery out of its heel, which is labelled as the Achilles Heel. This powers the robot down. The robot drops Monty anyway, but Buster saves Monty from a nasty fall with a very expensive call to the Acme Rescue Center, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">which he charged to Monty's account</a>.

They only have one weakness: Josee's extreme claustrophobia which slows them down several times.
</li><li> Aku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> was spawned from a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> before time began. This creature was weak to divine magic, and the weakness carried over to Aku. Jack's sword was forged under supervision of the gods that destroyed the monster that Aku spawned from, and said sword is the only human weapon capable of hurting him. In episode 12 he's shown having extreme difficulty in defeating a water Goddess, and the golems spawned by her had successfully kept him away for some time. Even normal magic seems to do more against him than most anything else, as the Scotsman's Celtic magic from his sword <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his ghost form</span> are capable of warding him and his attacks off.

While it puts up a good fight, it has two glaring weaknesses: firstly, the spell was cast prior to the Shack being upgraded, and as a result, its protection does not extend to its legs. Secondly, the spell does not protect the Shack from regular physical damage. Once Bill realises this, he's able to exploit both weaknesses in quick succession, ripping off one of the Shack's legs and using it as a club to bypass the spell. He even mentions the trope name while doing so, as seen in the page quote.</span>

<ul><li> Being one of the most famous examples ever, Achilles' heel had a body part named for it, namely, the Achilles Tendon. Sever it, and you won't be walking again for a long, long time. Tendons in general are strong but have very little blood supply and heal very slowly. They also get stronger in response to exercise very slowly compared to the muscles they connect to. As such, a common and serious source injury of people who have taken up a new sport and don't know their limits is to have their muscle strength in the required muscles become sufficient to injure the weaker tendons they connect to.
</li><li> Not to mention joints, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eyes</a>, pressure points, the throat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">the groin</a> and the spine, especially near the base of the head are all weak points that martial artists take advantage of to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">one shot</a> their opponents, it doesn't matter how strong you are if someone hits you in the joy zone.
</li><li> There's a fraction-of-a-second interval of the human heart's contraction cycle during which a sudden impact to the sternum can disrupt the electrical signals of the natural pacemaker. Ventricular fibrillation sets in, and is usually fatal without immediate medical intervention. Called "commotio cordis", it's most commonly seen in athletic accidents with boys or youths whose sternal tissue hasn't entirely finished hardening from cartilage to bone.
</li><li> While most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> products<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5c8dh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5c8dh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5c8dh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a></span> are literally capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">taking a head-on tactical airstrike and still functioning perfectly</a>, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">DS</a> line features an Achilles' Heel in the form of the hinges, which are not only destructible, but quite vulnerable and can in fact eventually break from overuse.
</li><li> The cobra is a badass deadly snake from India with only one weakness. It strikes opponents rather slowly. Thus, the agile mongoose is able to defeat the cobra by jumping out of the way when it strikes and leaping up to bite the head when the snake is drawing back from the strike. Believe it or not, the cobra often manages to bite the mongoose <em>once</em>, but since the mongoose has a partial immunity to the snake's venom it takes more than one bite to kill one, and the cobra usually tires out after it manages to bite once. In any given confrontation between an Indian Cobra and an Indian Grey Mongoose, the mongoose tends to prevail three out of five times.
<ul><li> Mongooses in turn have an Achilles Heel when it comes to the kinds of snakes they can kill. Cobras are fast-moving snakes, but they have slow and predictable strikes, which is their Achilles Heel. In contrast, vipers are sluggish, slow-moving snakes with wickedly fast and unpredictable strikes. That's why, in a fight against a viper, the mongoose loses 95% of the time. Additionally, mongooses have another Achilles Heel in that they are only resistant to the venom of cobras and their close relatives. This leaves them susceptible to the venom of other poisonous snakes that they share their range with, such as the black mamba. There was once an attempt made to reduce populations of <em>fer de lance</em> vipers on an island by introducing a population of mongooses. It was a disaster. The mongooses were all defeated by the snakes and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">domestic cats</a></em> were used instead.
<ul><li> They also have issues with large nonvenomus snakes like pythons. Their size means that they can easily shrug off the mongoose's attacks and, like vipers, have a very fast strike with teeth designed to hook into the flesh of their prey. Since pythons rely on constriction rather than venom, the mongoose is simply squeezed to death once in the snake's grasp.
</li></ul></li><li> Venomous snakes as a whole share one, being grabbed directly behind the head. Typically when handling snakes most people will think to grab the tail as it's the part furthest from the fangs but it can still easily turn around to bite you, but if you grab behind it's head then it won't be able to bite and since venomous snakes aren't very strong, all they can do is wriggle helplessly.
</li></ul></li><li> Crocodiles and alligators have an Achilles Heel in their jaws. While the muscles they use to bite are very strong, the opposing muscles used to open their jaws are much, much weaker. A decent elastic band can turn a crocodile from deadly prehistoric monster to walking handbag. The same is true on a less impressive scale with crabs and lobsters.
</li><li> Sharks have a similar weakness: if you manage to flip one upside down, it will enter a state of "tonic immobility" and become paralyzed. Some orcas managed to figure this out to hunt sharks, as long as the sharks are small enough to be flipped over. Many sharks also must constantly swim forward to bring more water into their gills. If they're unable to do so for any reason, they'll drown.
<ul><li> Orcas in turn must breathe air, giving gill-breathing prey time to escape. They do cover it up by having one whale attack while the other breathes.
</li></ul></li><li> For many types of vehicles in combat (aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles included), traditional weak points include the fuel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">flammable</a>), ammunition (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">explosive</a>), and crew (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Squishy</a>).
<ul><li> A major weakness for Japanese warplanes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was their lack of self-sealing fuel tanks or armor for the pilots, meaning it was rather easy for an enemy pilot in a better-protected aircraft to set a plane ablaze or perforate the cockpit. It only made things worse for the Japanese that American and British fighter planes tended to be significantly faster and more heavily armed than theirs were.
</li><li> For warships, the biggest weakpoint has always been the magazines, where their stockpiles of ammunition are kept. Even sailing ships in the days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a> were known to occasionally explode violently. Throughout the 20th century, warship armor design has evolved to the point where if any part of the ship is armored at all, it will be the magazine, at the expense of any other part of the ship, due to the sheer destructive force of that much ammunition going off due to a fire or an unlucky hit. Another modern method of protection is to put the ammunition (typically missiles) <em>outside</em> the ship, in armored containers which both make it difficult to damage the munitions and also help to direct any "cook-offs" away from the ship (and the rest of the ammo).
</li><li> Destroying a ship's rudders is also a viable tactic, since the ship loses its means to maneuver. A famous example would be the German Battleship, Bismarck, which took a torpedo to the rudder, jamming it locking the ship in port side turn. Unable to repair the damage, the ship was left a sitting duck for the pursing British forces, who quickly pounced on it with everything they had.
</li><li> Japanese surface vessels up to cruiser-class had a weakness that was also their greatest strength: their torpedoes. While the Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo had superior range, speed, and payload to anything the Allies could field, it's liquid oxygen fuel was highly explosive and rather touchy. There are several accounts of Japanese cruisers being crippled or sunk by near miss bomb or shell attacks that set off one of the torpedoes while it was still in the launcher, causing a chain reaction that would break the ship in half.
</li></ul></li><li> In medical term, Achilles Heel has two meanings:
<ul><li> Achilles Tendon, the vulnerable joint parts.
</li><li> Achilles Heel can also refer to the specific gene which causes cancerous cell division, and some chemicals can potentially target to eliminate the tumor and cancerous cells.
</li></ul></li><li> Among cars, the 2003-2008 Toyota Corolla range (particularly the '04, '07, and '08) is legendary for its extreme reliability, longevity, and general ease and affordability of maintenance, save for one key caveat: its rocker panels rust out extremely easily, necessitating a substantial sum in body work. This is due to a design flaw that creates a crypt in the front of the rear wheel wells where the rockers meet, which allows slush laden with road salt to accumulate, rot through the metal, and collect in the inside of the panels and rot those out as well. It is because of this that anyone seeking to purchase a used Corolla from this year range should check the rockers to see if they are free of rust or have been replaced, or if someone sanded off surface rust and painted it without treating the rot itself.
