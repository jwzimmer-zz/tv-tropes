But also, I am YOU.')</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> Truth doesn't exist as it does in the manga. However, Edward's agnostic theism still pops up. Edward has several lines noting that, despite saying he's an atheist, he <em>does</em> believe in a God... He just has absolutely no interest in worshipping it and believes it's personally out to get him.

Even though he has seen them himself and felt the effects they have, he argues that, since all of his experience is filtered through human (read: fallible) senses, ghosts do not exist in the scientific meaning.

</li><li> In the original game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hanyuu</span> tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keiichi</span> that the human will is greater than any god or fate. Noticing a theme yet? Not an uncommon one in Buddhist countries, as one of the basic tenets of Buddhism, is that human beings are best suited to achieving Nirvana, which is beyond all deities, while the gods themselves are too caught up with being supremely wise and powerful to look beyond their state.

<ul><li> In his first battle against his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> Oceanus, Camus goes so far as to say humanity has the right to oppose gods that have no respect for humanity and view them as playthings.

Her killing him, bringing him back to life, etc. has nothing to do with the issue. She eventually gets sneaky in her pursuit of his belief. And sadistic. Mostly sadistic. He verges somewhat into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> territory because his debate is literally over her existence - he does not, in fact, accept it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although he does swing in this direction in later arcs. At least enough to accept that Beatrice has enough of existence to have motives</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And he switches sides when he winds up as Endless Sorcerer</span>.
</li><li> Rakushun, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em>, just doesn't see much point in praying to the gods:
<div class="indent">"Well then, who do normal people worship? Anyone?
</div><div class="indent">"Not me. Why, if you work the fields well, and the weather holds, you'll get a bountiful harvest. No Emperor is going to change that, and it's the climate that'll say whether you weather is good or bad. You can cry and you can laugh all you want, but when the rain falls, it falls, and when it don't, it don't. Praying won't help anything."
</div><ul><li> Which is ironic since a bad ruler in that world (they're appointed by divine mandate) <em>will</em> blight crops and ruin the climate. No ruler is even worse. Prayer still makes no difference though, with the exception of procreation, which is handled through prayer to a tree instead of doing the deed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/YoujoSenki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/YoujoSenki">Youjo Senki</a></em> gives us an extreme example in Tanya Degurechaff: in her previous life as a salaryman, she seriously dissed God when He talked to her in the moments before her death, refusing to address Him as anything other than "Being X". This pisses God off enough that, in her new life as a magical soldier in an alternate version of WWI-era Germany, she is forced to pray to Him to keep her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> magical gem from killing her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">BNA: Brand New Animal</a></em>: The beastmen worship the Silver Wolf, a protective deity, and make small offerings of wrapped meat to pay for his help. Shirou doesn't deny the Silver Wolf's existence, but insists that any god that demands payment for protection is not worth worshiping. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He in fact is the Silver Wolf himself, foreshadowed by him eating the offering in apparent disdain for the tradition</span>.

Practically every superhero has fought some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">demonic invasion</a>, without being particularly bothered by the theological implications of it as far as the reader gets to see. Teaming up with Thor, Hercules and Wonder Woman has rarely if ever influenced heroes' beliefs, even if they get to visit Asgard or Thymescria and learn that, yes, there really is something supernatural to them.
</li><li> Eppy Thatcher, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grendel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grendel">Grendel</a></em>, actually has "God hates me" as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulCornell">Paul Cornell</a>'s take on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Luthor</strong>: In a cosmos like ours — if you accept the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">Big Hand theory</a>" of the universe's origin — deciding on atheism isn't a <em>logical</em> choice.

Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">all he's been through</a>, it's easy to see why.
<ul><li> Given that Bill is exactly Thor's equal in power after being given his own Asgardian hammer, accepting that Thor is a god would require thinking of himself as one. He doesn't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">that kind of ego</a>, even though it would be arguably justified.

He has this attitude because he's sentenced to go to Hell due to his suicide attempt as a kid. Since then he has battled demons and the like to try to "butt his way into heaven" but was told repeatedly it doesn't work that way. He's not permanently barred - an angel (well, half-angel, but whatever) points out that all any human needs to do to be forgiven of their sins is to repent. The fact that John refuses to do so, since he believes suicide was a perfectly rational reaction to his "gift," is actually a great example of this trope.

</li><li> Borderline example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>, Loki's first appearance has him convincing a nun that her service to some "father figure saying 'Don't do it, or I'll spank you!'" is misguided and there isn't really any proof of God. The trick is, Loki's a fallen angel, who's not only stood in the presence of the Almighty but has spoken to Him personally. He just acts like an atheist because he loves to "fuck with the clergy, man; I love keepin' them on their toes."
<ul><li> Also Bethany, who by now has seen the Metatron and thus is pretty sure God exists:

However, it's not a deity that requires faith or love, only obedience.
<ul><li> Jame is also fascinated by the native gods of Rathillien, the Kencyrath's current temporary home, and carries out experiments on them.

It helps that Crom more or less encourages this with a definite <em>laissez-faire</em> policy towards his worshipers: Cimmerians are expected to take what they want from life using the gifts given to them by Crom at birth. As far as Crom is concerned, creating the Cimmerian race was gift enough, and calling on his assistance every time they are in need would be contemptibly weak. Crom only takes pride in them if they never call on him for aid in their lives.
<ul><li> Though that doesn't mean he's <em>completely</em> absent from those of his followers. He once saves Conan from a dishonorable death from a sorcerer (the implications being so Conan could have a more glorious death down the line, befitting him.) Conan is pretty aware of this and privately offers Crom a sacrifice as thanks.

It's also worth noting that the setting doesn't really have a Supreme Being, instead the Disc was made by a sub-contractor who hurried off as soon as construction was done, life evolved from bacteria on a sandwich Rincewind left behind at Creation, and the gods we see have fairly limited powers and tend to become less active as their number of worshipers grows.

And Harry has tangled with lower-case-g gods multiple times, in one case even having a polite conversation with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hades</span>.

Merlin may be a native Everworld example.
<ul><li> Jalil is the best example of the series. For the first several books, the group goes with whichever gods they're dealing with at the moment, mostly as a function of practicality and not dying. However, when the opportunity first arises, Jalil tells the gods (specifically, the African gods) that he is <strong>NOT</strong> going to kowtow to every deity that they happen to come across, and quite persistently tells them to buzz off.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> says that all professed atheists are really this because they can see creation around them and figure it out for themselves.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans">Romans 1:18-25</a>:
<div class="indent">18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <br/>19 For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them. <br/>20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. <br/>21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <br/>22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <br/>23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. <br/>24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <br/>25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen."
</div></li><li> Note that the last line goes as far as to claim that anyone who doesn't worship any gods (or anything that isn't the Abrahamic deity, since it supposes that everyone inherently knows that other gods are fake) must be worshiping something else by default, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">be it themselves</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">a material element </a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">or pure pleasure</a>. Some real-life theists actually believe this is necessarily the case for atheists, even though these three ways of living just mentioned are not a vital pillar for lack of religious belief by itself, nor a necessary consequence of it. Others have argued this does not refer to atheism, which at the time was less well known, but rather impiety or the disbelief in the Abrahamic God alone.

</li></ul></li><li> Deism is the belief that God exists, created the universe, and then left it to its own devices. This was quite a common belief between the Enlightenment (and the decline in religious sentiment in Western societies) and Darwin's theory of evolution (which provided a naturalistic explanation of the origin of life). Most deists as a result didn't actively "worship" in the sense of praying or performing rituals. However, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">wasn't due</a> to a negative attitude about God, but since they didn't believe it was useful.

In their case however they didn't believe that the gods created the universe, and had even evolved from mortal beings, combining this view with a strictly materialist cosmology.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChroniclesOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChroniclesOfDarkness">Chronicles of Darkness</a></em>: Very common, since being a supernatural being gives a person a certain perspective that induces natural skepticism towards the existence and/or worthiness of human-worshipped gods. Exactly how tends to vary depending on the supernatural race in question.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampires</a> are the least likely splat to give this. They're clearly supernatural, yes, but compared to some other races, they're surprisingly ignorant of the world around them. Although their lack of certain traditional "holy" weaknesses, like being repelled by crosses or unable to enter churches, does give some pause, many aren't sure. As a result, one of the five Covenants who give vampires some organization in the night are the Lanceae et Sanctum, a Christian Covenant that preaches vampires have a place in the scheme of things as "God's chosen monsters", with the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a>.

Actual religious figures, particularly of the Abrahamic faiths, don't show up at all, though spirits deliberately trying to found cults and manipulate mortals do. At the same time, spirits can give potent magical boons to those who help them, and worshiping them is one of the easiest ways to do so. So, not only is there a tiny minority of werewolves who manage to cling to their pre-Change beliefs, but there's also a minority of werewolves who actively worship their totemic spirits, although they're not supposed to. The Pure are more of an aversion; they genuinely do worship and reverse the spirits, which is one of the reasons why the spirits like them more than the Forsaken.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mages</a> are a mixed bag. Some do give up on their old beliefs after their Awakening, especially those who have the ability to communicate with the dead or the spirits. Others retain their old faiths.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Prometheans</a> generally don't think much about religion, being too concerned with their ongoing Pilgrimage to try and forge souls for themselves. Many do form a sincere belief for their chosen faith if they choose to explore it, but others still tend to drift away again when they realise it's not going to magically finish their quest for them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changelings</a> are well aware that there are creatures out there that might as well be divine... of course, as these same creatures abducted and tormented them, transforming them into half-human freaks, they generally aren't inclined to worship them, and often become skeptical of human religions as well. There are those who don't feel that way, especially if they become convinced that their Durance was God's punishment for sinning or some such thing, but they tend to be a minority.

Dying and coming back from the dead tends to breed respect for the idea that there are more things out there than humans are generally aware of.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse">Mummies</a> know for a fact that the Judges of Duat are real — they can hear them screaming in their souls when the Arisen thinks about disobeying, and they only exist because the Judges created them in the first place. So the vast majority of the Arisen do worship and homage the Judges. On the other hand, they tend to be scornful towards human religions, save for how they can utilize and exploit them; after all, Mummies were created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">centuries before the Abrahamic faiths existed</a>, and many of the Arisen can remember <em>being there</em> for the founding of Islam and doing battle against Judaic heroes during the time period the Old Testament calls the Book of Judges.

Thus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> feature clerics of Kossuth, the Elemental Lord of Fire who doesn't care that he doubles as a deity, or in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a> setting you can simply be a cleric of Fire itself. There are even classes that bypass the gods entirely: the Archivist from <em>Heroes of Horror</em> is an occult scholar who can cast divine spells from prayerbooks like a more conventional wizard learns spells from tomes. Ur-Priests, on the other hand, despise deities and use their abilities (usually granted to them by demons) to steal divine power from the gods as they work to destroy them. It goes without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">saying that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">gods don't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">like them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">very much</a>.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> setting hasn't really answered the question if gods actually exist or not, and many of the religions don't center around gods. The Blood of Vol believe that the gods cursed mortals with death, while the Silver Flame is based around the remains of a paladin's sacrifice, the Elven religions are ancestor worship in one form or another, and the Path of Light is a philosophical religion. The followers of the Becoming God <em>know for a fact</em> that their god does not exist, because they're <em>building</em> him. The spells of their clerics work just fine anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> has Mystics and Primal Sorcerers that arose during the early Fifth Age. Mystics draw their power from the energy of all living things on Krynn and their own soul, and Sorcerers draw their power from all non-living matter on Krynn. A large part of the flavor for Mystics is that because they draw power from a strong faith in themselves, they can not worship a deity because worshiping a deity is drawing power from outside of themselves. Sorcerers technically can choose to follow a deity, but many do not because they arose during a time when there were no deities.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> it's a pretty bad idea to not worship anything since you will be condemned to the Wall of the Faithless after death. The sheer number trapped in the Wall shows that this doesn't stop people from denying the gods worship.
<ul><li> One notable nay-theist in this setting is Artemis Entreri, whose mother was raped by a priest of Selune while his neighbors in the Slums of Memnon were exploited by the rest of that Order. He knows the gods exist, but he sees them as powerful beings who pretend to be good or lawful while being petty monsters no better than anyone else. Though it should be noted that this backstory contradicts the canon that <em>Forgotten Realms</em> deities do not tolerate deviant behavior, and any priest of a good deity who commits an evil deed will have his powers stripped from him until he atones. It was implied in <em>Road of the Patriarch</em> that in Entreri's case, the worship of Selune had been usurped by an evil deity posing as Selune, possibly Ibrandul or Shar masquerading as Ibrandul.
</li><li> Much like Artemis Entreri, many of the ancient Netherese believed that gods were simply very powerful beings, and any sufficiently powerful creature could effectively become one. When Karsus, one of the most powerful wizards in Netheril, put this theory to the test by stealing the power of the god of Magic itself, he accidentally destroyed almost the entire empire by dropping their flying cities out of the sky.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> setting, most of the Athar faction don't deny the existence of gods and other Powers, they just think beings like Zeus or Odin are merely powerful planar beings - hence their motto, "The gods are frauds." They are open to the idea of a non-personified "Great Unknown," however. Their former leader, Factol Terrance, was a cleric of the goddess Mishakal (from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting) who simply woke up one day and realized he was no longer awed by his deity's power; he knew for a fact that she existed, but no longer believed she was genuinely divine. The Athar are based around the giant pillar supporting Sigil, the City of Doors, at the very center of the Concordant Plane of the Outlands (said to be the hub around which the multiverse revolves), a place of such strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> that even deities' powers are nullified. A perfect place to philosophize and experiment without being disturbed by irate gods, in other words.
<ul><li> Similarly, the Believers of the Source (or "Godsmen" as they're more popularly called) believe that gods are simply the beings that have reached the apex of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Karmic Wheel</a> — godhood is their "payoff" after having reincarnated enough and lived "good" lives throughout. Thus, while the Godsmen won't deny gods exist, and many of them worship gods as an ideal and as a way to respect those who have reached the apex of existence, every one of them aspire to the same height and don't believe gods are anything intrinsically special (this bears a close resemblance to the beliefs of many Buddhists).
</li><li> Half-giants (from an open content sourcebook) believe in the gods, but generally, don't consider them important.

Since the gods are currently under siege by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">lunar gods</a>, they haven't been helping to correct this, because they can only intermittently spare power for their clerics and paladins, and their most powerful and devout worshipers rarely get to take advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> because they really need as many righteous dead as possible to help them fight the lunar gods.

If there is a god and you're an Exalt of any type, it's your job to kick it in the nuts until it behaves. The Sidereals live in the capitol of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">Celestial Bureaucracy</a> and it's their job to regulate millions of celestial gods, most of which are as much powerful as they are complete jackasses. The Immaculate Faith is a tool of the Sidereals to make sure the terrestrial gods don't see humans as mere essence batteries, and its tenets forbid full-blown worship of gods. So yes, gods exist; you can chat with one, you can have sex with one (or several), but they can't expect you to respect them.

<ul><li> Although not without its share of problems — plagues, pirates, famine, giant beetles, and an ever-expanding desert for starters — that believers are quick to attribute to divine wrath, Rahadoum actually copes quite well, and in fact boasts a centuries-long history of peace and stability that other, more religious nations can't match. It is however fairly dogmatic in its atheism, viewing religious people and divine casters as essentially part of a hostile power, and tends to be fairly hostile to them — notably, the two iconic characters from Rahadoum are both exiles who cannot go back home for this reason, as one developed faith during her travels and the other was forced to leave the country after spontaneously manifesting oracular powers in her youth.
</li><li> In Touvette, though officially a military dictatorship, it's implied that most see General Cabol Voran's rule as being genuinely better than the religious wars that previously devastated the country.

At the same time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">the sheer number of people who believe in the God-Emperor of Mankind has more or less elevated him to deity status</a>, or at least to an equal level with the Dark Gods.
<ul><li> The kicker is that the Emperor <em>knew</em> this, but prior to ending up on the Golden Throne, he pushed a rational, secular Imperial Truth that was dismissive of religion and gods and demons, as part of his attempt to starve the Chaos Gods of faith. So in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> novels we have a scene where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">pre-heel</a> Horus has to sit down and have a talk with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> who just saw a creature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possess someone</a>, mutate his body horribly, drive three people insane, and kill a half-dozen genetically-engineered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">super soldiers</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">power armor</a>. How does he explain it? That the "demons" and "gods" of the Warp are just creatures that live in another aspect of reality. The "magic" they use is simply following a different set of the laws of physics, channeled by psykers. Indeed, these very real and "natural" beings are what probably inspired those ancient myths, so why not call them daemons? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Problem is, that doesn't mean there's no reason to fear or worship them...</a>.
<ul><li> This varies quite a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. In one version, the Emperor actually is a living god who has been around since the early stone age (created by humanity's shaman sacrificing themselves to create him when they noticed their previously reincarnating souls were now being eaten by the Chaos gods).
</li></ul></li><li> The Tau qualify as well. They've done battle with the forces of Chaos, including daemons, but the Tau's lack of psychic power and their miniscule Warp presence mean that they view such foes as exceptionally unpleasant aliens. This leads to a funny moment in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> games where a Chaos Marine is trying to psychically taunt the Tau commander, who merely complains about his malfunctioning comm unit and tells his men to quit screwing around.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">C'tan</a> fall here as well. Worshipped as gods by the Necrontyr (before they became the Necron), and with power to match any of the "real" gods, but certainly denied as such by those who actually know of their existence. In a twist, the Machine God, generally agreed to be an alternative aspect of the Emperor in order to prevent humanity descending into civil war yet again, is sometimes implied to be a hibernating C'tan.
<ul><li> In another twist, it's also hinted that the C'tan known as The Deceiver and the Chaos god Tzeentch may also be one and the same.
</li><li> As of the more recent Codices, the C'tan are "merely" incredibly powerful but ultimately physical entities who have no connection to the Warp. The Machine God is indeed a C'tan: the Void Dragon, whom the Emperor beat into submission and sealed away on Mars to act as an inspiration for the Adeptus Mechanicus. Mephet'ran the Deceiver is not Tzeentch or the Eldar Laughing God Cegorach, though the three apparently know and respect each other for being devious bastards.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eldar and Ork gods tend to fit as well. Any manifestations or influence on their part is generally dismissed by others races as demons, illusions, or just good old psychic powers.

Magicians like Marisa Kirisame have little use for religion save for its magical applications, and tend to be more committed to their craft than to deities - Marisa once complained about how the faithless can't understand faith, and when she outright asked Kanako what faith was, she was told "It's exactly the same as how you feel towards magic."

Their very name makes reference to the fact that the Holy Light they worshiped while alive turned its back on them. One of the <em>Warcraft</em> novels notes that it was not uncommon among the Forsaken to dress as priests of the Light and "mock the order by wearing their garments and allowing the sacred robes to be soiled and tainted by their bloody work."
<ul><li> actually, the Light has not abandoned them. The Light is also not a sentient being or anything resembling a stereotypical deity (although it does seem to have an agenda). It is however a very very powerful universal force, which can be tapped into by belief in one's cause and willingness to sacrifice for it. Forsaken, just like anyone else, can in fact use the Light. However, doing so hurts them (and canonically, sets them on fire). This is because they are animated by magic that is opposed to the Light, shadow magic. This does not stop some Forsaken, or indeed some Scourge: but it does make the prospect unattractive to the majority of Forsaken or otherwise undead priests. A large number of the races in the game do not worship the Light as such, but their use of the Light is often a biproduct of their worship of something else (the ancestors for the Tauren, or the animal-god loa for the trolls). Other races, such as the Pandaren, also tap into the Light without worshipping anything in the conventional sense (they seem to have a non-theistic philosophy akin to Taoism). The dwarves don't worship the Titans exactly, but do respect them as their creators. Since the Titans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">kind of assholes</a> this is a very sensible outlook. Their ability to use the Light comes rather from their commitment to their leaders and culture.
