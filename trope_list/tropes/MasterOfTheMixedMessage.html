</div></div><p>Alice is in love with Bob. It's very obvious. The writers make no effort to hide the fact. However, we aren't sure how Bob feels about Alice. Every once in a while, he'll do something incredibly romantic, and then turn it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a> or something similar. He may flirt with her often, but make it seem like it's playful and doesn't mean anything. Often he'll ask her out on a date, and after she accepts reveal it's a group affair, even though the conversation beforehand hinted it might be intimate one on one time.

Is he gay? She just can't tell. Every single statement he makes can be interpreted both ways, so when he gets done, Alice is left asking "Well, how am I supposed to interpret that?"
</p><p>Alice can count her blessings, though. Nine times out of ten, when it's actually revealed how he feels, it will turn out that he did like her all along. Maybe he had the same doubts she did. Maybe he never thought of her that way, but once he did, realized it was true. Or sometimes he was sending mixed messages because he was genuinely confused.

<ul><li> Kyoko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em>, and pretty much every other member of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">main couple</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a>'s works. Except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Lum</a>, of course.
<ul><li> It gets worse in Takahashi's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma Â½</a></em> series where this trope is beaten into the ground by every single member of the main teen cast towards each other in virtually every single combination possible. And a few of the adult cast too.
</li></ul></li><li> Saiki appears to be this way from Teruhashi's perspective in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisastrousLifeOfSaikiK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisastrousLifeOfSaikiK">The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</a></em>. From the audiences point of view Saiki is clearly uninterested in Teruhashi. He knows from reading her mind with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> that she loves him, but since she hasn't told him Saiki can't reject her without outing himself as a psycic. The only plan Saiki can think of to get her to leave him alone is to act as undesirable as possible. This might work, but whenever he tries this something comes up that makes him look interested in her, and his previous behaviour in some way excusable making him an enigma to her which just makes her more attracted to him.
</li><li> To a lesser extent Gourry towards Lina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>. Romance isn't played up all that much, but in the few times Gourry seems like he might be interested in Lina, something always happens to make us unsure again (it was usually some kind of spell or misunderstanding).
<ul><li> In the anime, the problem is usually that, while Gourry seems to be kind of affectionate, it's never clear whether or not he's intelligent enough to understand what volunteering to be Lina's "Protector for Life" implies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<ul><li> England is implied to be in love with America, but it isn't clear if America is simply oblivious and just being his usual tactless self towards him, is aware of England's feelings but only likes to lead him on before shooting him down, or does like England back but has the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">personality problems</a> as he. One set of translated notes suggests that America is tactless on purpose, so it must be one of the latter two. Though given one time when he seemed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">actually manage to hurt England's feelings (by saying that the reason he looks forward to his own birthday is because he remembers how pathetic England's face looked when he was beaten)</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasJustJoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasJustJoking">he claims he was joking</a>.
</li><li> Probably Italy, as shown in Buon San Valentino. He doesn't realize that in Germany, red roses mean a confession. therefore, Germany is rather confused as to whether Italy was just showing a friendly gesture, or if he was, in fact, confessing to be in love with Germany. This is still up for debate.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer">Overman King Gainer</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Gainer Sanga</a> makes no secret of his crush on his schoolmate Sara Kodama, but for pretty much half the series, it is not known if Sara feels the same towards him. Even when it does become clear that Sara reciprocates (she did get pretty jealous when Gainer was going to meet CynthiaÂ…), she seems not to know what to do about it, and ends up sending her friend contradictory signs. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, though, it all ends well with Gainer and Sara heavily implied to have hooked up.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SasamekiKoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SasamekiKoto">Sasameki Koto</a></em>, Ushio gives poor Sumika major headaches with this kind of behavior, although she tends to be more on the cute rather than the aloof side.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em>, Akira is more and more behaving this way toward Fumi, but in this case it's more an indication of Akira's confusion about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having Fumi, a girl, confess to her</span>.
</li><li> Kunimasa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LovePistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LovePistols">Love Pistols</a></em> his first interactions with Noririn range from rape to help and want to marry him, not surprisingly, Noririn spends a good portion of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc">Character Arc</a> wondering what exactly is their relationship and what are Kunimasa's feelings for him. Most of this seem to be fixed after their summer trip and Kunimasa's brother falls for Noririn, making Kunimasa realize that Noririn is completely capable and up to going for someone better to him and leave the relationship. Most recently on the manga, Kunimasa proposes that they get married once Noririn graduates and states clearly his feelings of love.
</li><li> Kyousuke of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em> light novels toward his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">childhood friend</a> Manami, who has a crush on him. He calls her plain and unremarkable, yet says that this is his favorite thing about her since the familiarity is comforting. He keeps saying how much he appreciates her, and enjoys his study sessions with her. He also tells her that every time he's with her it's like his soul is healed of his troubles. One time he offered to take her someplace special, she accepts and they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotADate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotADate">Not a Date</a> at the park. There she hints at him to kiss her, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">misses the cue</a> to her disappointment. He even wants to go to the same university as her to make their comfortable relationship last as long as possible. Yet, in all those instances, he always mentions (to himself and others) that he's definitely not in love with her.
<ul><li> His friend Kouhei even calls him out on this in one episode of the anime. Kyousuke describes his non-romantic interest in her as living with an old grandmother who then suddenly became a teenager again. Yet Kouhei asks if Kyousuke would get jealous if another guy pursued her, and he says he wouldn't approve of that. Kouhei sums it up as "Kyousuke won't pursue Manami romantically, but at the same time won't allow another guy to pursue her." Kyousuke answers "yes" to that with a straight face, which only further confuses his friend.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoraNoManimani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoraNoManimani">Sora No Manimani</a></em> Mihoshi loves SakuÂ… but it's unclear if she loves him as a childhood friend or something else.
</li><li> Holo is this to Lawrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em>. The main problem is that Holo is a <em>massive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTease">Tease</a> who engages in ungodly amounts of flirting (and is intimately comfortable with Lawrence physically) even though she knows their journey has to end and thinks a long-term relationship would only end in heartbreak. Furthermore, she intermittently a) coaches Lawrence about relationships and to act in a manner that she considers romantic, and b) manipulates him with those same behaviors to make fun of him and get things she wants. Throughout all this, she still has enough moments of honesty that they grow just about as close as possible without actually becoming a "couple". It's a weird example of the trope, as she's not really being coy about the fact that she likes him, she just likes messing with his head until he has no idea how to react. And as the series progresses, he figures out how to get the better of her and starts treating her the exact same way.
</li><li> Miroku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha">Inuyasha</a></em>. One moment he's doing sweet things for Sango, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">groping her</a> or telling her how she owns his heart, and the next he's trying to bed every single pretty girl that cross his path. He continues this sort of behavior right up through the episode "Miroku's Most Dangerous Confession," at the end of which he quite seriously tells Sango that he thinks of her as a comrade in arms rather than as a womanÂ… and then asks her to marry him and have his children.
</li><li> The entire first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ItazuraNaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ItazuraNaKiss">Itazura Na Kiss</a></em> has the male lead Naoki being first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceKing">extremely cold</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">unexpectedly gentle</a>, and switch again to being cold and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">rude</a>, much to the poor Kotoko's confusion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It takes a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">Green-Eyed Epiphany</a> to finally show his true feelings.</span>
</li><li> Tomoe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss">Kamisama Kiss</a></em> is a regular condescending asshole to Nanami most of the time. However, he does occasionally show a sweet and caring side to her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">should another man so much as look at her he flips his lid</a>. But every time Nanami asks if he likes her or loves her, Tomoe is quick to deny it or invent some excuse for his actions.
</li><li> Hayate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>; the only person in the world who can make a kidnapping ploy sound like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>.

The songs send an ambiguous message with a few songs with the word "friend" in the title, many love songs and a couple that imply he thinks she's fat. Finally, after she decides that the tape is a romantic gesture, he reveals that he's making one for the rest of the apartment. He invites her out with a bunch of his friends that night, and she asks "Like a date?" He says "Sure," as if the idea had never occurred to him.
</li><li> Hamlet to Ophelia. Just how much depends on the interpretation (if Hamlet is not actually insane, then his behavior towards her is much more this trope). Early in the play, Ophelia tells Polonius how Hamlet has lately "made many tenders of his affection" to her. Act II, scene i has Ophelia describing how the disheveled Hamlet comes to her for comfort (just after speaking with the Ghost, though she doesn't know that). In Act III, Scene i, he tells her "I did love you once" and then immediately tells her that he never loved her. In many productions, this scene is made into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> by having Hamlet passionately kiss Ophelia at some point, usually just before he begins verbally abusing her, which he famously finishes off by telling her she'd be better off as a nun (or a whore, depending on how you want to take the word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetTheeToANunnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetTheeToANunnery">"nunnery"</a>).

If he chooses to lie and deny it, he then asks Kyousuke who he likes, and he responds, "Right now, Riki is my number one," failing to clarify what he means by that.

</li><li> The <em>Shall We Date?</em> games are romance games, so this trope is inevitable, but Emperor Kuze in <em>Heian Love</em> takes it to a whole new level. He sends the player character an anonymous love poem... which he later tells her he sent as a joke, not because he's in love with her... and then gets his feelings hurt when she doesn't want him to stay and talk to her. Later he makes a practice of showing up at her rooms to talk all night, but tells her she has no sexual appeal at all. Needless to say, all of this leaves the poor girl quite confused for a while.

As a result, she constantly reminds herself that he doesn't think of her as more than a lyricist and has herself so thoroughly conditioned not to get her hopes up that even when he calls her "the woman I love" right in front of her, she can't quite believe it.

Ash very obviously likes Emily, but Emily can't seem to make up her mind. Complicating the issue is the fact that Emily is (supposedly) straight, and Ash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">used to be a guy</a>. Later on, however, Emily gave in and tried to kiss Ash... but Ash reluctantly walked away; s/he doesn't want to be "too happy", afraid of giving up on getting back his/her old life.
<ul><li> Ash has a problem with this when it comes to male friends. Ash tends to do things that make boys mistakenly believe he's interested in them, when Ash's intention was only to be friendly. Examples include suggesting going to a movie (just the two of them), and treating another to lunch as a "thank you". This is mostly due to the fact that Ash staunchly refuses to see himself as a girl, so he doesn't seem to consider how his actions appear when coming from a girl.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: Both of the protagonists are guilty of this, which serves primarily to fuel the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">facepalm-inducing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle">Two-Person Love Square</a> they're stuck in.
<ul><li> Adrien is the more obvious of the two - many of his interactions with Marinette push into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> territory, to the point where even <em>other characters</em> notice it, but whenever he's called on it, Adrien insists that Marinette is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">just a friend</a>". In his defense, a lot of it comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature">Plagg</a>, meaning he can probably be excused for writing a lot of it off as just the kwami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a> him as usual. Ironically, he runs into the opposite problem as Chat Noir - while he is serious about his affection for Ladybug, he expresses it in such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">over-the-top manner</a> that she thinks he's just joking.
</li><li> Marinette isn't quite as bad as Adrien in this regard, but she (as Ladybug) occasionally returns Chat Noir's over-the-top flirting, under the impression that he's not being serious, leading Chat to suspect she was just toying with him. The fact that she starts calling him "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">kitty</a>" after finding out (as Marinette) that Chat <em>is</em> serious does not help her case. She gets worse (as Marinette) in the third season, repeatedly denying any interest in Adrien and having their friends do the same, which, combined with the fact that Adrien has basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">his upbringing</a>, is a recipe for disaster, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and probably played a role in pushing him toward Kagami in "Heart Hunter".</span> In the New York special, Alya even points out (in response to Nino lampshading Adrien's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">insane obliviousness</a>) that Marinette isn't sending clear signals.

<ul><li> These are the tactics the "Seduction Community" recommends to men that want to be more successful with women, the logic goes as this: If you are a man and you are open about your feelings, the woman will take you for granted and lose interest in you, on the other hand, if you "play" by sending mixed signals (like flirting once and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingHardToGet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingHardToGet">Playing Hard to Get</a>) the woman will be constantly wondering about your true feelings and intentions (ergo: thinking about you, and being intrigued) which will "open" her to be more receptive to you. It's known as the "Cat String Theory"; named after a cat's tendency to chase after string that's difficult to get, but lose interest the moment they've got it for sure.
</li><li> <em>The Rules</em> suggests women adopt these obnoxious behaviors too. This will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">surely</a> end well..
