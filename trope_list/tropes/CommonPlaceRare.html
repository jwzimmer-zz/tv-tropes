<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> In many games in the series, glass bottles are <em>extremely</em> valuable to Link; he usually can only find about four of them in each game and it requires searching the farthest, most remote places in Hyrule. Yet there's frequently a thriving milk industry, and potion sellers can't only be selling to people who have traveled past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">The Lost Woods</a> to get the one glass bottle that Farmer Brown is only willing to give to someone who completes his mini-game. You don't need (usually explicitly magical) glass bottles to drink potions or milk, except you do because the game won't let you use anything else. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em>, the rarity of glass bottles (one NPC equates being allowed to keep one as adequate reward for <em>saving his sister's life</em>) is actually justified this time around. Glass is made from sand, sand is crushed rocks, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Floating Continent</a> everybody lives on has an alarmingly finite amount of habitable land as it is. Breaking any up to smelt glass (which can easily fall from the island or shatter into uselessness) would have very permanent consequences. On the other hand, it's playfully lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">A Link Between Worlds</a></em>. The vendor selling a bottle for a high price is noted by a nearby shopkeeper to be a charlatan, and one character gives you a bottle after he's done using it with the expectation that you'll throw it away.
</li><li> Getting an "adult's wallet" that carries more Rupees seems to always require fantastic feats and gifts from supernatural creatures. This despite Link's apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> inventory. It's the same with larger quivers and bomb bags, too, although in the case of the bomb bag, several games state that they're crafted by Gorons and made of odd or rare materials like Dodongo stomachs and/or the woven fibers of bomb flowers.
</li><li> While the only bow in the land is always locked in a dungeon, shops still sell arrows and enemies with bows still exist. There's even a market catering to people with bows, in the form of shooting mini-games. This one is partially justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, where it's heavily implied that the Hero's Bow is unique and magical. Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em>, where you can actually purchase the bow for an exorbitant 980 rupees (or steal it).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, a sidequest involves a ghost on the toilet asking for "any kind of paper". Despite there being a lot of books and paper pieces in the classroom, as well as several rather pointless paper notices you can read on the wall, the only piece of paper you're allowed to give is the love letter a classmate asked you to give to a girl. And no, after the girl shoots the letter down you're not getting it back.
</li><li> A similarly-appearing character in need of paper appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>. And you can give him a love letter too, except the love letter here should actually be used to start another sidequest. As an alternative, a Title Deed can be given as well, but it too has another intended purpose. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> solves the dilemma.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> has the rubber armor set, which reduces damage from electricity and can make you completely immune to it if upgraded. In this case, the rarity of rubber is justified by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">no one knows how to make it anymore</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, you must repeatedly visit the Temple of the Ocean King, a cursed place filled with evil phantoms and multiple puzzles that drains the life of anyone who enters it, in order to acquire... maps that allow you to sail from one island to another. Something you'd expect to be far more common in a ship-filled seafaring world like this one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em> has one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> example - the longsword. A simple weapon, probably obsolete at the time you pick it up. What takes this from oddity to hair-tearingly frustrating is that while these were as common as you'd expect in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> games, there's only one here, it's necessary for a sidequest (and with only 5 available at a time, you want to complete these), you won't know this until some time later, and <em>there's nothing stopping you from selling it</em>.
</li><li> An interesting case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em>. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> CG cartoon, the Crystal Coconut was a rare and powerful artifact that the bad guys were trying to steal. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, it's not all that hard to acquire a large number of them, as you use them to access special abilities.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion">Maniac Mansion</a></em> and its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a></em>, nothing physically prevents you from leaving the Edison Mansion, which causes some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> when considering the ludicrous lengths you have to go through to get commonplace objects such as an envelope and stamps (in the first game) or a bottle of vinegar (in the second). Possibly justified in that both games are set at night, and the mansion is in the middle of nowhere, possibly hours away from the nearest shop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry1InTheLandOfTheLoungeLizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry1InTheLandOfTheLoungeLizards">Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards</a></em>: You need a rope to tie yourself to a railing in order to get some pills. It turns out you can't just buy that rope but have to shower a sleazy girl in a disco with lots of gifts, pick her up, marry her, order some wine to your suite, let her tie you to the bed, and after she's robbed you blind and vanished for good, you can cut the rope with a pocket knife you received elsewhere for another bottle of wine.
</li><li> Granted, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePerilsOfAkumos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePerilsOfAkumos">The Perils of Akumos</a></em> takes place on a space station, but you still go to odd lengths to find a used coffee cup.
</li><li> The entire Interactive Fiction game <em>Curses!</em> is about the main character trying to get a Tourist Map of Paris. It turns out to require breaking an ancient family curse and time traveling several times to obtain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVAbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVAbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder">King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!</a></em>, you need an old boot to throw at a cat so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">its prey will give you vital assistance later on</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">Â Â Â Â First Person ShooterÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There is only one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>â€”and that's to get a gun shop owner a six-pack of cola. (Oddly enough, the corner store where the cola is located has <em>only</em> the cola in itâ€”all the shelves are bare.) This is also the goal of the "Hard Rain" campaignâ€”fight your way through zombie hordes, a sugar mill full of witches and a hurricane to get gas for the boat. Justified in that the closest gas station had already been emptied by people fleeing by car.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em>, one mission requires you to go to a diamond mine to steal some dynamite, which you're told you'll need to destroy a water pump. The only practical way of getting the dynamite is killing all of the mercenaries guarding the mine, and there are at least a <em>dozen</em> of them, meaning that this little fetch task inevitably turns into a full blown firefight. This all seems very pointless, since you have RPGs, hand grenades, improvised explosive devices and M79 grenade launchers available at this point, and any one of those should have had no trouble with the fragile-looking pump. It's even worse when it comes to ammo upgrades. When you can only carry 90 total assault rifle bullets, a 67% increase to 150 sounds pretty good. In real life, you could achieve this exact thing with a double-mag pouch, which you can find at a tactical store or online for about $15. In game, you must pay 15 golf ball-sized DIAMONDS. Damn, how much for just a fanny pack?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>: The (in)famous hats, which are the most demanded and valuable items in the whole game despite not having practical use besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">looking cool</a>. How rare are they? With the current item-drop system, there's a minuscule chance (1 in 128, possibly even lower) that you might get one after 15 mins. to 2 hrs of play, but most of time you'll get a random weapon. <strong>However</strong>, there's a weekly cap for dropped items, (roughly 7 - 12 per week) after which you'll not get new items until next week. You can also use the crafting system in order to get one, but it takes from 54 (to craft a random one) to 75 weapons (to get a class-specific one) in order to do so, which translates into several months worth of game-play.

For comparison, it's like not being able to use television remotes unless they were made by Panasonic, and are powered by Rayovac non-rechargeable AA's.

</li><li> Another inexplicably uncommon item: shirts. T-shirts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HawaiianShirtedTourist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HawaiianShirtedTourist">Hawaiian shirts</a> have no armor value in and of themselves, but can be enchanted to give a valuable extra few points of protection. <em>If</em> you can find one.

Playing a slot machine until it explodes will rarely give you a dollar, and there's no other way to get one. Sometimes you can sacrifice some of your permanent health to a demon altar for a quarter. However, the most expensive items are in the realm of 15 <em>cents</em>, so if you do get that dollar, it'll probably last the entire game.
</li><li> The world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal">Maj'Eyal</a> is apparently chock-full of artificers, master craftsmen, etc, seeing as mundane items are quite a bit rarer than items with special powers. Normally, you wouldn't <em>want</em> a plain item anyway, as the "egoed" items are strictly better, except that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">gems</a> can be taken to master jewelers to imbue mundane rings with special powers (one artifact, the Lifebinding Emerald, is totally useless without a voratun ring to set it in, unless you're playing one of the two classes in the game that can use it directly), and a pair of artifacts can transform plain weapons and armor into powerful "crystalline" versions of themselves. Especially painful for dagger users: The Crystalline Voratun Dagger is one of only three top-tier artifact daggers in the game, but the "regular" voratun dagger you need to make it is harder to find than most artifacts.

That's some wallet. They're also extremely rare if you waste the few you get as a part of the story.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>: in <em>Throne of Bhaal</em>, powerful magic items are everywhere, while non magic common items are never used as basically useless. Except in the lair of Yaga-Shura, where there are some enemies that can be hurt only by non magic weapons, and the games places such items hidden in the dungeon for this purpose among other valuable loot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzlePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzlePirates">Puzzle Pirates</a></em>: Black clothing is very valuable, as black dye can only be obtained by pilfering kraken's blood, a rare resource, from strong merchant ships. Nope, you can't kill a kraken yourself, much less mix different colors of dye together. This actually makes sense, considering that no matter what proportion you mix different colors dye together, you'll only ever get a really dark shade of brown, not black. The only way to get black dye... is by mixing a black pigment with a solvent.
</li><li> An even worse example involving dyes is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, where dye of ALL colors are only obtainable as entirely random world drops. There's a "dye merchant" but he only carries what other players have sold to him and his prices depend on supply and demand. Naturally, this means more popular dyes are much more expensive, and of course the most expensive here is also black. The best part is that dye doesn't actually <strong>do</strong> anything other than change the color of <strong>one</strong> of your pieces of armor. This is in no way surprising however, as top-quality gear is very easy to obtain, and the only things of any particular value for experienced players is gear that looks particularly nice.
</li><li> Ancient proto-MMO <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheRealm">The Realm</a></em> had similar dye issues for some of its early versions.

</li><li> A mid-level quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> requires the player to travel halfway around the world, loot an ancient pyramid, and rescue a shopkeeper's daughter so that said shopkeeper will bestow upon you <em>some ground black pepper.</em> But considering that historically spices were occasionally worth more than gold by weight... it makes a certain amount of sense that someone with the resources of a king might trade something that isn't irreplaceable (a ship) for something that, in that part of the world, was practically one of a kind.

Early on, you'll run across a sidequest to help make medicine out of the famous cure-all water of Angel Falls. The man who makes the medicine requires "fresh water" to make this medicine... which you won't be finding for several hours, five towns later. Turns out, by "fresh water", he means the alchemy ingredient you can find in predetermined spots on the world map. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">According to the item's description</a>, the "fresh water" is "wondrous" and of "perfect purity", but when you're asked for "fresh water", you don't expect that to turn out to be a mid-level alchemical treasure, do you?

Why you can't just ask the king for a ship remains unexplained.

<ul><li> Many kinds of fruits suitable for cooking and cocktailcrafting can be bought from NPCs for 70 meat, but others like cherries, limes, and jumbo olives can only be found as loot on monsters, so they go for roughly 1000 meat at player-run stores. Bananas are limited-edition fruits that sell for around 40,000 meat per bunch. However, this is nothing compared to beets, which were discontinued so long ago and dropped so infrequently that they can't be bought for less than 180,000,000 meat, despite being completely useless <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1a1ce');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1a1ce" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1a1ce');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Its description says "...a beet cannot be beaten.

</li><li> Pickling supplies (dill, brine, vinegar, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ghost</span> cucumbers) are quite rare, as the area where they drop only appears for a single day at a time,usually on April 1st. The factory has only appeared 10 times since June of 2004. Holiday monsters also create some common-rares; Thanksgiving foods (tofurkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce) can only be acquired once every 3 months, and each player only gets to collect a few of them.
</li><li> The Tiny Plastic Sword is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. It's used to make quality drinks with relatively little investment. They are sold at the mall for 75,000,000 meat, largely for the same reasons used wrapping paper is expensive.
</li><li> For reference on what these prices are to people who don't know the relative value of money in Kingdom of Loathing, the Mr. Accessory item (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Which players recieve for each $10 they donate</a>), sells for ~30,000,000 as of this edit (The price fluctuates depending on what goodies you can exchange them for). That's right, tiny plastic swords are worth a little bit more than $20, and beets are worth over $60.
</li><li> There is also Hell Ramen, a food whose joke is that Ramen is so cheap, you gain money by eating it. Except it is very good food, giving nice amounts of substats and adventures for a basic pasta, so it goes for a few thousand meat in the mall.
</li><li> Used wrapping paper (which can be crafted into equally-rare weaponry or used to make gifts with nothing in them) costs 395 million meatâ€”that is, over $130 of real-life money, or many months of meat farming. It was only available from gifts in a Christmas giveaway back in 2003 (more common gifts from later on don't produce the paper item when opened), only a few were generated because there weren't many players at the time, and most of them have been lost over the years due to account deletion.
</li><li> Present bows aren't quite as a severe example as used wrapping paper since they cost 5 million meat (as of the time of this writing), but they're still fairly rare since they can only be obtained from small Christmas presents from Christmas 2004 or from winning some of the Penguin Mafia raffles held during early 2008.
</li><li> Delicious Salad was only available from the "Spectral Salad Factory," a meta-joke zone that appeared on April Fool's Day in 2008 and vanished forever the next day. Other types of salad are common, but only the Delicious ones can give you the collectible salad tattoo, so it was an overvalued item for a long time. This finally ended in 2015 when the "Deck of Every Card" included a means of generating salads.

There are also discontinued holiday healing items that are rather valuable, such as pumpkins, Easter eggs, and the most valuable item in the game - Christmas crackers. Half-full wine jugs are also ludicrously expensive (originally, you drank half of a jug of wine at a time, but they later changed it so your character chugged the whole thing).
</li><li> The quest "One Small Favour" will take at least four hours of dedicated running around the map doing errands for a huge number of people for an incredibly unique item: A keyring. A small band of steel, bars of which most players have sitting in their banks, which even the universe's greatest blacksmiths cannot replicate.
</li><li> While doing "One Small Favour", you learn to craft an item that you cannot learn to make otherwise, despite the item itself being needed for two other quests ("Swan Song" and "Back To My Roots"), thus making One Small Favour a prerequisite for those quests. The item in question? <em>A clay pot lid for those clay pots that you've been making since Level 1 Crafting</em>.

<ul><li> After leveling your character up to level 45 or higher, you and a group of 4 other like-minded adventurers (you'll die if you try to do it alone) can go on a dangerous quest deep inside Zul'Farrak to obtain the electric scale of a giant hydra named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>. To simply summon this hydra, at least one of your group must go to another continent, then battle his way through hordes of troll cultists to obtain a sacred mallet, then battle his way through even MORE hordes of trolls to bless this mallet at a very special altar. AND all those trolls used to be elite, that is extremely powerful for their level (thankfully, they changed that in a later patch). Your ultimate reward? <strong>A carrot on a stick.</strong> In the game it actually was rare and highly sought-after for a while because it was one of very few ways to make a mount go faster, but the mundaneness of the item itself made the whole quest chain absurd. The absurdity was only compounded by the item being usable with <em>any</em> mount, include carnivores.
</li><li> There are a lot of items you can buy from vendors that are incredibly expensive while serving no actual purpose whatsoever. Unless you happen to need, say, a wedding ring for roleplaying.
</li><li> Some kinds of pets are incredibly rare to acquire. Rats, for example. Some others can only be bought from vendors of one faction, so they will be fairly expensive for players of the other faction wanting to buy them over the neutral auction house.

You get to keep the artifact, and are also rewarded with a unique item: The shaman's weapon which is like the one every single shaman owns. Its only power is to give your attacks a lightning damage bonus, which makes it no different from an ordinary lightning orb.

Made more obvious by the fact that prices are based on their value in yen, yet in-game currency is dollars, leading to a $3480 frying pan and a $98 cup of noodles.
</li><li> A similar thing happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em>, even the most trivial items (snacks, slot machines, etc.) cost almost $100.

</li><li> Introduced in the same game: Charcoal. While this game allows you to buy an endless number of them, future games (and even the remakes) don't and give you a single piece of Charcoal per game.
</li><li> Fishing Rods, which are only available by finding three specific expert fishermen on your journey; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Black 2 and White 2</a></em>, you don't get <em>any</em> rod until post-game.

Subsequently, they are very rare items that you can only find through sending your PokÃ©mon on cave expeditions for treasure or trading shards (previously established to be parts of the items that power up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Arceus</a>) for them or, very rarely, by fishing them up. No, you can't get them by simply buying drinks, that would make too much sense.
</li><li> The Pokemon Audino in the fifth generation â€” it can be tough to find if you don't know to look for any shaking grass (where it has the highest percentage of showing up).
</li><li> Certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> are, ironically, like this. Especially ones that were easy to find in the wild in one generation, but aren't in the next. Your best bet might be to find it on the Global Trade Station, but this can be compounded by several factors: If the evolved form isn't used much in competitive battling, this means that most people won't go out of their way to breed for them, meaning that people aren't likely to put any extras on the Global Trade Station. Due to people thinking that no one would want this creature, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon">Com Mon</a> in question actually becomes difficult to acquire.
</li><li> Berries are easy to find in Hoenn, Sinnoh and Alola. In every other region, they are only given by a select number of NPCs and they often only give you the most common ones.
</li><li> Feebas when it was introduced in the Hoenn games. It is an ugly fish with stats and movepool that puts it firmly on par with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Magikarp</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">with a very powerful evolution to match</a> but still, very underwhelming on its own). <em>Unlike</em> Magikarp, which can be found pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">everywhere where there's fresh water</a>, Feebas is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">ludicrously hard to find</a>. Only one trainer (who's off the main road) has one in the whole games, so it's likely you'll play through the whole main storyline without even knowing it exists. And the way to get it is not only convoluted and never even hinted at in-game, but unique to the series (it cannot be found by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">wandering around</a> like most other Pokemon, you <em>have</em> to find a handful of specific floor tiles where it shows up). And the worst part? If you actually manage to catch one, its Pokedex flavor text specifically mentions that it is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">common and frequently ignored by trainers</a></em>, both invoking this trope and inadvertently mocking the person that just spent hours trying to catch it. Eventually, this was fixed in later generations, with Feebas just being somewhat uncommon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LandsOfLore">Lands of Lore</a> 2</em>: The silverleaf is supposed to grow in the Dracoid Cemetery. Except that it doesn't. Instead, you have to find glass orbs, charge them at three different machines (One of which is located in a completely different and <strong>HUGE</strong> level, the Dracoid Ruins) to open the various crypts. (The orbs can be charged with white, blue or yellow sparks to open crypts with corresponding doors. If you you don't have the right kind of orbs, you may have to go all the way back to the right machine.) In one of those crypts you will find the ghost of a dracoid priest who wants you to cremate his body for him and bring him the ashes. And where might his body be? In the farthest corner of the Ruins. So after this incredible endeavor, he opens the door into the dracoid king's crypt for you. (This is back at the Cemetery, mind you.) What does <em>his</em> ghost want? To destroy what's left of the Ruins of course! So he gives you his bones in an urn that you have to take to a statue somewhere in the ruins, which will come to life and fight an ice worm, causing the ruins to flood. So you have to get the hell out of there, end up back in the jungle, head back toward the Cemetery... and <em>then</em> the king will make the silverleaves grow. To top it off, whole piles of silverleaves turn up later at the Ruloi Citadel.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondDivinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondDivinity">Beyond Divinity</a></em>, a dying prisoner asks for a drink of water. You have to go back almost to the start to get the only bottle of water on the level. This takes you through a guard station, mess hall and kitchen area but none of the dozens of cups and bottles contain any water or can be filled from the numerous barrels and sinks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore">Secret of Evermore</a></em> has the alchemy system. Oh, sure it makes some sense to have trouble gathering things like Oil, or Wax, but... water? It's not even like it has to be purified water, you can literally scoop it from a river in the middle of a swamp. But only in certain spots that are sniffed out by your dog.

It turns out to be <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_sclarea">clary sage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a fairly common, hardy and widely-distributed medicinal plant. Still, everyone reacts as if it was incredibly rare. On the other hand, you're explicitly not on Earth in this sceneâ€”you're on the planet Expel, where Clary Sage very well might be a rarity. If you want to go the extra mile, however, you can go further into the cave and find the Dill Whip. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">doesn't bring you any reward whatsoever</a>, but at least you get told that your characters have found a legitimately undiscovered plant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> has jerky, which appears twice in the game. The first time it is used is as a minor plot advancement point. The second time it is part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> for getting some optional equipment in one of the zany <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">sidequests</a>. About 2 minutes into the game you can find the shopkeeper selling it, for 9900 gold. A trifling price when you will need it (much later in the game), but at the beginning it seems insanely overpriced. Bizarrely, you can also resell the Jerky for 10,000 gold to the person you're supposed to give it to. However, to advance the plot, you have to give them the Jerky for free.
</li><li> Backpacks are some of the rarest, most expensive goods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>'s Ferelden.

A backpack in the starting town of Gorhart has a base price of 7500 gold, more than nearly any magical weapon available at the time.

Later in the game, an NPC gives you the task to obtain mandrake. For some reason, only mandrake from one specific location qualifies, all the other mandrake doesn't work; and you can't get to that spot yet (semi-justified in that he wants <em>fresh</em> mandrake, and the stuff you can buy is presumably dried: it doesn't make a difference a spell reagent, though). Going back further in the series, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em> mandrake and nightshade cannot be bought, and can only be harvested in one place each in the entire world, during one particular lunar phase.
</li><li> Guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate">Resonance of Fate</a></em> are like this. One can only wonder where all the hordes of bandits in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> get their guns from, when only <em>two handguns</em> are for sale <em>in the entire game</em>, both at exorbitant prices. And yes, that means two individual guns, not two types of guns. Naturally, the hordes of bandits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment">never drop their weapons when they die</a> either. One NPC implies bandit guns tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns">cheap, mass-produced pieces of crap</a>. Professional mercenaries like the player characters are better served with their expensive, reliable firearms than risking a knockoff exploding in their hand. But then most of the dozens of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories">expansion parts</a> you end up attaching to said weapons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">crafted</a> from random junk dropped by enemies anyway.

For example, you'd think you could get human flesh and human hearts from every enemy you kill, but they're some of the rarest ingredients in the game, and are never looted from human enemies.
<ul><li> Giants toes are a great example. You would think you could get ten from every giant you kill, you are lucky if you get one.
</li><li> Only two samples of Spiced Beef can be found in the game; this item cannot be crafted using the cooking mechanic despite both beef and spices being commonplace.

For example, you won't even be able to acquire any variety of wood until after you've beaten Chaos - which involves defeating ten characters' personal stories, plus four additional stages of battle (all of which have five substages). Even then, one slab of regular lumber is apparently more common than a splinter (and explicitly costs less to trade for).
</li><li> The ultimate forging item for Onion Knight's ultimate weapon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, requiring five Megalixers (which themselves are excessively difficult to get)? An onion. Thematically appropriate, but it's still an onion.

Some of the spells have very broadly defined ingredientsâ€”"combustible substances", "metal items", "anything edible"â€”and finding these is as easy as you'd expect in the real world (in both the studio and the "haunted house" set, most of rooms allow you to pick up tons of items; e.g. the kitchen allows you to ransack the cupboards and drawers and put every single tiny can, pot and piece of cutlery into your inventory).

You'd think things like bread and cookies would be common, you tend to find them in unceremonious places like jars and ovens in people's homes, and nothing seems to imply these are rare or special variants of commonplace things, but there's only 10 of each of these across <em>both games</em>.

Most games have <em>one</em> set of them hidden somewhere, and that's it. For comparison, in the first game, this makes a set of Boots as rare as a staff that can bring someone who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a> back to life.
</li><li> Any MMO with a crafting system can run into this when it comes to certain materials needed for crafting being found only from high-level gathering or drops from high-level enemies, despite being quite ordinary in real life. Or conversely, some materials might be fairly easy to find but require a high level crafting skill to actually be useful.
<ul><li> Similarly, in older MMOs where the majority of the population is max level and doesn't alt much, low level crafted and/or dropped gear that makes use of all common materials can be difficult to come by for new players. As the old population sees no reason to craft/sell it.
</li><li> Special holiday events can push extremely common and normally unsought after materials to high prices as lazy players find it easier to buy them rather than loot them, resulting in massive price gouging. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> christmas events generally involve giving milk and cookies to santa. Cookies can be crafted by anyone with level 1 cooking skill, but require bird eggs, which can drop from just about any level 1 avian enemy. Bird eggs move from being unsellable on the AH to stupidly expensive as soon as santa arrives.

The only other ways to get more pails of snow are from two specific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta">Mr Sacks</a> cards that can each only be played once or from the Urchins for an exorbitant cost of 7 Storm-Threnodies and 1 Night-Whisper. Granted, the collected snow is definitely not your garden-variety snow (dipping a soul in it causes it to <em>explode</em>, for one thing) and is essential to get lodgings and items that canÂ’t be obtained anywhere else, but it doesn't change the oddity of homeless children selling buckets of a substance that you <em>should</em> be able to easily scoop up from the ground at a price that even players with maxed-out stats and gear will struggle to pay regularly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em>, fishing rods are <em>extremely</em> rare, but are nigh-useless as weapons. They can only drop if you have a specific unique tricorne equipped. Another equally rare item is the bait: albino rhoa feathers can only drop from the equally elusive albino rhoa. It is said that these are the items required for fishing, but few players actually <em>know</em> how to fish, as the staff will relentlessly hunt down anyone who discloses fishing secrets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has a lot of gear that are only used for glamour purpose and are fashioned after seemingly common items like sleeveless shirts, winter coats, swimwear, etc. However, the materials needed to craft said gear are difficult to find, thus it's quite common to see players sell the crafted gear for a lot of gil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has this on occasion, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in that most of the items you find are ruined.

Made worse by it being the only type of bullet that you can't craft <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">because it's a rimfire cartridge.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> has several items that are necessary for crafting.

Once the player sets up a couple of farms and starts making vegetable starch, aluminum will be fairly rare. And after fully upgrading the weapons and power armor, building up the numerous settlements will certainly cut into the supply of gears, copper and oil, and only the last one is craftable (and still requires bones, which can mostly be found by raiding super mutant encampments).

<ul><li> In the online virtual pet game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em>, the rarest items initially were... food. The only place food was generated was at the food stores every five minutes. Unfortunately, they ran out in 15 seconds or so. You could feed your pets at the soup kitchen if you were poor enough, which led to lots of people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a> just so they wouldn't have to spend all their money on an apple.

The problem has since been negated by the addition of more places and ways to obtain food, including the General Store, which unlike every other shop <em>never</em> runs out of stock.
<ul><li> Played with in the case of paintbrushes - some of the most rare and sought-after items on the site are paintbrushes, but the rare ones are explicitly magical in nature, and have the power to permanently change your pet's appearance. Non-magical paintbrushes exist and are more common... but there are nowhere near as many varieties of normal ones as there are magic ones, simply because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">don't serve much of an actual purpose</a>, and there is therefore no need to have over 100 types of boring normal paintbrushes.

The only way to get them is if they're sold at the morning market, gotten as a prize at the night market, a Mii makes them with a frying pan, or they spawn from the "hunger," "ritual," or "true love" dreams. Considering just how many foods there are in the game, the chance of any of these things happening is pretty low.

<ul><li> Tactical shooter <em>7.62mm High Calibre</em>, there are several guns that are extremely hard to find, and several guns that are extremely easy to find, based on both how far you are in the game's plot, and who you're buying from. On the other hand, <em>ammunition</em> can be absolutely impossible to find. At the beginning of the game, 9x19mm Parabellum bullets, one of the most universal rounds used today, cannot be found <em>anywhere</em>, while 7.62x25mm Tokarev rounds, which are designed for weapons that are barely even produced (the TT-33 Tokarev and the Skorpion submachine gun being the most common weapons to use the round), can be purchased in bulk. Later in the game, you might be struggling to find enough ammo for your common 5.56mm assault rifles, while tripping over Gyrojet rounds and 5.7mm pistol clips. To give an idea of how ridiculous this is: the 5.7x28mm round is used by <em>only two weapons in the entire world</em> (the Five-seveN pistol and the P90 PDW, three if you count an AR-15 conversion kit that isn't in the game) and aside from all models of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrojet">Gyrojet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being rare collector's items, <em>so is the ammunition</em> (selling for over $100 a round). The 5.56mm, on the other hand, is the standard rifle round used by NATO. 7.62x25mm Tokarev rounds genuinely are common, though, given ridiculously vast stocks of Soviet and Eastern Bloc surplus ammo that was exported to America after the fall of Communism.

<ul><li> Backpacks are considered extremely valuable because they allow you to carry much more equipment with you. While this is certainly a realistic benefit of a backpack in a survival scavenging scenario, the rarity of backpacks (especially in the original mod version) is pretty inexplicable. While backpacks are certainly handy to have, the odds that department stores would be stripped clean of backpacks following a societal collapse are very low, as people that are evacuating don't tend to ransack stores for backpacks. This is resolved somewhat in the Standalone version of the game where backpacks are more common (and can be crafted from basic materials), but you're still likely to be targeted and killed by other players just so they can upgrade their carrying capacity.
</li><li> Ghillie suits are another one, especially in the original mod, to the point that people will hunt you down just to get your ghillie suit because of how effectively you can hide while wearing one. Again, a ghillie suit would certainly be useful in a scenario where you're trying to remain hidden most of the time, but a ghillie suit isn't that hard to produce, and an effective one can be created from fairly basic components. This is actually addressed in the standalone version, where players can craft ghillie suits from burlap strips, which aren't that hard to find.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>, enemies use the <em>same</em> weapons that you can buy for large amounts of money from a shop. Pretty generic example, except- you <em>can</em> pick up the weapons. But you can't keep them of course, if you try to switch weapons, it just drops the thing. You will also find that to carry more throwing knives or phials of medicine/poison you will need to buy pouches. These can cost 6,000 florins, more that it costs to buy finely crafted weapons or armor, and can even outprice the extensive repair and refurbishment performed on the buildings around your villa. It's kept in the Crafting sections of the sequels. Somehow, it takes two humpback whaleskins to make a pistol holster, and only great white shark bones can be used for the final armor upgrade. This is averted in <em>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</em> and <em>Revelations</em>: If Ezio has somehow divested himself of his primary weapon and collects a weapon from the ground, he can keep it. If it was a type of weapon he didn't have beforehand, <em>it is added to his inventory.</em> Meaning that yes, Ezio <em>can</em> acquire expensive weapons via taking them off the cold, dead hands of his enemies. This gets a bit ridiculous in the 4th game with the crafting system. Not only does nobody in the game world apparently sell leather goods, Kenway refuses to use the same plan twice. So for no apparent reason he crafts every one of his pistol holsters out of different, increasingly absurd materials.

Items of the highest rarity level can be reliably earned at the game's special events. But the items just <em>below</em> that level can't be found at special events and only appear as very rare common items. As a result it is far, far easier to, say, earn the king and queen of the chess set than it is to earn the rook or bishop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Apples were so rare that, without hacking or using mods to get apples, the only legit way to get an Apple was to kill Notch if you met him on a server. It wasn't until the Beta 1.8 patch that added strongholds with chests that have a chance of carrying an Apple or more. Since the full game was released, apples have a 1/125 chance of falling from destroyed oak leaf blocks.
</li><li> Clay was also rather rare in the earlier days of the game, only available on coastal areas. Make a boat and get to searchin'. One version had a bug that brought it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, by only allowing clay to spawn at coordinates where x=z (effectively a single diagonal line through the world).
</li><li> Cookies were rare for a long time, to the point that they became a sort of trophy. This changed once cocoa beans became farmable and could be easily found in jungle biomes, instead of just in dungeon chests.
</li><li> Making a cake is a highly elaborate process: you must build a furnace and a stone or better pickaxe, find nine iron ore, smelt them into nine iron ingots, make three buckets, milk cows, grow or find wheat, gather sugar cane and make it into sugar, and find an egg laid by a chicken, then put them all together. That said, once you get to the point that you can produce <em>one</em> cake, it becomes fairly easy to make <em>more</em>.
</li><li> Carrots and potatoes are also pretty hard to get ahold of: you can only find them growing in NPC villages (which themselves are rather rare) or as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareDrop">Rare Drop</a> from zombies. Again, once you get one, it's relatively easy to get moreâ€”just plant it on a farm; since the yield for planting them will, more often than not, be <em>greater</em> than the input, after a while you'll have a surplus.
</li><li> Name Tags, the only legit way to give any mob a unique name outside of creative mode, can only be found inside chests located within a dungeon or by fishing.
</li><li> Pumpkins can be this on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360">Xbox 360</a> version of the game, since it's a finite space rather than the PC's nigh-unlimited world. If a cluster of pumpkinsâ€”usually around four or five at bestâ€”spawns, you will have to search far and wide to locate them. They end up being more rare than diamond ore. And even in the PC game, wild pumpkins can sometimes be hard to come by.
</li><li> Sponges can only be found deep underwater, in rare "ocean monument" dungeons filled with aggressive laser-shooting fish. They're the main reward for killing one of the Elder Guardians in these structures.
</li><li> Saddles clearly <em>should</em> be craftable from leather, which is easy to collect from cows, but for some reason you cannot do this. Instead, you have to track down a Leatherworker villager (not found in all villages) and trade with them until they offer a saddle. Occasionally, you can get one while fishing or in randomly-generated overworld chests. Seemingly the only purpose of this is to make horseback-riding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> (even though <em>finding</em> a horse can also be rather difficult in some cases).

Don't fret. They can give them to the boss by placing them in the trunks of special cars (think mobile armory). Doesn't quite work with the boat-mounted machine guns that Tony can later buy to wield himself. Also, it doesn't quite matter how much cash Tony has. Being able to purchase entirely legal items (such as a vending machine or a park bench) depends on how much his enemies respect him.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a> games, microchips are everywhere â€” weapons, ships, components of all kinds. And yet, good luck finding some in the universe â€” there's so much demand, and the production process involves such a convoluted chain of supply, that most chip factories are permanently empty â€” the few chips they produce are instantly snatched up by NPC traders. And if you do manage to be faster than the traders, expect to pay ludicrous prices for them. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you need to gather 75,000 of them for the last stage of the Hub plot.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>, the Declasse Asea should in theory be a common sight on the streets of Los Santos being based on the Chevrolet Aveo sedan. But in the original version of the game it only ever appears twice, once as an impossible to keep rental car, and again found parked at the end of a side-mission. If you do not take it after the latter, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>. Eventually it was made purchasable in <em>Online</em>, and can be found on the streets in the Enhanced version of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> suffers badly from this trope. Animal Fat, an important crafting ingredient, must be harvested from animals, it can't be purchased from butchers. Similarly, hides of domestic animals are only available by killing and skinning the animal in question, which requires robbing a farm and losing honor. You can't buy the skins anywhere. Finally, the camp request items are thoroughly mundane (things like a harmonica or a cheap novel), but must be found as loot and again can't be purchased from stores.

The car is supposed to spawn much more commonly within the Suburbs Expansion district, but the group of cars assigned to spawn don't due to a coding error, which means that it is common to play through the entire game without seeing one. Thankfully, it is possible to force the game into spawning a Quasar by driving other cars driven by rich civilians around Downtown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: Some of the rare drops from enemies fall into this. It makes sense why things like a poison cure-all or a wand of teleportation would be incredibly rare. A can of armor polish, a bandage, or a simple blindfold? Not so much. All three items are 1% drops from very specific enemies, all of which only appear in certain times or places. It's entirely possible for a player to spend actual hours farming enemies for these items (you'd think a player in possession of some fabric, an easy-to-make resource, could just <em>make</em> a blindfold).

Not least because stabbing each other in the back is the whole point of the game, and a low-clearance RED laser, for instance, will be defeated by not-quite-so-low-clearance ORANGE body armour.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?printed=true&amp;multiverseid=924">Oubliette<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a common card, and thus legal in Pauper, an all common format, where it is something of a staple. Unfortunately, it's a common from Arabian Nights, the second ever expansion, back when Wizards of the Coast vastly underestimated the game's popularity, so there are very few copies in print. To compound the issue, before a recent templating breakthrough, the official updated text was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">too long to fit on an actual card</a>, so it couldn't be reprinted. The result was a mere common selling for $20 or more, more than many of the best rares in Standard and most mythics.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Western Animation</h2>
<ul><li> Iron is apparently rare anywhere but on Earth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> universe.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Real Life</h2>
<ul><li> Diamonds, at least according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/4575/">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1982. This is less the case now since the DeBeers corporation, while still retaining significant market control, no longer has a monopoly on diamonds. The pricing is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.diamondcuttersintl.com/why-do-diamonds-cost-so-much/">still rather high<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> given their actual commonality (it's been said that you could give every living human a cupful of them, though not necessarily the highest quality ones).
</li><li> Currency
<ul><li> In the United States, two-dollar bills. The government is sitting on entire warehouses full of them because banks never ask for them because bank customers never ask for them. Since they rarely enter circulation there are many Americans who believe that they're not real money the first time they see them. The same is true of US dollar coins (not quite to the same extent) â€” the banks don't stock many because their business customers don't want them (partly their tills have places for one-dollar bills but not coins, and partly they believe their retail customers don't want them).
</li><li> This is true of Â£1 notes in Scotland - they are still legal currency and sometimes appear as change, though are not popular due to not being used in other parts of the UK unlike the coins (England discontinued their Â£1 notes in 1988).
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese CDs are often coveted and pricey outside of Japan for their bonus tracks and obi strips... but in Japan they are just regular CDs. To a lesser extent there are certain vinyl records that are common in their country of origin, most notably ABBA's Ring Ring, which is a bargain bin record in Sweden, and sells for around $30 consistently on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">eBay</a>. Most UK originals of Beatles albums on vinyl are common second hand, having sold many copies, but are always treated as rare premium items because of the demand for them. Stereo copies are harder to find than the mono ones though.
</li><li> AAAA batteries, used in such things as penlights, laser pointers, and styli for certain tablets like the Surface Pro 3. Go into an electronics store and you might find entire bins filled to the brim with AA and AAA batteries in packs of 10-20. AAAA batteries? "Quadruple-what? Sorry, we don't sell those." And when you do find some, they come in two-packs.
</li><li> Car manufacturers often make models that often don't sell well due to a lack of marketing, high pricing and so on, but also because they simply don't build that many. The latter point is expected with luxury or exotic car companies (as exclusivity is part of their appeal), however perfectly ordinary, no-frills, basic transportation can often wind up being <em>more</em> uncommon than a good chunk of other vehicles on the road. This is a slight aversion to the trope, as these cars tend to go very cheap second hand since nobody wanted them in the first place; car enthusiasts often wind up buying them with their strange rarity as an added bonus. That's why when you do see one years later, it tends to be in good condition and meticulously well maintained. This also applies to older cars that were mass produced into the millions, but have since become uncommon due to tighter maintenance / emission control, running costs, part availability, build quality and general age. The Volkswagen Beetle is the best example, as most that are seen these days are either fully restored or clunkers which will more than likely be sold to someone with the intention of restoring it.
</li><li> Used classic Macs sell on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">EBay</a> for almost as much as they did when they were new, simply because they're Macs.
