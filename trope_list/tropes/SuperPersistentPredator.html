In any case, they are unaccustomed to the land, but aren't exactly smart about being careful. Namely, they run into some monstrous beast that wants only one thing from them: lunch. After a dangerous escape (someone will probably be killed), the explorers dust themselves off, maybe laugh nervously, and try to get as far away from that thing as possible. No harm done, time to focus on getting to the shelter or something, right?
</p><p>But wait, what's that sound? Is it <em>following</em> them? Through rivers and mountains and who knows what else?
</p><p>You bet. Seems like this thing just won't give up until it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">another taste of human</a>. No matter how long it goes without a meal.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Basically, this predator will hunt the protagonists far beyond the call of common sense or even instinct, be it through fierce jungles, caves, canyons, or whatever else the protagonists have to go through. Once the climax comes by, the beast will most likely be right there, ready for one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>. If the heroes manage to find shelter, the predator(s) will go through an extreme amount of effort to break windows, unlock doors, or learn to bypass complicated security measures and then bash through a wall anyway to get to its prey. A situation like this might have you thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">it'd be more productive to just find something else to eat</a>. Sometimes it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explained away</a> by stating that they've got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">human intelligence</a>, but that just raises further questions about why an intelligent predator would expend so much effort to eat something that keeps eluding them. You might find an ethologist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">tearfully screaming</a> that <em>nobody</em>, animal or human, would be <em>this</em> vindictively persistent just for one difficult meal.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>But there's a reason this trope can work so very well. Note the word <em>human</em> intelligence. "Persistence hunting" isn't only a scarily good hunting strategy, provided the predator has enough stamina to keep chasing until the prey doesn't have the strength to keep running, it's also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">our</a></em> strategy, both in hunting and escaping (waiting for the predator to give up), thanks to our genes being arranged to favor stamina over speed. The use of this trope instantly makes the 'dumb animal' a credible threat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, since we don't have the option of outfoxing it until it gives up and goes away. No, this is something smart enough to see through our stratagems, that won't fall prey to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!</a> and stop chasing us, and will continue the hunt even as we tire. It's clearly going to come down to a climactic battle of man vs. nature. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Exciting, no?</a>
</p><p>Amusingly, this is one handwave that often wouldn't have been necessary  it's a well-known fact among biologists that intelligent predators can and <em>will</em> hunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">for fun</a>, even if they aren't hungry. For example, dolphins will torture and kill smaller breeds of dolphins as well as band together to <em>gang rape</em> young female dolphins  and males, they aren't picky; this goes double for orcas, which have been known to throw live seals around for hours on end, occasionally releasing them once they're done. Oh, and let's not forget about a few humans' habits. Of course, even in those cases, the predator isn't going to put itself through undue hardship and travel vast distances unless the reward is good enough. In particular, avoiding injury from prey is a prime motivation for most all solitary predators (social ones can potentially rely on other members of the group to provide food while they heal), as any inhibiting injury can spell starvation and most won't target something that is notably dangerous to dispatch unless they are starving or inexperienced at hunting (and in either case, they won't pose as much of a threat due to poor physical condition or poor decision-making, respectively).
</p><p>In practice, this is the animal version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a>. The latter trope also applies if this isn't a regular animal but a robot looking like one sent by a villain, an animal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">bewitched</a> and sent by a villain, or otherwise someone specifically tasked with chasing the particular victim(s). The inversion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalNemesis">Animal Nemesis</a> (especially in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobySchtick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobySchtick">Moby Schtick</a> setting). Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>, when the animal fights irrationally. Usually happens in places with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a>. Biological equivalent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI">Spiteful A.I.</a> The <em>entire universe</em> can be like this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, and more often than not <strong><em>will</em> be</strong> to someone unfortunate enough to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyDeliciousAndNutritious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyDeliciousAndNutritious">Supernaturally Delicious and Nutritious</a>. If this beast appears at the end to chase the villain away, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear">Exit, Pursued by a Bear</a>. This trope has <em>nothing</em> to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predator</a>, although that one <em>is</em> super persistent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">albeit for different reasons</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> had an amazing example of this. Young Gohan was sent on survival training with little more than a sword. Eventually, he gets the hang of it. And apparently gets chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex every morning. Not only does the T. Rex never get Gohan, every morning he knocks him out and he slices off part of his tail and eats it. And yet, despite his prey eating HIM every morning, the T. Rex continues to hunt Gohan. (In the beginning, anyway. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHunterBecomesTheHunted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHunterBecomesTheHunted">it starts running away from him</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo">Gyo</a></em> features numerous dangerous aquatic creatures trying to prey on the human populace, but one of the most notable and driven examples is the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangareader.net/gyo/4">land-mobile great white shark which attacks the protagonists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which goes to quite extraordinary lengths in its attempt to devour the heroes. Though the circumstances aren't entirely clear, this example may be justified, as the fish in question have been cybernetically (and, it is strongly implied, supernaturally) augmented for the specific purpose of killing and inflicting terror on humans; many are already dead or dying and seem more driven on by the machines attached to them rather than any natural urge to feed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> featured a herd of super-persistent elephants. Where they're chasing Nanami's raft across the ocean on <em>surfboards.</em>
</li><li> Justified/Invoked with the Abyss Eaters, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>, as they are conditioned to crave the flesh of one particular target. Said target is much, much stronger than them, but their persistence wears him down until he dies a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> after months in a constant state of battle.
</li><li> No one is quite sure why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Titans</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> prey on humans. It's been shown that they don't even need to eat humans to survive. The most basic definition of an Aberrant Titan seems to be one whose persistence is predicated on some factor other than "closest humans nearby". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed that titans are former humans that are subconsciously drawn to eat other humans in the hopes that one of them will be a titan shifter, which will grant <em>them</em> titan shifting powers that will finally allow them to return to human form.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> has a couple of these:
<ul><li> Pet Shop, a hawk with ice powers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>. If you enter the grounds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> DIO's mansion, Pet Shop will not stop chasing you until it has removed you as a threat. His ultimate opponent ends up being another animal, who has internal monologue about this behavior being frightening and unusual.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion">JoJolion</a></em>, there's a Stand called Blue Hawaii. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It infects the victim with a mindless, relentless pursuit of the intended target upon contact with a part of the User, ignoring their own safety to a horrifying degree. What makes this power terrifying is that it ironically still works well with groups, despite the fact it can only work on one person at a time.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Smirre in the anime series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulAdventuresOfNils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulAdventuresOfNils">The Wonderful Adventures of Nils</a></em>. While he only attacks the flock a few times in the book, he becomes a recurring antagonist in the anime, who follows the geese <em>all the way</em> from Scania to Lapland.
</li><li> One of the explicitly stated differences between regular animals and monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is that monsters' urge to kill always overpowers normal self-preservation instincts. Monsters will never stop attacking until they're killed, will attack even if clearly outnumbered and outgunned by their target(s), and unlike regular animals, don't retreat if injured by their quarry or their initial attack fails.

Justified in this case because the cutter has an injured jaw and isn't capable of hunting its normal prey. Jack is the first animal it has encountered in some time that combines being slow enough to hunt while being small enough to not be able to significantly fight back. Just his luck!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod">Pocket God</a></em>, a shark with a laser beam on its back is a regular adversary for the pygmies.

In <em>Helltrekkers</em>, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> storyline, it's given the vague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> that Rexes get literally addicted to the taste of human flesh.

It pursues the small Scar and his sick companion even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having caught <em>on fire</em>, being washed away by a flood of mud, and getting knocked out, and continues to grasp its victim with its jaws while the rest of him is hanging down from a cliff</span>!

</li><li> Maximus the Horse from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em> goes to incredible lengths to chase Flynn Rider, even getting into a <em>swordfight</em> with him. Justified in that he isn't looking for a <em>meal</em>, but a criminal at large, being essentially a police horse.
</li><li> Sharptooth (Tyrannosaur) from the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime">The Land Before Time</a></em> hunted the dinosaur heroes through mountains and a desert. <em>Land Before Time 5 The Mysterious Island</em> shows that Sharpteeth are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">intelligent enough to talk</a> (It's in a language the herbivores can't understand. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">Chomper</a> is bilingual.), so it could have been a particularly cruel and sadistic Sharptooth. Possibly justified in that the environment is dying and prey is extremely scarce, along with baby dinosaurs being easy prey compared to adults. The novelization expands on this, implying that Sharptooth was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">cruel and sadistic</a>, while also mentioning he wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">revenge on Littlefoot and company for blinding him in one eye</a>.

A brief glimpse of its thoughts reveals its reasoning: Jaq as a human is ten times bigger than a mouse, and therefore worth hunting for more food. It's a good thing it didn't start applying this line of logic for all humans.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dinosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a></em>: The Velociraptors hunting Aladar give up the chase when he reaches the herd, and are happy enough to feed on carrion from poor dinos who starve to death. The Carnotaur too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">knows when to fold them</a>; it leaves the protagonists after they kill its partner, and when confronted with an angry herd opts to go for the lone guy all by himself instead.
</li><li> Through most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCroods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCroods">The Croods</a></em>, the titular family are stalked by a <em>massive</em> sabertooth tiger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">with the colors of a blue and gold macaw</a>, dubbed "Chunky the Death Cat" by Gran.

All in all, it's justified because he's fleeing from the same cataclysm that the protagonists are so it makes sense that he's headed in the same direction as them and they would keep running into him as a result.
</li><li> Briefly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory">Finding Dory</a></em>: the three heroes are pursued by a giant squid, eventually managing to trick it into getting stuck in a huge shipping container.

<ul><li> The xenomorphs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> will hunt down and kill (or capture for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong">impregnation</a>) anything and everything near them. One theory raised by those making the movie was that the aliens were created as weapons of war, so that would also make their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> actions plausible. The prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus">Prometheus</a></em> justifies the xenomorphs' persistence with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that they are merely a by-product of the Engineers' bio-weapon.

</li><li> The aliens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienAbduction2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienAbduction2014">Alien Abduction (2014)</a></em> seem to be pretty insistent on getting all of the Morris family, though it isn't clear where it's the same group of aliens chasing them the entire time, or if they keep encountering different groups that are all hunting on Brown Mountain that night.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anaconda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anaconda">Anaconda</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License  Biology</a>, stating that the anaconda is some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> that enjoys killing <strong>so much</strong> that it will regurgitate its latest meal just so it can hunt and kill again. Needless to say, no real reptile would waste energy like that. Anacondas and other giant snakes were once <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">thought</a></em> to do that, but it turns out they only regurgitate their food if they're overly threatened while lethargic (btw, the snake in the movie should find a safe place and go into a self-induced <em>coma</em> after eating just one guy, nevermind a whole boat), or because they're, y'know, getting sick off it. Strangely, the movie also at least partially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies</a></em> this trope due to the fact that the protagonists in question spend pretty much their entire time in the anaconda's territory hunting <em>it</em>, so its actions could come off as self-defense, aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies aside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnacondasTheHuntForTheBloodOrchid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnacondasTheHuntForTheBloodOrchid">Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid</a></em>: Played with. The jungle expert notes that there's no way a single anaconda, even a giant one, is going to pursue the others after already eating one of them. However, the film justifies the trope by explicitly featuring a large group of hungry snakes who are all in the same area because of a mating season and the humans simply cannot avoid running into them. The travelling male snakes are hyper-aggressive for the same reason.
</li><li> In the shark horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bait3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bait3D">Bait 3D</a></em>, the sharks persistently hunt the surviving humans. It becomes more believable at the end when it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sharks were actually <em>trapped</em> in the convenience store along with the people and couldn't just swim away</span>.
</li><li> The wolf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Benji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Benji">Benji The Hunted</a></em>.
</li><li> The paperboy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead">Better Off Dead</a></em>, who pursues Lane on his bicycle throughout the whole movie to get the two dollars he owes him. Highlights include apparently multiplying in one chase until there's half a dozen identical paperboys chasing him, chasing him in the middle of the climactic ski race between Lane and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Roy Stalin</a> (<em>still</em> on his bicycle while wearing skis,) and even rushing him and Monique in the last few seconds of the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyawayShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyawayShot">Flyaway Shot</a> of the movie.

</li><li> The Tiger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurningBright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurningBright">Burning Bright</a></em>. Justified in that the Tiger was starved for nearly a week, and there was no other food supply.
</li><li> The cannibals of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheColony2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheColony2013">The Colony (2013)</a></em> never stop, despite the fact that chasing the protagonists is killing them off quickly. Perhaps justifiable since they really have no other source of food.
</li><li> An inversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke">Cool Hand Luke</a></em>: when Luke escapes prison, he runs so persistently that the bloodhound trailing him runs itself to death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crawl">Crawl</a></em>, real alligators would generally try to find somewhere sheltered to hunker down during a hurricane, not go hunting. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the gators are shown to have built a nest in the basement, so not only are they hungry, they also have eggs to defend</span>.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crocodile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crocodile">Crocodile</a></em> (but not so much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy">Sci-Fi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SyfyOriginalMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SyfyOriginalMovie">Original</a> sequels third and onward), featuring a crocodile (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">giant, naturally</a>) pursuing a group of half-dressed teenagers. One of them had one of her eggs in his backpack, fueling her maternal rage. The survivors are allowed to leave when they return it. However, while real life crocodiles actually do have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CubCuesProtectiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CubCuesProtectiveParent">fairly strong protective instincts</a>, they wouldn't chase after someone, and if a nest robber got away from it, it's not going to bother to chase it down.
</li><li> The sharks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea">Deep Blue Sea</a></em>. Tom Jane even points out that sharks don't particularly like the taste of people. Justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eating the people isn't the goal; getting them to open doors and flood the facility is. Although wiping them out is a beneficial bonus since no one else would know about the super intelligent sharks</span>...
</li><li> The sea monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepRising">Deep Rising</a></em>, who continue to relentlessly pursue the heroes despite suffering extreme gunfire trauma from doing so every time. One might also wonder why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire creature attacked the ship in the first place seemingly in pursuit of a bunch of microscopic humans, though the fact the opening of the movie shows an underwater graveyard littered with ships and whale skeletons implies the creature isn't indiscriminate on what it eats and has made a habit of snacking on human ships for quick meals</span>.
</li><li> The bear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEdge">The Edge</a></em> was a perfect example of this trope.
</li><li> This trope is the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostAndTheDarkness">The Ghost and the Darkness</a></em>. This is also a true story; the lions are stuffed and on display in the natural science museum in Chicago. Later studies have suggested that between the two lions, they only ate some 40 people; still a lot, but not the 140 originally claimed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a> II</em>, in which the predator is the small honey badger and the prey is a guy (and later, his boot).
</li><li> The baby Zillas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em>. As newly hatched animals, not only should their first priority be to feed themselves, which is easy given the abundance of available fish, but they should be starving and exhausted from the effort of hatching. Worse, they all start competing over an incredibly small number of people to eat (even at some points seeming to start fighting among themselves over who gets to eat the people). Actually justified, as all fish is gone by the time they start chasing humans (who smell like fish).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>, Godzilla tracks the MUTOs from one side of the Pacific to the other. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">considering Godzilla considers the entire Earth its territory and the MUTOs are an active threat to the biosphere</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrey">The Grey</a></em> features a pack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves">Savage Wolves</a> as a central plot point. Justified, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the humans were unknowingly moving deeper into the wolves' territory. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">last guy</a> finds himself in their den</span>.
</li><li> It from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItFollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItFollows">It Follows</a></em>, the closest definition of the trope that you can get. Once it targets you, it never gives up. It will always hunt you and will always find you. It cannot be killed or trapped. The only way to stave it off, is to have sex with someone else, but when It targets and kills them, it comes right back after you...
</li><li> While the shark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> is not much of an example, as it behaved much like an actual predator, the sequels play this very straight. Taken to ludicrous extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge">Jaws: The Revenge</a></em>, apparently tracking down people over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">hundreds of miles</a> (while our protagonists are <em>in an airplane</em>) in order to kill them in revenge for their father having killed a couple of other sharks a decade earlier. The novelization claimed this was due to an unexplained Voodoo curse, thus naming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a> trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> teetered over the edge of this trope for two films:
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>, the <em>T. rex</em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology">"Velociraptors"</a></em> aren't following the humans as much as chancing upon them and chasing them a bit. The first encounter with the <em>T. rex</em> plays this trope quite straight; it stops chasing the Jeep long after any real animal would've given up, not mentioning that it would be suicide for a <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> to try and run at the speeds that the Jeep is going. However, both the <em>T. rex</em> and the raptors in the original novel are <em>extremely</em> persistent.
</li><li> Unusually, the original film shows both the <em>T. rex</em> and the raptors losing all interest in humans when the chance to attack a <strong>rival</strong> predator, i.e. each other, comes along. As both had recently eaten, territoriality trumped hunger.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em>: the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> couple is chasing the humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">because they had kidnapped their baby</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">one of them is still walking around in clothing smeared with their infant's blood</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicParkIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicParkIII">Jurassic Park III</a></em>, however, they just throw reason to the wind, and have all the dinosaur predators behave this way:
<ul><li> The <em>Spinosaurus</em> chases the protagonists about a mile farther than reason would allow. One would think that there weren't any other dinosaurs around, or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">it was just that cruel</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Masrani Global website contains a datalog by Henry Wu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">which heavily implies</a> that the <em>Spinosaurus</em> was the first genetic hybrid made by InGen and was a prototype of some kind for the <em>Indominus rex</em> that was left on Isla Sorna.</span>
</li><li> They also stumble upon a <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> eating a dead dino with plenty of meat left, but when it sees the humans, it naturally starts pursuing them instead. Which incidentally leads it to the <em>Spinosaurus</em>, whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinosaurusVersusTRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinosaurusVersusTRex">it engages</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">is killed by</a>. It might have perceived them as a threat to its meal and is chasing them off ... in which case it ought to have <em>stopped</em> chasing them as soon as they were out of sight and gone back to its food.
</li><li> The <em>Velociraptors</em> of this film, however, chase the heroes because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">secretly steals their eggs</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em> justifies the <em>I. Rex</em>'s persistence by establishing that she's a hyper-aggressive super-predator that is killing for <em>sport</em> rather than for <em>food</em>. However, in one scene, the <em>I. Rex</em> gives up on chasing a pair of human children because they jumped over a waterfall and swimming is seemingly the one thing she is unable to do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</a></em>, the predators in Isla Nublar seem to place their hunger above their basic survival instincts:
<ul><li> Even as Mount Sibo showers the island with flaming rocks, a <em>Carnotaurus</em> takes its sweet time hunting a <em>Sinoceratops</em> and Owen instead of joining the stampede.
</li><li> Rexy herself ignores the volcanic eruption at first to attack the abelisaurid, thus keeping up the trend of her being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">Accidental Hero</a> and providing the movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Baryonyx</em> chases Claire and Franklin into a shelter that is being filled up with lava, not giving up on its prey even after being burned in the face. This is specially jarring when the official website mentions the <em>Baryonyx</em> as a species is only mildly aggressive and used to be part of an attraction where visitors would go kayaking at its territory.
</li><li> The only justified example is the <em>Indoraptor</em>, which is a successor to the <em>I. rex</em> from the previous movie and is just as ruthless and sadistic as she was.
</li><li> The film later zigzags the trope when the carnivores and herbivores completely ignore each other upon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being released into the garage of Lockwood's estate, as one would expect from a group of animals that are more concerned with avoiding being poisoned by a damaged ventilation system</span>.

Rex</em> who actually runs after Ann Darrow <em>with the corpse of a current kill in his mouth</em>. Some of the V. Rexes on the island actually <em>sacrifice themselves</em> in their attempts to kill her. And when given the chance to bite Kong versus swallowing Ann, they always went for Ann. The <em>Venatosaurus</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaptorAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaptorAttack">raptor</a>-pack comes a close second, trying to chomp humans in the middle of a <em>Brontosaurus</em> stampede, then persisting in chasing down hapless cameramen, rather than gorging on several thousand tons of fresh bronto meat that was lying there waiting for them.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Komodo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Komodo">Komodo</a></em>. The komodos relentlessly pursue the protagonists, but there are several of them and they are stated to be starving. Plus, this trope is actually played straight by <em>real</em> komodo dragons, which bite large prey and then follow it relentlessly until it keels over from infection and venom.

The resident <em>T. rex</em>, Grumpy, actually <em>is</em> all set to give up on chasing Marshall, Will, and Holly after they prove to be more trouble than they're worth. That's until Dr. Marshall insults the <em>T. rex's</em> intelligence, causing it to hold a grudge against him for the rest of the film. Marshall keeps insulting it several more times, just as it seems the <em>T. rex</em> is ready to give up, fueling the creature's rage.

Though it would be justified, since the kaiju <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are not natural predators, but bioweapons created solely to wipe out humanity.

Often these hidden creatures, who are blind (and apparently don't have a sufficient sense of smell) but hunt by sound and are very fast and near indestructible, home in and strike very quickly if you make a noise—but if you evade them, they'll still prowl around, listening very closely for further sound or movement, and not go away....
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ROTOR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ROTOR">R.O.T.O.R.</a></em> revolves around the titular police <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> accidentally activating and going on a rampage by following its primary program to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner">Judge, Jury, and Executioner</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShallows">The Shallows</a></em>, the shark repeatedly attacks Nancy and kills several other humans who get into the water even though there is a whale carcass nearby. It is implied due to the scars on its face and the spear stuck in its side that it has had a bad history with humans and attacks them out of anger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SharkAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SharkAttack">Shark Attack</a></em>: The sharks are intentionally (and as the hero—who's a marine biologist—notes, rather uncharacteristically) going after humans.

Kirk is being chased by some shambling furry thing. Then a giant red ant bursts out of the ice, bites the furry thing, tosses it aside... and starts chasing Kirk. Even though the shambling furry thing was bigger (but still bite-sized to it) and it had already attacked it. Makes significantly more sense if you interpret the red creature as being territorial as opposed to hungry. It frequently stops to roar at Kirk, something a hunting animal is unlikely to do but an animal trying to intimidate a supposed threat might, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spock Prime is able to run it off with a mere signal flare once it enters <em>his</em> territory, the cave</span>.

To name a few of the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFail">unintentionally hilarious</a> examples:
<ul><li> In <em>Kaw</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows">Creepy Crows</a> get infected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">Mad Cow</a> (?!) disease <em>after</em> eating clearly diseased rotting cow flesh. As soon as they go crazy, they decide to exclusively go for the human protagonists (not even any other areas, just those few people). This includes <em>waiting on a bus</em> while the humans cry and then <em>throwing rocks</em> at the bus in a desperate attempt to get inside. Later, they slam themselves against a diner in order to get in and eat the people inside, before they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">inexplicably die</a>. You'd think there weren't any animals in the forest. Subverted in that the super persistent predators starve to death, just as they would in real life.
</li><li> Shockingly averted in the (surprisingly good) reimagining of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLandThatTimeForgot2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLandThatTimeForgot2009">The Land That Time Forgot</a></em> (which starred and was directed by <strong>C. Thomas Howell</strong>) in which the Rex only chases the humans when they enter its territory to steal food, and all it does is just try to run them off.
</li><li> Used as a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus">Sharktopus</a></em> - one character wonders why the eponymous creature is going out of its way (such as attacking boats and <em>going over land</em>) to attack humans rather than just hunt aquatic creatures, and it turned out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">there had been secret changes to its genome to make it a better killer</a>.

Earl compares their patience to that of Job. They track prey endlessly, and if the prey is somewhere they can't reach, they wait it out for <em>days</em> if need be. The only time they'll leave is when the prey dies of dehydration/starvation or if they're distracted by a sufficiently loud noise/vibration nearby that screams "easier meal" for them.

While fleeing, they morph to escape, and Marco morphs into an osprey, his standard bird choice, that has both the ability to fly and should logically be too small to keep the predator's attention. However, instead of giving up once the already-small meal becomes an even <em>smaller</em> meal, as Marco logically expects it to do, the dinosaur keeps chasing him, and actually begin to <em>tear apart trees that are standing in the way</em>. Marco ultimately realizes that food has stopped being the point of the chase, and that the Rex is chasing him out of pure blood-lust and rage.
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> series with Trolls. Apparently to them, humans are by far the most deliciousest things <em>ever,</em> and after trying one, a troll will do <em>anything</em> to eat more. Also, as subterranean predators, they have <em>extremely</em> finely-tuned senses, so that exposure to the surface tends to cause them sensory overload which causes severe brain damage, usually removing most of their survival instinct.
</li><li> The enormous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a> Moriarty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse">Dinoverse</a></em> stalks the four teenagers-in-dinosaur-bodies for hundreds of miles after meeting them on a beach. Getting pulled into the ocean by an Elasmosaurus, having rocks flung into its face after an earthquake, and a flash flood do not deter him. Bertram gives a weak explanation by saying that since this group of animals would never normally travel together, they might signal disease. Certainly they're big enough to make a good meal, but this is a lot of effort, especially considering how easy it is to forage for food on the seashore. Mike, who's in the body of a T. rex himself, thinks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a>.

Justified, as like the other Shadowen on the island, it <em>hates</em> the Elves for creating it in the first place.

<ul><li> The Tracker Jacker wasps. Their name is pretty self-explanatory, as they were bred to A) track down their prey and B) (hi)jack their victim's nervous system with their Grade A hallucinogenic venom. They home in on the first person they see and don't stop until said person is stung.
</li><li> In <em>Mockingjay</em>, there were the lizard-mutts, which were engineered to hunt and kill Katniss specifically, but will viciously munch on anything or any<em>one</em> in their way.

Salvatore's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIcewindDaleTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIcewindDaleTrilogy">Streams of Silver</a></em> act like predators (they are trying to kill and eat the heroes, after all), and they are <em>extremely</em> persistent.

</li><li> The novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge">Jaws: The Revenge</a></em> has a shark that somehow understands the concept of revenge, and as such, keeps coming back.

It was actually justified because (as Malcolm realises) the raptors discovered that humans are an easy meal and become a favoured prey, as with some modern man-eaters. This is contrasted with the wild raptors that appear near the end of the book, that all but ignore Grant when he infiltrates their nest. In the second book it was explained that because raptors were so intelligent, being born and raised without actual raptor "parents" to raise them properly turned them into violent and chaotic creatures. Meanwhile, the Tyrannosaur seemed to be stalking Dr. Grant and the kids in particular, even leaving behind a Hadrosaur kill to pursue them down a river. It starts to become pretty obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary">Rule of Scary</a> when at one point it's waiting at the bottom of a waterfall with its jaws open, hoping they'll fall inside.

The attempted justification for this is that the dinosaur has evolved the tactic of pursuing its meals relentlessly, thus ensuring that, eventually, it will eat. Which still doesn't make sense, as eventually it risks burning more calories trying to catch the prey than it'd get from eating it.

It's noted several times that it is acting with disturbing intelligence and malevolence for an animal, hinting that there's something more to it. Considering that humans have been spending the last six years systematically slaughtering chasmfiends while they are in their vulnerable pupating stage, it's not impossible that it's out for revenge.

Zombies will chase humans for as long as it takes to catch them. A zombie will chase a human into the sea, over a cliff, into a raging inferno, it doesn't matter. A zombie will go after any living prey that it can find, and eat it to death. Justified, in that a zombie literally has no sense of self-preservation, just a ravenous hunger for flesh.
<ul><li> In the chapter where the astronaut from the International Space Station is interviewed, he mentions one zombie that chased after a small animal in the desert. When the animal burrowed under the sand, the zombie started digging for it, even as sand continued to pour back into the hole, filling it just as fast as it was dug. The zombie was digging nonstop for <strong>five straight days</strong> before it apparently lost the animal's scent and gave up.

Once aggroed they would chase you indefinitely until you crossed a zone line, and if they belong to a species that could link they would bolster their numbers with any others they passed. Once their prey crossed the zone line they would then slowly wander back towards their spawn location, aggroing anyone else who had the misfortune of crossing their path. Popular EXP zones like the Jungles, Garlaige Citadel, and Crawler's Nest were easily paralyzed if one group pulled something high level they shouldn't or linked far too many mobs at once. Every group in the area would have to flee the zone and wait for an "all clear" from a dead person still inside once everything had left the area. Anyone zoning back in too soon would just pull the danger back to the zone line. Mercifully, Square finally tethered some mobs to despawn if pulled too far, and any mob that loses its aggro at a zone line despawns to eliminate the danger to bystanders.
</li><li> Many of the monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> seem to go to rather crazy lengths to catch the party. The ones that teleport, however, won't leave you alone until you leave the room, and a few monsters might just keep going.
</li><li> Most enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> will give up chasing you after you run away for a while. This makes fair sense for things like animals, that were likely just guarding their territory, and are placated by leaving them alone. It makes less sense when you run right past a guard to an enemy military base, and he stops chasing you once you're 50 yards inside the base. Guess it's not their problem anymore.
<ul><li> Played straight in dungeons, where enemies that spot you will hunt you down no matter how much you try to escape. This is actually beneficial in most instances, as now players can have a tank pull a huge group of mobs from a broad swath of the dungeon, group them up, and then take full advantage of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> attacks to kill everything <em>much</em> faster than they would have killing things one at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a> III</em>, you will often encounter packs of animals in the wilderness, from large birds to wolves, rhinos, and other beasts. Without exception, as soon as you attack a member of the pack, the entire group will go into berserk attack mode and chase you to the ends of the earth until either you or they are dead. One upside of this is that you can lead them into populated areas like cities, where the guards will assist you in taking them down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GrimDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GrimDawn">Grim Dawn</a>:</em> Nemesis monsters act like this. Unlike any other creature and boss, which will eventually head back to their spot once you've ran enough, Nemesis monsters will always know where you are once they've seen you and will <em>never</em> stop chasing you until you leave to a load-in area or use a riftgate to escape; they'll even chase you right into towns like this. Somewhat justified in their origins, as a Nemesis only spawns once its respective faction <em>hates your guts</em> because you've killed so many of them (even if it gets odd with a faction like the Beasts, which despite being barely sentient if at all still send a titanic half-wooden chupacabra after you), so like the name indicates they're out for retribution against you specifically, likely sent by their faction directly to hunt you down.
</li><li> Throughout the hovercraft chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> the player is attacked repeated by Hunter-Choppers, but the fact that though the player gets a chance to shoot one down during the final confrontation at the dam the others just fly off for repairs, and the rebels that mount a machine gun on your hovercraft only mentioning a singular Hunter-Chopper, it's implied that it's the exact same one hounding you throughout the entire chapter and only getting temporarily driven off until you finally take it down for good at the dam.
</li><li> Illidan can very easily be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em>. He moves fairly fast to begin with, and he can use his Sweeping Strike and Dive abilities to catch up to a fleeing hero. And in case that wasn't enough, he can also take The Hunt, so that if you do manage to escape his chase but then pass back into his team's line of sight, he can <em>dive on you from across the map</em>, bellowing <em>"You! Are not! PREPARED!"</em>
<ul><li> Most of the time, people <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">don't</a></em> do this, at least in higher levels of play. Overextending while chasing a wounded enemy hero is a very good way to get isolated from your team and killed, meaning you feed the enemy team experience and cost your side a player while you wait to respawn, for no benefit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Telltale's <em>Jurassic Park</em> video game, the T-rex will constantly attack the protagonists throughout the game despite killing enough dinosaurs over the course of it that it REALLY has no reason to. The only thing that can distract it from chasing them is a Triceratops trying to kill it, and even then, it still takes a moment to divert its attention from the Triceratops to attack the humans.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> <em>Jurassic Park</em> game, you can play as a Velociraptor whose sole motivation is to eat Dr. Grant. Each level the raptor is following his scent, going through the same levels you'd go through playing as Dr. Grant. She <em>could</em> eat the hundreds of dinosaurs and armed guards she kills trying to get to Grant, but no. Maybe the raptor has a thing against paleontologists (though there is mentioned in the narrative that the Raptor is trying to follow Grant to get off the island, rather than kill him).

A lot of time, you can divert the attention of a predator away from you by killing something smaller, causing the larger enemy to take the easier meal. There are even giant dragonflies and grubs you can stab with a spear, specifically for creating such distractions.
</li><li> The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a>, The Eliminator, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHeartsCoded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHeartsCoded">Kingdom Hearts coded</a></em>. In the game, is it the only enemy that not only teleports to keep you within its attack range, but after a certain level it will teleport <em>between sector rooms</em>. This is rather unfortunate considering its power level.
<ul><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> game takes this trope to its most ludicrous extreme: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan">Sabor</a> the leopard repeatedly stalks and attacks a boy who can shoot fire and lightning from his body.

All of his abilities can be cast while moving, one greatly increases movement speed until a basic attack on an anemy, at which point he will launch both champions in his last move direction. His ultimate allows him to dravel through walls, trees, et cetera. You will never escape a Hecarim unless your team helps you.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">Moscow mutants</a> will go to great lengths for a meal, even going so far as to attack armored humans with automatic weapons. Similarly, they are not deterred by gunfire, bright light, or the smell of their own dead, as most normal animals. On the other hand, shooting them will usually cause them to back off momentarily, they do eventually flee if enough of their pack is killed, they are frightened of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">anomalies and ghosts that infest the haunted tunnels</a>, and they will also avoid large fires (though they will brave them if there is no other option). Totally averted with some other mutants — Librarians, the possibly-once-human, possibly sentient mutants that infest the Lenin Library and the Military Archives beneath it are simply territorial, and will even back down if you look them right in the eye (in the novel, one even tells Artyom to "go away" in Russian), and the Biomass under D6 ignores you until you start actively trying to kill it. The Demons, winged mutations of the tigers in the Moscow Zoo, will not try to follow you inside, though they will opportunistically try to snatch you if you spend too long outside or near windows. Overall, the unusual persistence of the Moscow predators is justified by the scarcity of food in the Metro — they are just as starved as the humans they feed on, and they really can't afford to ignore such a tempting target as an adult human (or better yet, woman and children he's guarding) unless they have no other option.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight">Last Light</a></em> expands a bit on the situation, giving some of the mutants additional motivations for their behaviour and pushing the game closer to a full aversion of the trope. Watchmen are shown to possess a limited capacity for restraint and rational thought, being content to leave Artyom alone so long as they're not starving or if he doesn't provoke them. They are also more apt to break off an attack if they lose too many of their own, and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Baby Dark One</span> points out that they fear what they don't understand when lending Artyom his psychic facilities to seek them out in cover with. On the other hand, Demons and the new Bear boss-mutant are both shown at various points in the game to be simply protecting their young, and the same is implied for the Nosalis Rhino (a Nosalis brood mother who watches over a large pack of them). The aquatic Shrimp are docile unless bothered by disturbances in the water, which a group of Reds promptly create while carelessly boating through Shrimp-infested tunnels.

(The SA-X is fairly easy to fool, though, not being able to find Samus should she slip out of immediate view.) On the other hand, since Metroids <em>eat</em> X-parasites, Samus effectively plays the role of Super Persistent Predator in the game itself. Although technically Samus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">also a Metroid in this game</a>, and only this one.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> inverts this. Most large monsters tend to flee from the player after exhausting themselves or sustaining large amounts of damage, and usually have to be chased in order to be taken down. In other words, the <em>player</em> is an example. Also, when hungry, monsters will leave to find easier game, generally going for the easiest to kill herbivores available or even scavenging, than the heavily armed human in front of them. They will also revert to a neutral state if you leave an area to heal up. All in all, monsters in Monster Hunter really want nothing to do with the hunter at all and will make any effort to scare him/her away or flee themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Quite sad, really</a>.

This bear would follow your wagon for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses">thousands of miles</a></em> until you managed to kill it.

Even then, the Bulbear's corpse will have to be harvested, or it will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">come back to life.</a>

</li><li> In gameplay, running away from a wild Pokemon is determined primarily by the difference in speed between the combatants. Fast wild Pokemon will simply not let you escape from battle. Some of them even use a move (Mean Look) or an inherent Ability (Magnet Pull, Arena Trap) to lock you into the battle until either your 'Mon has fainted, or they have been knocked out or caught.

And since you <em>cannot</em> use Fast Travel while someone is attacking you, it's entirely possible to get yourself stuck inside a dungeon with aggro'ed enemies waiting outside and with no ability to fight back. Add in the fact that the enemies are capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">stun-locking</a> you if enough of them are beating you at the same time, and the fact that the game has limited saves, and you have a recipe for potentially making the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.

He has the decency, though, to not follow you into safe rooms. In-story, the Mr X was released to clean up any survivors of the outbreak and recover the G-virus and as such, hunts Leon, Claire, Ada, and Sherrie relentlessly, even shrugging off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being hit with a van that then explodes, being gored by Birkin, falling into molten metal (in the original), and even finds his way into the Umbrella lab.

They're frail, old men with canes and walkers by the time they decide to leave in the year of <em>2090</em>, and the equally-old and frail panther <strong>still</strong> wants to chase them (despite not being able to eat meat anymore)!
</li><li> Zig the hyena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZigAndSharko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZigAndSharko">Zig &amp; Sharko</a></em> spends every episode going through outrageous lengths and a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> in hopes of capturing and eating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent">mermaid</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> episode "Cabana Fever" features Pete going on vacation to a tropical island and running into a shark that's so determined to eat him that it climbs onto the land and chases him to a volcano.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>: In "The Sword", Adora, Bow, and Glimmer get attacked by a giant insect creature. It keeps attacking them even when Glimmer blinds it with her light powers and Bow shoots it with arrows. When Adora turns into She-Ra for the first time, the creature does turn docile, but when the transformation cuts out, it resumes its attack. And when the heroes fall into a ravine, it follows them.
</li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LifeWithFeathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LifeWithFeathers">Life with Feathers</a></em> where a lovebird is so depressed after his wife leaves him (on the logic that lovebirds mate for life) that he tries to commit suicide by feeding himself to Sylvester (incidentally, his first appearance). Sylvester, in turn, concludes that there has to be something wrong with the bird and refuses to eat him in case he's poisonous. The bird pursues Sylvester relentlessly through the cartoon.

<ul><li> <em>Humans</em> are perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers">the most successful example of this trope</a>, called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting">Persistence Hunting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. We are nearly tireless by the standards of most other animals, though hardly fast animals — in our hunter-gatherer days, our favored tactic seems to have been following an animal at a jog until it simply dropped of exhaustion and heatstroke and either died there or had its head bashed in with a rock. This is still practiced by many African tribes. (Before you try it on your local whitetails, though, remember that these people are hunting in vast expanses of flat land; there's no forests for the animal to hide in or hills for it to vanish over.)
<ul><li> There is a well-known pack animal which uses persistence as its primary hunting strategy: Wolves. Kind of makes sense that these two species would have gotten along fairly well in ancient times, doesn't it? Man's Best Friend might have originated as a pack of wolves and a pack of humans getting to know each other while chasing down the same big game, teaming up to take it down, and sharing in the kill.
</li><li> African wild dogs are persistent hunters. They will chase their prey until it tires out, sometimes for miles.
</li><li> Hyenas are also known to do this.
</li></ul></li><li> Birds like seagulls, crows and caracaras really like to obsessively harass specific targets over long periods of time.
</li><li> Many predators really do behave this way, though not to the ridiculous extents often depicted in fiction (usually employed by a group of smaller predators pursuing one large prey animal, whereas many movies and TV shows have it reversed). The constant pursuit denies the prey a chance to feed, drink, or rest. Eventually the prey will either collapse or be too weak to defend itself. This can easily be sped up by injuring the prey or forcing them into dangerous terrain. These tactics can allow a slower, weaker predator to take down big game. The predator runs the same risks, so this can often be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">make-it or break-it tactic.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2377154/Eight-ton-orca-leaps-15ft-air-finally-capture-dolphin-hour-chase.html">This Killer Whale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is certainly one. After chasing a dolphin for two hours, it made a four-meter-high jump to catch it. Other Orcas will drag whales and batter them until they can't fight back anymore and then drag it down to drown it.
</li><li> Cracked.com's "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15816_the-5-most-horrifying-bugs-in-world.html">The 5 Most Horrifying Bugs in the World<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" describes killer bees as follows (chemicals emitted by the detached stingers of the bees who already stung you attract the rest of the hive to continue the assault):
<div class="indent">Regular bees will give you about nine seconds of being too close to the hive before deciding you're a threat and then attacking you. So it's pretty easy to just walk past them without any screams. And if you do get them after you, they'll consider you to be 'chased off' after about 300 feet. <br/>Africanized bees do not roll this way. They give you half a second of being too close before they decide it is time to completely fuck your shit up and empty the entire hive — tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of angry, angry bees. When you run, flailing and crying and soiling yourself while screaming "JESUS CHRIST I'M <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">COVERED IN BEES</a>," they will chase you for over half a mile.
</div></li><li> Man-eater animals (that is, animals that have made humans part of their regular diet) behave like this, that's because compared to other animals, humans are ridiculously easy to kill, and once a predator learns that, it will tend to keep hunting the "easy meat". See the individual examples below.
<ul><li> The Tsavo man-eaters, a pair of maneless Tsavo lions, killed/consumed between 35/135 Indian laborers working on the Tsavo railway bridge in British East Africa. Even lighting campfires and building redoubts out of thorns didn't stop them. Eventually, Col. John Henry Patterson, a real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter">Great White Hunter</a>, set off to kill them. He shot the first, but it escaped, then started stalking him. He shot it four more times, and it eventually died of its wounds. He found it lying dead in an ambush position where it had been waiting for him. He ambushed the second lion, shooting it five times. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">It got up and charged him.</a></em> Three more bullets put it down. Patterson claimed it died trying to leap over a fallen tree branch, <em>still trying to charge him.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">Then they spent 25 years as a rug.</a> A modern analysis of the attacks shows that the lions may actually have been an <em>aversion</em> to the trope: the reported attacks were all during the dry period when the lions' normal prey was scarce. During the rainy season, when herd animals were more common, they actually stopped attacking humans. These two were more recently turned into a museum exhibit (with one of them lying down, since the rug didn't include his belly). See the Movies entry for the movie based (somewhat loosely) on the event.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champawat_Tiger">The Champawat Tiger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> rivals, or <em>exceeds</em>, any serial killer in history. This man-eating tigress killed <em>436 people</em> before being shot. Followed closely behind by the Panar Leopard, which claimed <em>400 victims</em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_(crocodile)">Gustave<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. What's scarier than an enormous Nile crocodile? An enormous Nile crocodile that not only has a taste for eating humans, but enjoys torturing them too. He's reckoned to be nearly 70 years old, and, thanks to hundreds of human corpses dumped in the Rizizi river during Burundi's civil war, he has a taste for <em>Homo sapiens</em>. He is believed to have killed nearly 300 people, and according to locals, doesn't eat them all - he kills because he enjoys it. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">this horrific abomination is still out there.</a> A National Geographic expedition tried to capture him using a steel cage and a live goat. After the camera went out one stormy night, they found the cage the next morning, the goat gone, smashed to pieces at the bottom of a lakebed. So what makes him "super-persistent?" Well, apart from his enormous size, his other distinguishing features are machine gun scars, a grenade wound, and <em>having an enormous bullet hole in the middle of his face.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">And he's still going</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> Komodo Dragons fit the bill; they first take a bite out of their prey, and through a combination of mild anticoagulant venom (ie, the wound bleeds out) and severe laceration from the teeth, it's only a matter of time before the animal drops from blood loss, trauma, paralysis, and infection. And if it doesn't die in minutes, the dragon will attack again and again until it drops. Most depictions have long-distance tracking as the norm, but in reality they simply keep chasing and biting it until it falls. They also usually shred the legs and ankles to keep prey from running.
</li><li> Some paleontologists believe that many large predatory dinosaurs may have practiced this method of killing as well. This is really the only way to kill giant sauropods, which are simply too dangerous to kill by any other method of attack. Tyrannosaurs and spinosaurs, however, not being sauropod hunters, were physically incapable of hunting this way.
</li><li> Various saber-toothed predatory mammals also, although in their case it was inflict-deep-gushing-slashes-and-wait, not inflict-infectious/toxic-bites-and-wait.
</li><li> Great white sharks still use that strategy to prey on elephant seals. This may also be the real reason sharks release human victims (so they die of blood loss). One should emphasize "may" though as sharks also release animals they realize are not worth eating (due to not having enough blubber, not tasting right, and such), and the "usually a single bite followed by leaving the human alone" scenario is true for shark attacks in general, not just attacks from species that prey on large pinnipeds.
</li><li> Gila Monsters of the American Southwest use many of the same methods of the Komodo Dragon (infectious bites and all). However, instead of biting multiple times, Gila Monsters will bite and <em>mechanically latch their jaws shut</em>. However, this is primarily a defensive attack, as gila monsters and their close cousins the Mexican beaded lizard subsist primarily on a diet of eggs.
</li><li> When a fishing spider (<em>Dolomedes</em>) is attacked by a parasitic wasp, the spider will usually try to evade it by going underwater. However, some wasps have been observed following the spider underwater, stinging it, then dragging it out of the water.
</li><li> Australian Funnelweb Spiders are VERY territorial and VERY aggressive. That's not the scary part (well, not the <em>scariest</em> part). The scary part is that if you mess with one and get away from it, if you come back the next day, it will <em>remember</em> you, and be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">angry</a> enough to come after you. This spider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">holds a grudge</a>!</em>
<ul><li> A few desert species of spider will envenomate a target and let it escape because the spider doesn't have the strength to hold it in place. They will then follow it until the venom has taken effect.
</li></ul></li><li> Corvids (crows, ravens, magpies etc) are some of the most intelligent animals around and though not specialised hunters, they will opportunistically stalk and kill (small) prey such as young or injured birds. When doing so they can learn and adapt to get what they want, stalking prety endlessly, teaming up with others to gang up on prey items or even employ complex diversion strategies to separate chicks from the parent bird.
</li><li> Bees are smart enough that, if you mess with them and then try to escape by diving underwater (a common-knowledge trick that doesn't work), they'll wait for you to come up again and <em>then</em> attack.
</li><li> Many external parasites, like ticks and lice, probably evolved their present lifestyles by way of this trope: from opportunistic blood-feeders that would nibble any large animal they chanced upon, to short-term hitchhikers that clung to a blood source for brief interludes, to obligate ectoparasites that live full time on a single host and only transfer to another when it dies or has offspring they can colonize.
