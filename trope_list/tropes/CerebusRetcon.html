There is however a way to make these early funny elements consistent with the rest of the story: giving them a Cerebus Retcon. The Cerebus Retcon gives a rational, often cynical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> explanation or interpretation of early gags, frequently by giving them a late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, either for drama or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>.

As such, this trope is used to cover both cases, since the audience is now told to perceive a lighthearted moment in a more serious light either way.

There was also an issue set during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWarII">Civil War II</a></em> where Nadia tried to build a way to get the feuding superheroes to see everything and breaking down into tears when it blew up. At first, this was seen as a naive girl trying to make her way through life and her new world outside the Red Room. This all changed in issue #5 of her 2018 series, where it was revealed that she has bipolar disorder (inherited from her father, Hank Pym) and that a lot of her earlier attitude stems from it.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelAndTheApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AngelAndTheApe">Angel and the Ape</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> comic about a girl named Angel and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick">gorilla named Sam</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime">fighting crime</a> in the city, with the oddity of the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">never being mentioned</a> (except everyone assumed Ape was a very hairy human). When it was revived in 1991 it was explained that Sam was actually the grandson of Gorilla Grodd, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">DC Universe</a> simian supervillain. Like Grodd, Sam has psychic powers, which in his case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">make him look human to others</a> as long as he concentrates.
</li><li> You know how Jughead from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> wears that crown hat thingy? In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> when the comic began it was an actual trend to cut up fedoras; decades later this is forgotten and Jughead wears a funny hat because he's Jughead. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015">Archie Comics (2015)</a></em> on the other hand has him as the son of a wealthy family who was swindled out of everything and became poor. He cut up the hat he once wore as a sign of being all high-society.
</li><li> Antoine D'Coolette, the easily scaring comic relief of the group who Sonic loves to make fun of is discussed by Bunnie in Issue 46 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>. Turns out he was once much more valiant and composed way before Sonic joined the Freedom Fighters, and clever enough to save Bunnie's life on one occasion. He lost his way after his father was roboticized, wearing his father's uniform and attempting desperately to win Sally's love for the purpose of filling the emotional void his loss left him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Batman R.I.P.</a></em> and the events leading up to it are one big Cerebus Retcon. All that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> wackiness? All either hallucinations caused by Scarecrow or Joker gas, or delusions of a young Batman as he took part in a dangerous mental experiment to try to understand the Joker's mind. Also, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a> was retconned into being a spy who was hired to find out Bruce's identity, before she fell in love with him and ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> villain the Mad Hatter was always slightly creepier than most, but in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a></em> miniseries it became canon that he was a serial rapist, a drug addict, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking">only ate food with hats on it</a>, and was afflicted with macrocephaly. For a villain whose hat (harhar) is casual mind control and was drawn after a Tenniel illustration, this worked surprisingly well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> originally joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> #100, where Cap asked him to become an Avenger as a personal favor. Decades later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics">Christopher Priest</a>'s <em>Black Panther</em> run revealed that T'Challa only agreed to join so he could spy on the Avengers, a revelation that subsequently created tension with his teammates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a>, underwent this when brought back by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker">Ed Brubaker</a>. The original version of his origin was that he was a cheery fanboy of Cap who accidentally discovered his secret identity and thus was recruited as his partner to keep the truth from getting out. Then Bucky died in a plane explosion and after that putting kids in harm's way looked like a less appealing idea for Marvel. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaWinterSoldier">Captain America: Winter Soldier</a></em> then retconned his first origin as propaganda, with the truth being that Bucky was an orphan who grew up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryBrat">on a military base most of his life</a> and when partnered with Steve was essentially a teenage assassin, intended to do the black ops work Captain America couldn't be seen doing. So Bucky went from kid sidekick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> when he was brought back as Winter Soldier.</span>
<ul><li> And long prior to that, there was the retcon that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon">The Falcon</a> was a former pimp and drug dealer who was brainwashed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Mole</a> in the superhero community. The whole thing is so contentious that it's been retconned in and out of continuity several times.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom">Captain Atom</a> was retconned after <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, his Silver Age adventures were turned into a cover story by the government to establish his superhero identity.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a></em>, which in later issues liked to go back and explain some of the more humorous characters and situations of the early issues as being much more serious than originally thought. For instance, a minor gag in the fourth issue was later retconned (over 180 issues later!) as having been a tremendously significant event which kicked off a chain reaction that changed the course of Cerebus's life and led directly to all his eventual misery. Had said gag not occurred, Cerebus would have actually ended up as ruler of the world.

<ul><li> Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, Hal Jordan seemed to have the <em>least</em> dramatic backstory of any DC superhero: he was a cocky, handsome, all-American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">test pilot</a> who spent his free time trying to woo his boss's daughter, and was on uncannily good terms with his family. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>' post-Crisis run went into a bit more detail about Hal's background, and revealed that his arrogance actually masks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown">some truly sad experiences</a>. For starters, he saw his father die in a test flight when he was just a child, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">his brown bomber jacket</a> is actually a memento of his father. For another thing, his mother disowned him after he ran away from home to join the Air Force on his 18th birthday, and refused to speak to Hal on her deathbed. This led a guilt-ridden Hal to intentionally get himself kicked out of the Air Force by punching his commanding officer so he could speak to her. But he arrived too late and she died of cancer. Hal's brother Jack blamed him for driving her to an early grave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">That mistake</a> is the reason Hal got his job as a test pilot for Ferris Aircraft, since they were the only aviation company that would hire him after his dishonorable discharge.
</li><li> The Green Lantern's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">weakness to the color yellow</a> has long been the butt of jokes from comic book readers (and other superheroes) for its perceived silliness, and even <em>Green Lantern</em> fans long dismissed it as an artifact of the Silver Age. But the weakness didn't seem nearly as funny after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> finally revealed its origin in <em>Green Lantern: Rebirth</em>: it turns out that the "yellow impurity" in the Central Power Battery that caused the power ring's ineffectiveness against yellow objects was actually a malevolent alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> called "Parallax"—the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">living embodiment of fear</a>, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">imprisoned in the power battery</a> by the Guardians to stop it from enslaving the universe.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0m2tz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0m2tz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0m2tz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Parallax is yellow because the power of fear manifests as yellow energy; it's the antithesis of the green energy of willpower, which gives Green Lanterns their powers.</span> Parallax's mastery of fear was so great that it led to Hal Jordan's corruption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmeraldTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmeraldTwilight">Emerald Twilight</a></em>, which culminated in him rebelling against the Green Lantern Corps and successfully draining the Central Power Battery.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em>, there was a gag where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">Tap on the Head</a> would transform Guy Gardner from his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> personality to being all hearts and flowers (or vice versa).

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">supervillain brainwashing</a> plot arc which began in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em> used this trope in two ways:
<ul><li> Prior to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em> (and particularly during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a>), heroes used "mindwipes" and other forms of selective memory erasure <em>all the time</em>, frequently to preserve the heroes' secret identities. Ethical issues relating to this were seldom (if ever) addressed. Suddenly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em>, the ethics of mindwiping came to the forefront, and were revealed as the cause of a major past schism in the Justice League.
</li><li> In addition, several changes in certain supervillains' behavior were attributed to the effects of mindwiping. Most notably, this was used to explain how Dr. Light went from being a serious threat to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> Justice League to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">joke villain constantly bested by the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a> by revealing that he was given, not just a mindwipe, but a personality alteration after he brutally raped Sue Dibny in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em>.
</li><li> One of the most controversial revelations was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a>'s turn towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villainy</a> (and sometimes outright heroism) during her 2000s series was not the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, but rather a mindwipe and personality alteration dealt by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The first issue of the official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> continuation comic does this in regards to Zim's relationship with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket">Friend in the Black Market</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">Knowledge Broker</a>, Prisoner 777.

Initially introduced as a sexy, funny, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBondage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBondage">kinky</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>, once she starts getting stories centering around her it becomes increasingly obvious that she's an incredibly damaged but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">heartbreakingly, unjustifiedly, optimistic</a> woman who's been sexually and financially exploited and emotionally abused by just about everyone she's ever known except her sisters.
<ul><li> Jaime's half of the series also featured at least one major retcon of this type. Early stories of the Hoppers 13 (aka Locas) books were slightly campy, pulpy affairs, lending the "Rockets" to the "Love &amp; Rockets" title of the larger comic. These stories had Maggie interacting with aliens, dinosaurs, robots, rocketships, interplanetary travel, and hovercars, all occupying a fictional retrofuturist setting. Later stories eliminated the science fiction elements completely and shifted the settings to the real world. Later comics retconned the early stories by saying that Maggie's memories of that period had become muddled by LSD use and too many 1950's sci-fi comic books.
</li></ul></li><li> The long-forgotten <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a></em> mini-series <em>Conspiracy</em> implied that most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Million-to-One Chance</a>-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory">Origin Stories</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> were actually the work of a shadowy government cadre called "Control."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave">Nextwave</a></em> was insanely violent and nonsensical, utterly hilarious, and completely non-canon.

For one, Thing's dialogue strongly suggested that nobody had been killed, and the fight actually came to a peaceful resolution after Banner managed to regain control of himself. The story was even filled with humorous moments, such as civilians placing bets on who would win.

He ended up with Kim after some sort of altercation with a guy Kim was dating, Simon Lee (the circumstances aren't known, but Kim mentioned hugging and its implied it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>). Furthermore, he told his best friend Lisa Miller that he was moving to Toronto and asked her to tell Kim instead of him doing it himself, which led to Kim and Lisa not talking for a month. Though the incident with Simon was mentioned beforehand (Kim called Simon a jerk and called Scott one too, though half-heartedly with the latter). She later admitted it was partially her own fault for her reaction.

Depictions of Go Hibiki's death have been comical, showing how Dan is a stereotypical character with a generic backstory. In this comic... it's played completely straight. Go is brutally beaten to death by Sagat and Dan is left traumatized.

But when she's unhappy, the reverse is true for Belinda. So the only way for Belinda to feel actually, truly happy is if Linda is miserable. So naturally, Belinda tries as hard as she can to make that happen.

Even when the franchise is at its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darkest and Edgiest</a>, there's something inherently silly about seeing four giant turtles walking around a crowded city wearing nothing but tiny cloth scarves around their heads.

But as the film goes on, it gradually becomes clear that she's deeply bothered by her inability to hold onto memories, particularly since it means that she can't remember anything about her real family, and it makes it almost impossible for her to form lasting relationships. As much as she might annoy Marlin, she <em>does</em> deeply value him as a friend...since he's one of the few friends that she's ever had. It becomes even worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory">Finding Dory</a></em>, where it's revealed that her memory problems caused her to lose her family, that she outright catches anxiety when faced with the thought that she will be left all alone, with nobody to help her, that even her parents were worried about her future and so much more... The sequel also turns several of her personality quirks from the original film (such as the "just keep swimming" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>) and has them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>.

In the original movie, the song 'Do you wanna build a snowman' serves to represent Elsa and Anna drifting apart, showing how Anna comes to Elsa's door each year asking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">build a snowman</a> with her like they did at the beginning of the movie, but Elsa always refuses. In Olaf's Frozen Adventure, this is shown in a different light - the plot of the movie is Elsa being depressed that she and Anna never had any family traditions (largely because their parents died and Elsa became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShutIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShutIn">shut-in</a> and all), but in the latter half of the movie, they discover a box with several fake snowmen, made of paper or string, that Anna would sneak below Elsa's door when she would come by to ask about making snowmen. We see images of Elsa standing behind the door, wanting to say yes, but too scared to say anything. So in truth, those moments didn't mean they were drifting apart, necessarily, but rather showed that even in spite of everything, they were still thinking of each other. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments">They did indeed have a family tradition after all</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, Luke Skywalker's Aunt Beru notes to his Uncle Owen "Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.", to which Owen says "That's what I'm afraid of." In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, we learn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke's father is</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">in fact, Darth Vader</a>, one of the most evil men in the galaxy.

It goes from mere apprehension that Luke might get himself killed to fears that Luke might turn <em>genocidal</em>.
</li><li> There's also a comedic scene in <em>A New Hope</em> where Chewbacca refuses to go inside the chute to the Death Star's trash compactor because of the smell, and Han ends up having to kick him in. In the canonical <em>Star Wars: Chewbacca</em> mini-series from Marvel, we learn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claustrophobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Claustrophobia">tight, enclosed spaces</a> trigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaButton">traumatic flashbacks</a> to his time as a slave, making his unwillingness to go down the chute much more understandable.
</li><li> One of the things Darth Vader is best known for in the Original Trilogy is Force-choking anyone who angers him. This gets <em>very</em> tragic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, as the first person Anakin/Vader killed with the Force choke (albeit indirectly) was Padmé, the love of his life, which became <em>the</em> reason he joined the Dark Side.
</li><li> In <em>A New Hope</em>, the gunner of the Death Star says "Stand by" twice when he can destroy Yavin IV, giving Luke enough time to destroy the station before it destroyed the Rebel base. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em> shows that the gunner had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> after Alderaan, and that was his way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">put off firing long enough for the Death Star to be destroyed, knowing that he'd die in the process</a>.

Their resources were more of a plot point than they were; the only role <em>they</em> played was to leer menacingly and set up those things, then be killed quickly. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>, set earlier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston">Aaron Allston</a> made it a point to expand on those two, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a>, <em>very</em> intelligent, and quite essential to the plot. Their two-dimensional idiocy became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, and they actually turned into legitimate (and <em>very</em> entertaining) threats.
</li><li> In early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books, there are repeated references to the Battle of Koom Valley, a battle between trolls and dwarfs in which both sides claimed the other ambushed them, used as an illustration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and humorously over-the-top grudge-holding. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em>, it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the original Battle of Koom Valley was a tragic misunderstanding in which an attempted <em>peace talk</em> between dwarfs and trolls was interrupted by a flood, washing away the entire peace party. When the rest of the armies arrived late, because of the floods, they all assumed that the <em>other</em> side must have ambushed their leaders and murdered them, leading to centuries more war and hatred.</span>
</li><li> In the first book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FamiliasRegnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FamiliasRegnant">Familias Regnant</a></em> series, much of the light relief comes from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> character who is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a>. The second book features the revelation that this character used to be much more intelligent and with-it before an assassination attempt left him with brain damage, which leaves those bits a lot less comic in retrospect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hermione's attitude towards House Elves in the series was always treated as your average tree-hugging annoyance. Especially in regards to Kreacher as Sirius would crack sarcastic jokes about Kreacher obsessing over the family members' old belongings and even making death jokes about him which Harry and Ron openly laughed about. Then in the final book and we find out exactly what Kreacher has been through... Sirius's jokes and attitude don't seem so funny anymore.
</li><li> A more notable example would be the way a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher never stays on for more than a year, to the point where people joke about the position being cursed. Turns out, it is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Voldemort himself wanted the position many years ago, but Dumbledore refused to give it to him. (Obviously, this was before he became known as wizard-Hitler.) Ever since, no one has been able to hold the job for more than a year without something happening to them.</span>
</li><li> Neville Longbottom is bumbling and forgetful, and most of the other characters (especially Snape) tease him for his incompetence while his grandmother relentlessly pushes him. We later learn that Neville's parents were Aurors that were tortured into total insanity, a significant part of his bumbling lack of self-esteem is fear of not living up to their example, and his grandmother's nature was to toughen him up to protect him from the same fate.
</li><li> In <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>, Hagrid is presented as a goofy, over-sized character who is clumsy with his magic and hides his wand in an umbrella. This is presented as simple comic relief. It is later revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that Hagrid is a half-giant and has been suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> his whole life. He is clumsy with magic because he was framed for Tom Riddle murdering Moaning Myrtle, and was expelled from Hogwarts early in his education. Accordingly, he has to keep his wand in an umbrella not to maintain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>, but because he's not allowed to have a wand in the first place (and said wand was actually snapped into several pieces after his expulsion, which the umbrella somewhat rectifies).</span>
</li><li> An early chapter in <em>Philosopher's Stone</em> also shows Harry conversing with a snake at the zoo, which gets Dudley into trouble with his bumbling. At the time, the comical incident just seems to be a sign of Harry's magical abilities manifesting. <em>Chamber of Secrets</em> later reveals that the ability to speak in Parseltongue (the language of snakes) is actually a very rare ability among Wizards, and that it's one marker of the bloodline of the Salazar Slytherin—from whom Lord Voldemort is descended. Harry's ability to speak to snakes later becomes a sinister mark of his connection to Voldemort, and it foreshadows the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harry carries part of Voldemort's soul inside him</span>.
</li><li> Three about Dumbledore from <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>. One of the first things Harry notes about him is that his nose is crooked and has been broken before. He finds out in <em>Deathly Hallows</em> that his nose got broken at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his sister's funeral</span> by his own brother because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he caused her death</span> and never fixed it because he views it as a sort of embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">My Greatest Failure</a>. When he catches Harry looking at the Mirror of Erised right after Christmas, he tells Harry to not look at it again because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">too intoxicating</a>. Harry asks him what he sees in it and he tells him a pair of warm socks. Harry doesn't 100% buy it but lets it slide, he also finds out in the last book that he saw the same thing as Harry, the family he lost. The third is why he had James Potter's invisibility cloak when he died. Harry had just assumed it was to study it because it was so powerful. Turns out that it's tied to both of the aforementioned things,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's a Deathly Hallow</span> and he couldn't helped but be drawn back to his youthful obsession with them, even though his search for them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">got his sister killed</span>.
</li><li> A lot of characters seem to view love potions as a harmless joke (although, notably, Harry himself doesn't appear to share this attitude). Then it's revealed that Merope Gaunt spent months using them to mind-rape (and then just straight-up rape) Tom Riddle, leading to the birth of Voldemort.
</li><li> After her introduction in <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> Sybil Trelawney is treated almost entirely as comic relief, with the students and faculty of Hogwarts all dismissing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">constant gloomy prophecies</a> as nonsense. Not even Dumbledore seems to take her seriously, as he joins in on the snark-fest whenever she's not in earshot. But her prophecies seem a lot less funny after the end of <em>The Order of the Phoenix</em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Voldemort tried to kill Harry as an infant because Trelawney prophesied (rightly) that Harry was the only person in the world capable of defeating him, and that one of them was destined to kill the other. Dumbledore himself employs Trelawney at Howgwarts partially to protect her from Voldemort, as one of the few people who know about Trelawney's rare prophetic, trance-like episodes (that she herself is unaware of) inherited from her ancestor Cassandra</span>.
</li><li> In early books, the taboo against speaking Voldemort's name aloud is played for (slightly dark) laughs, because of the inherent ridiculousness of fully-grown adults collapsing into shivering fits at the mere mention of a Wizard's name—while the young Harry, who wasn't raised to fear Voldemort, can't understand what the big deal is. But in the seventh volume, we find out that there's actually a very good reason to be afraid of saying Voldemort's name: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tom Riddle placed a curse on the name "Voldemort" to keep tabs on his enemies, ensuring that his Death Eaters would be sent to dispatch anyone brave enough to speak his chosen name aloud</span>. After we learn that, the taboo is played for deadly serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a>.
</li><li> Hogwarts resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">ghosts</a> are initially presented as whimsical comic relief side characters who help drive home the school's fantastical nature; generally speaking, they're all quite jolly and easygoing, and they don't seem to have any angst about being dead. But as the series goes on, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a> of Death becomes more prominent, it can seem rather odd that the ghosts are treated so light-heartedly. Well, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, we learn that ghosts are actually regarded with great curiosity and scrutiny by Wizards, and that there's an entire secret department in the Ministry of Magic devoted to studying the mysteries of Death and the Afterlife. Nearly Headless Nick also outright states that becoming a ghost is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> chosen only by tormented wizards who are afraid—or unwilling—to face the Afterlife. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Sirius' death, a devastated Harry even asks Nick if he might come back as a ghost, and becomes even more distraught when he learns that he won't</span>. The idea grows another layer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">The Deathly Hallows</a></em>, when it's revealed that the Bloody Baron and the Grey Lady are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a pair of tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> who wound up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a> after the Bloody Baron killed her in a fit of rage, and later committed suicide</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Million-to-One Chance</a> produced when Arthur Dent accidentally activates the Infinite Improbability Drive causes two missiles to be transformed into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias, which fall onto the surface of an alien planet. While the whale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">contemplates its brief existence</a> at some length before its demise, all that the bowl of petunias thinks is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain">"Oh no, not again."</a> This thought is left unexplained, with the comment: "If we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now." The bowl of petunias, however, is dismayingly explained in <em>Life, the Universe, and Everything</em> as being one of many incarnations through time and space of a creature called Agrajag, whom Arthur Dent has accidentally killed in each form (also counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R.

Bilbo recovers a magic ring from Gollum's cave after winning a riddle contest. While the original story did make it plain that Bilbo was riddling for his life, the ring he retrieves is later treated as a precious prize, saving his life several times and leading to his happy ending. Years later, when it was time to release <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Tolkien retconned the story (actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReWrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReWrite">rewriting</a></em> <em>The Hobbit</em>) to tie in with the nature of the Ring as a malicious artifact made of pure evil that was using Bilbo to escape Gollum's ownership. The existence of the first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> was even deconstructed: it records <em>Bilbo's lies</em> about how he got the Ring and what it was like.

They had to climb their way to release, which brings about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> by itself considering that Blackbeard's pirate crew are all adult males surrounding two females, one of whom is about <em>10-year-old</em>...you get the clue.

</li><li> Similarly, we have Saul's freak-out during Jesse and Walt's plan to scare him in Saul's introductory episode, "Better Call Saul", once you take "Mijo" into account. What at first seems like Saul simply fearing for his life turns into Jimmy thinking Tuco's men have decided to finally kill him. Especially after he says that whatever they think he did, <em>Ignacio</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka.

<ul><li> Sheldon has a habit of knocking on a door three times before he enters a room. This stays funny until "The Hot Tub Comtamination", where he tells Penny that he does this so that the people on the other side could get dressed in case they were doing amorous activities. This is due to a time when he came home early as a teen and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalScene">walked in on his father having sex</a> with someone else behind his mother's back.
</li><li> Raj's inability to speak to women was originally attributed to Raj just being shy around pretty girls and there were a couple of occasions where he spoke to the guys while Penny was in the room. Later on, Leonard's mother diagnosed Raj with selective mutism and he not only couldn't speak to any woman who wasn't his mother or sister, he couldn't speak if a woman was present in the room at all (the sole exception being if he's speaking to a large audience that includes women). Raj's method of getting around this was by drinking alcohol or taking medication, neither being suitable long-term solutions and often bringing out his less-than-pleasant traits. If he wanted to speak when sober and a woman was present, he'd have to whisper what he wanted to say to one of the guys (usually Howard) and hope they'd repeat it. It also stopped being played as a joke after a while and was portrayed as a serious issue (among many) he had to overcome <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which he did in the season six finale</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Though not a comedy, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> managed this. Booth's increasing tendency to receive advice from famous people during dreams turns out to be caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a brain tumor that's slowly killing him</span>.

Once he became one of the regular cast of <em>Angel</em> his character was fleshed out enough to reveal that his early awkwardness was largely the result of a painful childhood with an abusive father; throughout the series any mention of his father causes Wesley to momentarily revert back to his old bumbling. His father's visit in "Lineage" is an especially dark example.

</li><li> Before "Remembrance of the Daleks" aired, fans constantly made jokes about how the Daleks' greatest weakness was stairs, as the way they were constructed pretty much prevented them from climbing up the stairs. The cliffhanger of "Remembrance of the Daleks" involves the Seventh Doctor being stuck in between a locked door at the top of a stairway, and a Dalek that is levitating upwards towards him. This was re-introduced in Series 1 in 2005 when a Dalek was mocked for not being able to climb up the stairs, only to proceed to levitate up the stairs.
</li><li> In "Closing Time", it's revealed the Doctor can 'speak baby', and characterises the baby in question as a megalomaniac that addresses itself as 'Stormageddon', all played for laughs. In "The Girl Who Died", two series later, the Doctor translates a baby's speech in a much more haunting and poetic manner that is played as an otherworldly, beautiful moment.
</li><li> In "Under the Lake", there is a gag where Clara keeps cue cards to help the Doctor out in difficult social situations. When the cards show up again in "Face The Raven" it's played as a dramatic moment, with Clara and the Doctor picking through cards together while Rigsy looks on, anticipating hearing something terrible (which, of course, is exactly what happens).

The writers liked the idea of an invisible Scorpius acting as the devil on Crichton's shoulder so much, they retconned things so that the hallucination was actually due to a neural-chip implanted by Scorpius in a previous episode, eventually dubbed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Harvey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Harvey">Harvey</a>".
</li><li> The French Canadian series 'La princesse Astronaute' (The Astronaut Princess), is, most of the time, a fun and lighthearted family tv program about a princess living a fantasy medieval world where, every once in a while, objects from modern day Earth fall from the sky (the people call it a heavy rain). The princess, Noemi, got the idea to become an astronaut from an old magazine she found during such a rain. While they acknowledge the rains are dangerous (Noemi's mother was killed when a washing machine fell on her), they are usually treated as comedy, with the characters finding every day object and not understanding their use. Come the end of the third season, Noemi makes her way to our moon, guided by mysterious black boxes scattered around the galaxy. The final black box she finds on the moon had this message, written by humans: "We are capable of the very best and the very worst. We have reached for the moon, yet may now destroy our own planet. Too many people, too much pollution, too much junk. Our best will save us, or our worst will destroy us. Anyone, please, help us."

That is, until Volume 4 rolls around. In the episode 1961, we learn that Angela had a sister who she left when she was a child, regretting it ever since. We also learn that whenever she finds herself missing her sister particularly badly, she, you guessed it, steals socks. Suddenly, that lighthearted moment in the series premier seems a lot more disturbing.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>
<ul><li> In the original game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em>, Snake looked to be in his twenties - but he looked to be late-middle-aged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>. For the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, the character designer decided to go with a Solid Snake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">who appeared to be in his early-thirties</a>, younger-looking than his previous incarnation. As a joke referencing this, the characters who knew Snake in <em>Metal Gear 2</em> joke about his "age"; the sign that Gray Fox is back to normal is when he teases Snake with the throwaway line <em>"You haven't aged well"</em>. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em>, which started the Patriots plot arc, Snake is explicitly mentioned in the script as looking almost unrecognisably older than his self in <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, even though <em>MGS2</em> starts only two years later. Liquid spells it out:
<div class="indent"><em>"You're drowning in time! I know what it's like, Brother. Few more years and you'll be another dead clone of the old man!"</em>
</div></li><li> And it continues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>. The reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp">Plot-Relevant Age-Up</a> was changed to fit in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcons</a> introduced in the third game, but becomes entirely horrible. Snake now appears to be in his mid-to-late seventies and his health is suffering as a result. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His own parents</span> look younger than he does. It's very alarming to remember that the whole plot element started as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> joke.
</li><li> Applying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> to <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</em> allowed their eight-bit wackiness to be taken fairly seriously in the <em>Solid</em> series. Snake didn't seem that affected by the events of Outer Heaven at the time (he also had to do things like avoid giant constantly moving rolling pins and use a bomb blast suit to make himself immune to a strong wind), and <em>Metal Gear 2</em> attempted to paint him as a very traditional action hero who retired after Outer Heaven because he was a loose cannon and too badass to take orders from authority. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> counterpart, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel">Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</a></em>, claimed that Snake suffered immense guilt over his actions in Outer Heaven, got diagnosed with PTSD, and was forced to retire and go into hiding because he was unable to cope with the demands of everyday life.
</li><li> One scene in <em>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</em> involved Snake knowing a woman for all of five minutes. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto">tells him about her family's history</a>, asks him about his (he says "I have no family"), and then she dies. Snake's over-the-top grief at her death was, at the time, a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>. In <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, which established that Snake had been essentially growing up in near-total isolation and had never had anyone tell him about their life or ask him about his own, his instant attachment to her seems very justifiable and deeply tragic.
</li><li> The reason why The Patriot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, a copy of The Boss's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>, has infinite ammo, is that it has an infinity-symbol shaped drum magazine, giving infinite ammo. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>, it's explained that the Patriot has infinite ammo because <em>"they say The Boss left a part of her soul behind inside it"</em>, making it more into a blessed memento of a supernaturally-gifted soldier rather than a cheap joke. It winds up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a> though, as the infinite ammo is explicitly noted about it before this could have happened. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You only get the Patriot after you have killed The Boss, but when talking about it Snake had not yet killed his mentor, and the method that Snake gets it is lampshaded for being dubious. He isn't even supposed to have it until after he kills The Boss</span>.

This may be the reason why Mega Evolved Pokémon don't stay Mega Evolved indefinitely.
</li><li> Pokedex entries in the <em>Pokémon</em> games often feature elements about the power of the Pokémon in question, many of which have gross violations of physics, biology or gameplay (Magcargo's body is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit or all the many tales of ghost type and psychic type Pokémon having supernatural abilities). The <em>Sun and Moon</em> Pokedex entries are much darker and more realistic about the Pokémon's strengths, abilities and appearances (such as Bewear being so strong that it has killed trainers or Glailie dislocating its jaw when it mega evolves).
</li><li> Some Pokémon from previous generations are put in a new, and dark, light. The perpetually angry Mankey and Primeape from Gen 1, for example, were revealed to suffer constant loneliness both as a cause and result of their never ending uncontrollable anger, and they never get rest from it; they are woken up constantly because of it when sleeping. It only gets peace in death, which is often caused by getting so extremely angry its body shuts down.

</li><li> Pointedly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy">Casey and Andy</a></em>: despite the comic having several dramatic storylines, the strip never gives any sort of explanation, serious or otherwise, as to why the protagonists can keep coming back from the dead. Especially when other characters come right out and ask for one. (In fact, the title characters never even acknowledge any such thing has happened).

</li><li> Dave isn't exempt either. Early on, it's mentioned in a throwaway gag that he's deathly allergic to bee stings. Years later, in the <em>Adversary</em> storyline (which is pretty much solely responsible for tossing the comic into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> territory), as he and Margaret are running away from the Devil, they find that their path leads through a field of sunflowers... and bees.
</li></ul></li><li> A mild example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a></em>: a fairly early filler strip joked about various ways the comic could get more hits, including having a character coming out of the closet and introducing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Boys' Love</a> story.

<ul><li> The comic constantly parodies the hero-vs-overlord formula with goofy heroes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">Surrounded by Idiots</a> villains. Then we see how much collateral damage can be taken when various 'demon overlords' try to acquire as much power as possible while ignorant or apathetic of the consequences. Dark Pegasus accidentally made a race of funny family-friendly undead, and then tried to make up for the humiliation by <em>magically draining the life from H'Ann farm by farm</em>, and he partially succeeded. Dan's grandmother <em>accidentally devoured the souls of her own family and started a genocidal war</em>... and she's the <em>sympathetic</em> one, because the dragon she usurped devoured the souls of his entire city for centuries.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Exiern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Exiern">Exiern</a></em> has been going through a series of these, converting it from the original author's lighthearted fan-servicey gender-bender to something a lot grimmer.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Goblins">Goblins</a></em> did this in a big way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> suggests that the apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> was intentional almost from the word go — this is supported by some bonus material in the PDF release of book one — the early farcical jokey stuff was originally written much earlier (with Kobolds), and apparently rewritten as an introduction to the story as it is today. However, it is noticeable that the comic has gotten significantly less jokey since its inception...
<ul><li> What was a farcical joke about how goblins inevitably receive appropriate names from the village seer became this huge plot point about the female goblin Saves-a-Fox who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">successfully struggled against the name given to her</a> by killing said fox rather than saving it. It bears noting that she has saved the fox's pelt, even through being captured and held as a labor-slave by another tribe of goblins. Regarding Saves, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that the fox likely had a horrific disease and if so, she actually did "save" it by giving it a mercy killing.</span>
</li><li> The joke about how Chief was only the chief because he was named "Chief" was retconned, with Complains explaining to Chief that he only said that as a cruel joke, while Chief becoming actual leader was to avert a nasty prophecy.
</li><li> Several of those early strips involved an outlandishly panicked coward very nearly dying horribly due to mishap caused by the carelessness of the other goblins, the joke being that the outlandishly panicked coward was, in fact, named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">"Dies Horribly"</a>. Dies went on to become a semi-regular character and was the one to make the above-spoilered reveal to Saves-a-Fox. When he does this, he is <em>also</em> stating and quite clearly that this joke was <em>never</em> a joke and that Dies Horribly <em>is</em> going to die. <strong>Horribly.</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He actually does die horribly, but it's not as big of a deal as it would seem since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">came back</a>. So, he both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Died Horribly</a> and is Horrible at Dying, since he keeps failing at it... </span>

<ul><li> The Goo started out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a>, but returned in the "Sister" arc, revealed to be driven by a device sent by Tedd's alternate-dimension counterpart to kill him.
</li><li> Furthermore, a gag character, the Demonic Duck, originally appeared as a one-shot gag when people would need a distraction and then point out his appearance, the joke being that the duck actually being there was far more ridiculous than someone using such a specific distraction. The duck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp">turns out to be</a> an <em>actual character with dramatic effects on the plot</em> later.
</li><li> Not to mention the Hammerchlorians storyline — a simple, running joke gone supernova. Not only did he explain the joke (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> reference, anyone?), but he wound up putting an immortal, extremely powerful entity in a main character's debt, and giving her new spells and an angst-splosion to boot.
</li><li> There are a lot of subtle examples of this in <em>EGS</em> as it moved from a wacky tone to a more serious one. A simple example is Sarah wearing a beret as part of a visual gag early on, and then a later strip showing a serious explanation on how she got that beret.
</li><li> When Tedd's fondness for transforming into a woman starts being used to explore actual gender issues we get a flashback to his dad's reaction ... and in this context Mr Verres's grumpy attitude looks <em>very</em> different and it seems like his mother leaving isn't the only reason Tedd's got anxiety problems.
</li><li> Sister 3 has one for the PTTAOLUTASF in Sister 1. Originally the protagonists are able to infiltrate it with ease because it had a very, very low security budget. (An upper floor window not having a covering.) In Sister 3 it's revealed to be a mousetrap of sorts, meant to distract from a much more important secret facility. The poor security is a ruse used to fool thieves into thinking it's an easy job, with the real security system only activating if they do something to the guard or try to actively take something out of the building.

Dave's got the PTSD triggers to show for it, too, such as a severe reaction to the sight of blood.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>It's All Been Done Before</em>, the entire comic was this trope. What started off as a light-hearted series of adventures of a man, his girlfriend, and their various animated toys, turned out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man refusing to put away his dead wife's toys on the day of her funeral</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LifeOfRiley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LifeOfRiley">Life of Riley</a></em>. What begins as a cheap throwaway joke about an artist who powers up a la DBZ when he works on computers, ends with same character resurrected as the second coming of the Messiah about to go toe-to-toe with arch-fiend Lillith over an artifact that can <em>kill God</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LookingForGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LookingForGroup">Looking for Group</a></em> started with the heroic Cale'anon meeting up with Richard, a lighthearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, who decides to travel with the empty-headed do-gooder because it'll be fun. Except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">now it turns out he's on a mission to protect Cale, under orders from Cale's former master — who, right after sending him into the world, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">killed his wife in cold blood</a></em> so he'd have nothing to come home to.</span>
</li><li> One of the earliest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/MegaTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/MegaTokyo">MegaTokyo</a></em> strips has Largo being fluent in l33t as a one-off gag. Later on, l33t becomes the official third language of the series.
</li><li> The role of henchmen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nodwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nodwick">Nodwick</a></em> — though their inability to permanently die is still played for laughs in the later books, there's a good deal more attention paid to why things are that way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> is chock full of throwaway jokes whose darker implications are fully explored later on. Some examples:
<ul><li> Done when Haley's greed for treasure is revealed to be so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she can pay her father's ransom money.</span> Later subverted when it turns out she was always pretty greedy in the prequel book. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the subversion was deliberately intended to avoid it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Funny Aneurysm" Moment</a>.
</li><li> A straighter example was done with the mother of the Black Dragon from the Starmetal cave, who was mentioned lightheartedly several times during the encounter in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vaarsuvius disintegrated her son in a scene that was still more or less played for laughs. About three hundred strips later, she appears out of the blue seeking vengeance on Vaarsuvius. This leads to one of the darkest arcs the strip has done thus far and the start of a horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>.</span>
</li><li> Blackwing's appearance and disappearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> at first in parody of D&amp;D players' tendency to ignore the existence of familiars except for when they are needed, later becomes a serious commentary on how Vaarsuvius treats other beings, and becomes a method by which to demonstrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.
</li><li> Most of the first arc was written without an overarching plot in mind, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a> of a party of adventurers clearing a dungeon to defeat an evil sorcerer lich. Notably, the dungeon is full of goblin mooks, who are treated as disposable by everyone, including the protagonists. Needless to say, later plot developments, especially the prequel book <em>Start of Darkness</em>, put a much darker spin on this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goblins and other monster races were <em>deliberately created</em> by the gods for the sole purpose of giving XP to adventurers, more specifically their own clerics. Their leader Redcloak — supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> of the story — is in fact <em>horrified</em> by everyone, including his master Xykon, needlessly throwing away goblin lives, and his secret plan is to blackmail the gods into giving his race fairer living conditions.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">deliberately terrible</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerupComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerupComics">Powerup Comics</a></em>, many punchlines involve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> Dorkwinkle getting shot in the head, only for him to reappear in later strips without a scratch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">and without any explanation</a>. Later, the comic gains pretensions of having an overarching story, and Dorkwinkle is explained as a genetic experiment who actually possesses the ability to recover from fatal injuries (although dying and recovering still hurts like hell).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em>
<ul><li> Faye getting drunk starts out as just an excuse for her to talk with a Southern accent and engage in wacky hijinks, but it later becomes a plot point that she's an alcoholic due to trauma in her past.
</li><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Hannelore's</a> rather unusual quirkiness and OCD in her early appearances are <a class="urllink" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2134">explained<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="urllink" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2147">much later comics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as being an incredible <em>improvement</em> over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her near paralytic insanity during her early childhood.</span>

As the story progresses, however, Hannu starts to suffer incapacitating headaches and fatigue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once the final stage has been completed, Puppy Fox reveals that these symptoms are an echo from the physical world. Hannu's fall just before entering the Spirit World inflicted a fatal skull fracture, and only Puppy Fox's spell has kept his body alive long enough to finish the quest.</span>
</li><li> Fuzzy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SamAndFuzzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SamAndFuzzy">Sam &amp; Fuzzy</a></em> is a mysterious bear-sized humanoid that nobody seemed to find mysterious at all, and his past was a complete unknown full of contradictions. Then, in book four, we learn that it's a literal unknown since his mind was erased and he's been making it all up to cover up for insecurities about who he really was. We also learn there's a world-wide conspiracy enforcing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> by confining the full level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEris">Planet Eris</a> to underground habitats and Fuzzy was one of the lucky few who slipped the net.
<ul><li> Fridge is very funny when he's a loud-mouthed possessed fridge who claims he won't escape by possessing Sam or Fuzzy because he's got standards. He gets less funny when he finally manages to escape, and sets in motion events that the main characters are still feeling the effects of over ten years later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em>
<ul><li> The protagonists discover at one point that before dying their old company doctor created a modified cryogenic kit capable of providing illegal and extreme modifications and performing far more powerful reconstructive surgery than a normal kit should. Initially this is just an excuse to solve the fact that almost the entire main cast were reduced to heads in jars at that moment, but later they run into a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bounty hunter hunting down said doctor</span> and we discover that a massive government conspiracy is built around <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Project Laz-R-Us" and the attempt to make humans effectively immortal</span>, and certain government agents who discover that the protagonists know about it want them dead.
</li><li> Something similar happens with Petey, initially a high-level warship A.I. with issues about ghosts. Eventually, he becomes a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nigh-omnipotent nascent A.I. god</span> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fusing with virtually every other A.I. in the galaxy</span> in a bid to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prevent the galaxy's annihilation</span>, and then sets out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">subvert and dominate every other galactic power</span> to build a power base big enough to fund and supply a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">genocidal assault on the Andromeda galaxy</span> and its Paan'uri inhabitants.

</li><li> Schlock starts as a huge pile of shit with two mismatched eyes. Then he loses his eyes to diamond beetles and hires Tagon to find his home planet to get a new pair. And we find the amorph with mismatched eyes is quite famous there. He got his eyes from his "parents" who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Danced</a> each other to death. Schlock is just the residue, with much of their knowledge and skills, but little to no morals, feared and hated by his fellow tribesmen. To further complicate things, normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> merges enemies' personalities and such "wars" end up uniting tribes, but his "father" used a modified technique, which absorbed just the enemies' bodies and expunged personalities, and "mother" tried to stop the murderous psycho, even with her life; yet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the former was a lonely hero fighting the slavers selling amorph slaves off-world and the latter was the slavers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a></span>. Still, this being an early storyline, everything is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.
</li><li> Another point about Schlock came around 2014. He spent a decade and half being beaten, frozen, exploded, sliced and partially burned, and didn't seem any worse for wear. Then a newcomer mentioned that since amorphs are effectively nothing but the carbosilicate equivalent of nerve tissue, all the damage to Schlock is like brain damage. Which would explain his sociopatic quirks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked">Shortpacked!</a></em>, Robin was the wacky comic-relief character, and her "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">hijinks</a>" generally played out that way. Even her treatment of Leslie was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, and since Leslie was (if you'll excuse the term) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Woman</a>, her annoyance was part of the joke. (Exception: the Jake Manley event, but they even managed to bounce back from that.) In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DumbingOfAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DumbingOfAge">Dumbing of Age</a></em>, Robin has much the same character beats as before, including the whole "My Lesbian" business, and because <em>DoA</em> is a less wacky setting, she's clearly a self-deluded and potentially dangerous narcissist and her attachment to Leslie is deeply toxic. It's hard to see the <em>Shortpacked!</em> Robin (who ends up getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a> ending with Leslie) in the same light after this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em>
<ul><li> Riff, an amateur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> and "freelance bum", routinely invents pieces of advanced technology such as dimensional portals, giant robots, and ray guns. Originally there was little mention of where he got the materials to build these devices, even though he seemed to have no source of income. However, in a later story arc, Riff reveals that he was actually a freelance inventor for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villainous Hereti Corporation</span>, who gave him a salary and a sizable expense account in exchange for the blueprints to all his inventions. After Riff <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rebelled against Hereti Corp</span>, he lost access to their resources. While he still creates ridiculously powerful and dangerous devices, he hasn't been able to do so nearly as frequently after the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dangerous Days</span> arc, and (much to his horror) has had to get a regular job in order to pay the bills. He still bemoans the fact that he can't afford as much cool stuff as he used to, wailing, "I used to have a budget!"
</li><li> Similarly, in the early "vampire" story arc, one of Valerie's vampire compatriots asks her why she has a crush on Torg, upon which she has a flashback to her pre-vampirism husband, a double of Torg, accidentally impaling himself on his own lance. Cue the Stormbreaker Saga, when Torg is stranded in the Dark Ages and his attempts to save Valerie from becoming a vampire are played for drama. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, after Torg goes back to the present, Valerie's husband dies in the accident, and it is revealed that this tragedy made her decide to join the vampire circle.</span> Also retconned the accident from being the clumsy mistake expected of Torg to the result of recovery from a debilitating curse, in a character who was otherwise a competent warlord.
</li><li> Done intentionally — as in, planned from the start — in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">"bROKEN"</a>, a chapter summarised in the archives as "terrible things happen". Torg has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticDream">Prophetic Dream</a> in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Oasis</a> says she wants to show him some dead baby birds she... (significant pause) "found" and has put inside an open grave. This is the same Oasis who Torg is constantly afraid will kill his friends because of her paranoid delusions. Torg looks into the grave and says "These aren't baby birds. It's..." The answer turns out to be "fried chicken", and Torg awakens to Zoë offering her some. He reflects that the dream turned out well after all, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the climax of the chapter, Oasis burns someone alive.</span>

In the "Consequences" arc, though, Anne is horrified that she screwed up so many lives. When Ming-mei remembers being transformed, she is clearly terrified and while the cheerleaders are more or less happy as girls, the webcomic <em>Cheer</em> shows that Jo still is driven to tears at one point when she realizes that no-one remembers anything good about their past selves. Cassie's love potions would also fit, starting as a running gag and ending with her realizing that she had selfishly been trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> someone into loving her. Same with Miranda West, who first appears to be an annoying mentor, but gradually shows signs of being more sinister.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Yosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Yosh">Yosh!</a></em>
<ul><li> It started out as a manga-style comedy, and the protagonist was frequently subjected to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Megaton Punch</a>, thrown out of windows, things like that. Then, once the comic went dramatic, it was revealed that he's a "Resistant" — a kind of rare, magical entity who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a> — thus making him central to the plot of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> of mages. Upon learning that, the character comments that it's not really a major surprise, considering what he's survived in the past.
</li><li> Also, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girl</a> roommate was a normal girl that got mutated during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin">The Weirding,</a> turning her into a chimera and made her life a living hell.

</li><li> In that same vein, the spell originally used to banish Lord Incubus way back in the comic's wacky beginning (before the genesis of the title Zebra Girl, even) has a slightly less humorous feel now that it's been used on the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">former protagonist</span> who is far more frightening than Lord Incubus ever was. Although, the spell still appears in the form of a magical toilet that sucks the unwanted guest in.

</li><li> The backstory for his Magic Gun could have been an example of the trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">if not for that fact that he had always planned on giving the gun a dark backstory</a>.
</li><li> His bouts of amorality throughout the series received this treatment at the end of his "Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham" review when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after a long journey to find a famous Wizard in order to discover why his Magic Gun no longer works, the Wizard proceeds to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, outlining (with clips from the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Kickassia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Kickassia">Kickassia</a>, and the crossovers with other reviewers) how Linkara hasn't been acting like a hero at <em>all</em>.</span>

One episode later, and it was Rebecca's sexually abusive history that made her want to take control back, and Karl lost his wife and family when the wall fell.
</li><li> Danny Sexbang of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps">Game Grumps</a></em> has repeatedly told stories about being in France as an exchange student of sorts, but it wasn't revealed until episode 19 of their <em>Wind Waker</em> playthrough that he went to France as a part of coping with his depression/OCD.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://bobthedalek.deviantart.com">Bob the Dalek<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> usually draws <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> comics featuring Octavia's mother (called Octamum), who has a habit of treating Vinyl Scratch like a baby - making her wear a bonnet and booties, giving her a bottle, etc. Then, in <a class="urllink" href="http://bobthedalek.deviantart.com/art/Revelations-411652481">this comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Vinyl asks her point blank why, if she wants another foal so badly, she doesn't just have another one with her husband...and Octamum reveals that she suffers from <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which makes it almost impossible for you to have children.
</li><li> Not quite so harsh, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> used to be proud of how he and his generation got raised by television. But as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> became more and more clear, the pride turned bitter and "raising your kids on TV" is now one of the many things movie parents do wrong in his eyes.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">The Spoony Experiment</a></em>, it's hinted that the real "experiment" at work is on Spoony himself... and he isn't even aware it's happening.
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/portraits-of-your-father">Portraits Of Your Father<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> recasts Dr. Kondraki, everyone's favorite 682-riding foolhardy genius, as a severely bipolar man who stopped taking his mood stabilizers after a divorce and became an alcoholic. This makes his most (in)famous stunts the results of extreme mania highs. The effects this has on his son are then explored in detail.
<ul><li> Similarly, Dr. Bright, the doctor famous the list of things he's not allowed to do at the Foundation, is shown to have a VERY dark history, over the course of such tales as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-circuits-dead-theres-something-wrong">Major Tom<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/codebrown">Code Brown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's not just him, it's his entire family who's been royally screwed over as a result of anomalies.
</li><li> Dr. Clef, the third of the three "crazy wacky cool doctors" alongside Kondraki and Bright, has it just as bad. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4231">SCP-4231<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is not only his origin story, but also the origin story of SCP-166, 231, and 2317. Clef used to be a GOC agent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> involved in the attempted genocide of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Type Greens</a>, including children. And he was and is a Type Green himself. That's just the start of it. His girlfriend, Lilly (another Type Green), was extremely abusive and outright raped him at least once; SCP-166 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a> of him by Lilly. Ultimately, between the sheer stress of a horrifically abusive relationship for years, being a closeted Type Green conducting a genocide of other Type Greens, and wanting to protect his child, he killed Lilly just after she gave birth. A side effect of this was their combined reality warping and trauma leading to a boiling flood that wiped out the entire town of North Access. When the Foundation stepped in afterward they acted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a> towards him, already in an even worse state than usual, until he eventually used his reality warping to force them to meet his requests.</span> Just to make it worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilly</span> was a fanatical worshipper of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Scarlet King</a> who created SCP-231 and 2317, and it's implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clef himself is an active instance of SCP-231. That makes Procedure 110-Montauk pointless.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> There's a whole category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyPasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyPasta">Creepypasta</a> regarding supposed dark secrets of light-hearted children's shows and games, e.g. that an actor was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>, that the show was being used to summon an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, or that <em>the show itself</em> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.
</li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/URealmsLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/URealmsLive">U Realms Live</a></em>, in the Azveltara Z campaign, the players and characters continuously make jokes about the number 77 throughout the duration of the campaign. Two campaigns later, in the prequel campaign titled Lyn Azveltara Gaiden, it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">77 is the number of miscarriages Lyn Azveltara had prior to both campaigns</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Back in season 1, there is a one off flashback gag where Joey is trying to "teach" Serenity how to drive. In Episode 54, however, it turns out said incident was actually the cause of Noah's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">untimely death</a>".
</li><li> When Dartz and his men first appeared in the <em>Marik's Evil Council</em> spin-off, Rafael was portrayed as unable to say anything but "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft">Zog-Zog</a>", until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">later episodes had him inexplicably drop this</a> to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>. Similarly, Alister was given a ridiculously high-speech voice, which also was treated for comedy. When the Abridged Series reached Season 5 (where they were the main antagonists), it was revealed Rafael's earlier inability to speak properly was due to him being trapped on a deserted island for years to the point he had forgotten how to speak English, and it took him a long while to recover. And Alister's voice was the result of him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">having his testicles damaged</a> in an explosion that also killed his brother.
