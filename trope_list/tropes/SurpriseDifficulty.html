This trope is when you just don't expect a game to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>. You'd expect a shooter with robots spraying machine gun fire to be difficult, but a game with fairies shooting spells at you from their wands can still hand your ass to you.
</p><p>Difficult games can be <em>anywhere</em>, in any genre. Of course this is YMMV, but the fact of the matter is that difficult games don't exactly have any kind of official way to mark themselves, so they can show up when we least expect them. As these examples show, woe betide those who judge a game by surface "cuteness".
</p><p>When occurring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">licensed games</a> based on children's series, chances are that you expected the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> to be applied to them. Often goes hand-in-hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance">Art-Style Dissonance</a>, as people often expect a "cute" game to be non-challenging, both in mechanics and in plot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay">Unexpectedly Realistic Gameplay</a> is also related, as part of the difficulty may stem from the fact that the game avoids certain conventional simplifications and shortcuts found in other games of the same genre that players have come to expect by default.

<ul><li> How hard would you expect a shooter starring a cute little yellow <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienHominid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienHominid">Alien Hominid</a></em> to be? Well, if you know the inspiration was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em>, that should answer <em>all</em> your questions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead">Cuphead</a></em> has a 1930d cartoons aesthetic with cute and silly cartoon characters. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteEmUp">Cute 'em Up</a> run-and-gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame">Boss Game</a> inspired by the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius">Parodius</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em>, where you get (by default) only three hits, no opportunities to replenish health mid-level, and no checkpoints. You <em>will</em> be struggling to beat bosses as early as Hilda Berg, but you are guaranteed to be pulling your hair out against any of the first three available bosses of <em>the second world</em>.
</li><li> To some extent, most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Treasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Treasure">Treasure</a>'s output falls under this. With their whimsical art style and characters, you might not expect (for instance) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy">Dynamite Headdy</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers">Mischief Makers</a></em> to be as hard as they are.
</li><li> <em>Noah's Ark</em>, one of the few Bible games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> doesn't think outright sucks, is actually insanely difficult, despite its cutesy graphics and, well, status as a Bible game, especially chapter 4. Of course, it's made by the same people who made Contra. But pressing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">up up down down etc.</a> on the title screen does nothing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em>, for the time. Now this game is famous for its difficulty alone, but back then, when the reputation wasn't so widespread yet, you didn't expect a game that had two cute frogs with ridiculously cartoony special moves and colorful stages to be hard.
</li><li> Hmm, a third-person actioner/shooter/platformer called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkenedSkye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkenedSkye">Darkened Skye</a></em>. Involving Skittles, you say? Probably finish it in an hour. Wow, why am I dying so much? These jumps, especially involving those freakin' sinking lily pads, are HARD, and the enemies are really good shots! What, there are puzzles too?!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em> may have inflicted the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em> cast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super Deformities</a>, but the difficulty department definitely doesn't slack off, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> for New Style mode <em>requires</em> you not only to complete every stage on every difficulty, but <em>also</em> to use every character for each of these difficulties, even characters who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">clearly aren't suited for certain stages at all</a>. And hey, the original NES levels are available for you to tackle too, and they're all in Old Style mode...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flicky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flicky">Flicky</a></em> is about a cute mother bluebird trying to save her chicks from hungry cats and iguanas that want to eat them. The levels are only as big as the screen, and are very brightly colored. The chicks don't actually die if the aforementioned enemies get to them (unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZombiesAteMyNeighbors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZombiesAteMyNeighbors">Zombies Ate My Neighbors</a></em>)...but Flicky does if she touches a cat, and the cats like to ambush her. And the iguanas can run along any surface at about the same speed as Flicky can run. Flicky can't fly, only jump high. Your only defenses are apples, telephones, cups, and other objects which Flicky can pick up by touching them and throw...but they use the same button as jumping. And there are only so many throwable objects per level. And due to the aforementioned issue, you're likely to waste a lot of them while frantically guiding the chicks to the exit. And the cats and iguanas come back after about 7 seconds even if you do manage to kill them by throwing stuff at them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty">Copy Kitty</a></em>: A bright and lighthearted game about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girl</a> destroying adorable and strange robots in a VR program with tons and tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUP">Stuff Blowing UP</a>. The titular copy abilities give you incredibly explosive and overpowered weapons to play with, causing screen-filling lasers, homing rockets that explode on contact, several weapons that smash walls and enemies alike, the list goes on. And you will need every one of these weapons to get through levels custom-made to take advantage of their limitations and properties, with bosses that can tear the little kitty to pieces if you don't memorize their patterns well. The unlockable Hard Mode takes everything the game's taught you up to this point and puts it all to the test with levels filled with so many explosions and swarms of more powerful robots you'll wonder how you're supposed to fend them off. And the bosses...are some of the most difficult this side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Treasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Treasure">Treasure</a> with the creators citing them as a heavy influence.

<ul><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> game is surprisingly hard to anyone who came to the series by its sequels. You probably heard the second game is the hardest of the series, but the first game can be a surprise since its difficulty is not discussed as often. Most of the difficulty comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox">lack of clarity of objectives</a>, with no clear storyline or progression path and many dungeons and important items hidden in totally random places. Players were supposed to work together to figure out where to go, because scouting it all out on your own would take ages.
<ul><li> Eiji Aonuma, who is one of THE most important people in the making of the <em>Zelda</em> series, has never beaten the first game.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>, since, unlike the sequels (and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">enhanced remake</a>), there is no map, you can't shoot kneeling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments">all the rooms look the same</a>, and when you continue you only have 30 health no matter how many energy tanks you have.
<ul><li> While not as difficult as the original <em>Metroid</em>, those who went from the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike">were shocked by an utterly unforgiving game</a> with large worlds, few save points and some notoriously difficult boss fights such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">The Boost Guardian, The Spiderball Guardian</a> and others, and finally a second dimension that hurt Samus when she went into it. You fight almost all of the bosses in the Dark Aether dimension (which cuts 1 to 5 health every second), essentially turning every fight into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">Time-Limit Boss</a> if you can't manage to stay in a safe zone without getting shot. Some of the later fights had NO safe zones in the arena at all. <em>Metroid Prime 2</em>'s boss battles are so legendarily difficult that apparently the testers <em>used debug mode</em> to beat the Boost Guardian. The game's difficulty was nerfed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em> release.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory">An Untitled Story</a></em> is an indie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> game about a cute egg...which has plenty of pixel-perfect jumps and many bosses tend to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> phase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZakMcKrackenAndTheAlienMindbenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZakMcKrackenAndTheAlienMindbenders">Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</a></em> looks like a simple adventure game set in the city, with a cheerful main character and humorous premise. It quickly becomes apparent that almost nothing you do in this game makes sense in real life, and you have to try many ridiculous items to find something that works. If you don't pick up something before going somewhere it will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost</a> and you won't be able to progress when you need it. Not only that, but on occasion you're going against an (unseen) time limit which will send you back to earlier in the game if you don't succeed, and you can be trapped or killed quite easily...which means you have to reload the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em> is all fine and dandy until you have to procure a credit note (which requires memorising the turns of the shopkeeper's safe combination that correspond to 'pushes' and 'pulls'), which is one of the trickiest moments in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a> game, and thankfully, the only one of its kind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ETTheExtraterrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ETTheExtraterrestrial">ET The Extraterrestrial</a></em> the reviled game for Atari 2600.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> 2</em> is much harder than the other entries in the series, despite being the game where the series came into its own.
<ul><li> <em>Tekken 3</em>'s Tekken Force Mode starts off as a relatively simple sidescrolling beat-'em-up. This is until you get to Dr B, who you face after beating the mode four times. As you have one life in this mode, if you lose to him you have to complete the mode four more times in order to face him again. Luckily, there is a way of getting around this by playing a certain number of matches in versus mode.
</li><li> <em>Tekken 6</em>'s Scenario Campaign mode gets frustratingly difficult in the later stages, specifically when you have to defeat four or five different bosses within the same level.
<ul><li> That goes double for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a>, where you must fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> NPC sidekick- without help from your sidekick, naturally.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Anyone who underestimates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> just because it's by Nintendo and filled with their mascots is in for a shock. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers">Mario</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pikachu</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a> are all there, but they're not only beating the stuffing out of each other, but the interplay of attacks, movement, and inherent character traits is extremely detailed. Sure, you can pick a character and probably grasp their concept within 15 minutes, but step up past Normal mode without at least a bit of practice and you can easily end up with Mario shining his shoes with your buttocks.
<ul><li> The difficulty of the more difficult Challenger Approaching battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em> became infamous the day the game first came out. In fact, it was made notable as those kinds of battles were attributed to them being set at the 9.0 difficulty. Unlike the previous games in the franchise, where the AI simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">cheats</a> at 9.0 without seeing any notable increase in actual skill, the AI in this game is far more competent than before and will constantly dance around the player while comboing them to high percents and teching off walls and ledges at inhuman rates. They still do appear to cheat a little, but cheating aside, they're much more difficult to take on, which can make unlocking fighters outside of World of Light more of a hassle than it needs to be for less-skilled players. Even the dedicated Challenger's Approach mode doesn't help much, as losing here still leads to a cooldown period before the character can be fought again. One of the first launch week patches was forced to tone down the difficulty of these battles after the fandom became too vocal at being unable to unlock certain characters due to how downright hard these battles were.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds">Them's Fightin' Herds</a></em> has an artstyle that makes it look more like a children's Saturday morning cartoon than your typical fighting game aesthetic (which makes sense considering the game was originally a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic">fangame</a>, and even got its character designs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">the original creative director of the series</a>), and the raw input motions are fairly tame as far as fighting games go—only 4 buttons, and no inputs more complicated than a z-motion or a half circle. Despite this, the game has a <em>brutal</em> skill ceiling competitively—the combo system is more reminiscient of something like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom">Marvel vs. Capcom</a></em> series or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em>, and has equally as much character complexity.

Please note that this is an NES game, so that difficulty is in comparison to the <em>original</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> games! At the beginning of the game there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteOneUps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteOneUps">an easy method to get over 100 lives</a>. <em>You will need them all.</em>
<ul><li> Don't let the bright and colorful graphics, along with characters appealing to kids, fool you in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em>. They have lots of surprise challenges/obstacles that throw off even the most hardened platform gamers. The most famous ones are the challenges presented by the green lumas in <em>Galaxy</em> and a few of the sub-levels in Delfino Plaza in <em>Sunshine</em> and of course the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> that is the Green Star hunt in <em>Galaxy 2</em>.
</li><li> Nobody who hasn't played the game would suspect that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvZWxiUfrNo">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> vocal-only version of the original SMB track is the one used on the most fiendishly evil levels of <em>Sunshine</em>. Even worse is that, unlike in most levels of the 3D Mario games, they're mandatory! Oh, and you have to do them twice each for 100%.
<ul><li> At least during the return attempts, you have FLUDD back. Part of the challenge comes from your first attempt being without that hovering ability you've probably been taking for granted up until now.
</li><li> And you will need FLUDD's help for those return attempts, for the additional challenge is a collect-the-coin challenge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">timed</a>. And the timer isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyGenerousTimeLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyGenerousTimeLimit">generous</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the older Mario Games, which usually started off easy enough but got insanely difficult as you went along, even though some people underestimate them (and the series as a whole) for being "kiddy".
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> gets downright <em>heinous</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">the last few worlds</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Getting through the final world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> is a true test of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">will</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">patience</a>.
<ul><li> That is provided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PipeMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PipeMaze">World 7</a> doesn't destroy you first. Nine stages. Nine DIFFICULT stages, and two of the most devilishly evil fortresses in the game. World 7 has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel">breathers</a>, it starts off tricky and only escalates from there.
</li></ul></li><li> Most players just can't make it through world 8 of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> starts out fairly easy and lackadaisy, but after you beat the final boss, things change as the new Moons are now much more fiendish to acquire. In particular, the final level of the game, Darker Side, is a marathon gauntlet that lasts over ten minutes, challenges you on almost all of the Captures in the game, and has no checkpoints.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania">Mickey Mania</a></em>. As the name suggests, it's a Mickey Mouse game. It's also ridiculously difficult even on its easiest difficulty level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyHatcherAndTheGiantEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyHatcherAndTheGiantEgg">Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg</a></em> runs on this. It's very cute on the surface, but the bosses are pretty tough and the stages later on embody this trope.
<ul><li> Not to mention the Rainbow Eggs which are hard to find and even harder to get.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures">Rocket Knight Adventures</a></em> and its sequel <em>Sparkster</em> were surprisingly tricky for their level of cutesiness as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> series:
<ul><li> On standard difficulty, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand">Kirby's Dream Land</a></em>, the very first Kirby game, is very easy. However, if you enter the code to access the harder difficulty level, the game stops pulling punches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star</a></em> has shorter stages and more bosses. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">DS version</a> adds even <em>more</em> bosses and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">boss rushes.</a>
</li><li> For a person who had only played the somewhat offshoot-like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby64TheCrystalShards">Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</a></em>, <em>Nightmare in Dreamland</em> lived up to its name, especially with how cheap the enemy respawns could be.
<ul><li> And <em>Nightmare in Dreamland</em> is actually <em>easier</em> than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure">Kirby's Adventure</a></em>, of which it is a remake.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally, the <em>Kirby</em> games were made to be accessible to anyone, including kids and newcomers to gaming. So they're usually rather easy if attempting a casual playthrough. Trying to go for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">on the other hand</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysEpicYarn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysEpicYarn">Kirby's Epic Yarn</a></em> deserves a special mention because you <em>literally cannot die</em> in the game, you only lose beads. The difficulty lies in collecting all the beads needed to get a gold medal or even progress to the next levels. Also, the challenge levels can get fiendishly difficult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAndTheAmazingMirror">Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</a></em> is one of the few cases where just beating the main game is harder than the extra stuff, mainly due to starting out with a low amount of health, enemies being placed in extremely dickish locations, and losing your copy ability after one hit from <em>anything</em>.
</li><li> Many <em>Kirby</em> games have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> in them which can be horrible if you are not good with dodging the bosses attacks, but that is nothing compared to the horror that is The True Arena, appearing in games following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star Ultra</a></em>. This is an even harder version of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> where the enemies have different, more powerful and harder to dodge attacks and finishes off with at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> which likely comes up after you are completely drained.
</li><li> While the base game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies">Kirby Star Allies</a></em> is considered fairly easy by <em>Kirby</em> standards (even when you're going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>), the Wave 3 update introduced Heroes of Another Dimension and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Soul Melter EX</a>, which took it to the other extreme and are among the most <em>difficult</em> modes ever introduced in a <em>Kirby</em> game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrillDozer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrillDozer">Drill Dozer</a></em>, in which the game stars an adorable little girl with a little adorable robot with drills for arms...but to get 100%, you have to beat levels with platforming so hard you will cry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LocoRoco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LocoRoco">LocoRoco</a></em>'s cute and whimsical art direction masks its diabolically evil gameplay in the <em>Midnight Carnival</em> spinoff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy">Dynamite Headdy</a></em> is bright and cartoonish, but only a little harder than you might expect, until it ramps up significantly during and after the flying world. The Nasty Gatekeeper (following the much easier normal Gatekeeper) is pretty much the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseDifficulty">Surprise Difficulty</a>, with music to match.
<ul><li> That's the American/European version, by the way. The original Japanese version is still not easy, but the difficulty level is much more reasonable (and it gives you 3 continues by default).
<ul><li> The Japanese version has its own surprise difficulty (though technically more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a>) in the form of Twin Freaks. It's already considered to be one of the hardest bosses in the U.S/Euro game, and has twice as much health in this version, ignoring a certain glitch.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> You wouldn't expect a game with cartoon-style graphics about a boy trying to rescue his dog from monsters to be anything other than an easy kids game, would you? Well, if that game is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartOfDarkness">Heart of Darkness</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, prepare to be surprised. The game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> powered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a></em> series stars a dolphin as the player character. This dolphin will die, many, many times, be it via drowning, sharks, angry telepathic DNA, alien technology, or a particularly murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoScrollingLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoScrollingLevel">edge of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel">screen</a>.
<ul><li> It also ramps up the difficulty for certain stages. When sharks were easily something you could dodge or fight, in "Open Ocean" they suddenly have a much more damaging attack and litter the entire screen. Near the end, scrolling stages occur. One being five minutes long. The Vortex Queen isn't easy either...and if you die or get eaten by the Vortex Queen? Back to the five minute long level. "Welcome To The Machine" will be burned into your retinas by the time you memorize it.
</li><li> <em>Tides of Time</em> features the Skyway, a set of gorgeous mazes in water tubes high in the sky. Hope you like falling! <em>Defender of the Future</em> plays a loving homage to the Skyway with the Hanging Waters levels...breathtaking beauty and enraging difficulty and all.
</li><li> Ecco was such a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseDifficulty">Surprise Difficulty</a> that a kid-friendly spinoff <em>Ecco Jr.</em> was eventually released, as an apology of sorts to all the children who asked their parents for "the cute dolphin game" only get their asses utterly kicked by the sadistic difficulty of the main series.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc">Croc</a></em> games for the PlayStation are more challenging than you'd think.
<ul><li> Mainly due to their camera angles and dodgy jumping. Oh and the enemies respawn a few seconds after you beat them.
</li></ul></li><li> For games based on a children's cartoon series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> had tons of games that, while averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">The Problem with Licensed Games</a>, are still notorious for their difficulties.
<ul><li> The 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyToonAdventures">game of the same name</a> would chew you up and spit you out. It doesn't help that, unless you have a heart in your inventory, everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kills you with one hit</a>.
</li><li> The sequel, <em>Trouble in Wackyland</em> is comparatively easier for the most part. It helps that that game has a three-heart health bar. However, while Plucky, Hamton, and Furrball's levels are fairly easy to get through, Babs' level, which involves an out-of-control roller coaster, requires a great amount of memorization of when to jump, duck, and flip the car to get through.

Thus, if you die, you start all the way back at the beginning of the stage.
</li></ul></li><li> The little-known Dreamcast game <em>Super Magnetic Neo</em>. It involves playing with a cutesy robot with magnetic powers having platforming adventures and taking on a bunch of cartoony villains led by a baby. Sounds simple enough, right? However, since it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">inspired by</a> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> games (the Naughty Dog games, mind you)...you better prepare to suffer.
</li><li> The first few levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a></em> are pretty easy. Then you reach Band Land and your whole world goes straight to hell. Suddenly the levels require dead-on precision and reflexes just to survive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeapOfFaith">Leaps of Faith</a> to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffens</a> required to advance the game, and those frigging <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">grasshoppers</a></em>. Even if you have 99 lives through cheats or some other method, expect to be down at least 25 by the time you finish.
<ul><li> An even better example comes in the little-known edutainment spinoff <em>Rayman Brain Games</em>. As an edutainment game, you'd think it would be laughably easy, as is par for the genre. That's the kind of thinking that gets you killed, as this game intended for young children somehow, in some freakish way, manages to be <em>even harder than the already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">notoriously difficult</a> original</em>, at times bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>. Sadly, this is mainly due to copious amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> rather than genuine challenge, like being expected to react to hazards suddenly blinking in out of nowhere with inhuman reflexes. Still, it makes you wonder what the hell they were smoking when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">they thought this was appropriate for young grade-school children</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klonoa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klonoa">Klonoa</a></em> games, even the GBA puzzle/platformers, start out incredibly easy and have a slow, gentle curve...until you reach the last couple of levels in each of them, at which point they become vicious one-way tickets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>. And let's not even get to those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">crazy secret hidden levels...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, especially the final zone, Eggmanland, seems to fall into this trope. Players tend to look at the ESRB rating (E10+) and assume, then are surprised when the game rips them a new one.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>: Part 1</em> is bizarrely difficult. The first level is not hard at all, but the remaining three are. Specifically there is a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark">Casino Street Zone</a> (Casinos are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel">Breather Levels</a> in <em>Sonic</em> games) where you have to jump across a set of moving cards that stay flat for a second then go vertical, so you fall to your death. The problem with this is that there are far too many of these and you'd have to have sheer luck in order to jump them all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld">Sonic Lost World</a></em> stands alongside <em>Unleashed</em> as one of the more surprisingly difficult games in the series. Compounded with a completely new physics and control system that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">will mess up those who have played any of the previous game</a>, and you've got an exercise in frustration in the making. The very cartoonish and colorful art style compared to the previous games doesn't help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> has difficulty on par with the classic 16-bit games it was based on, which can be jarring for those who didn't grow up playing them. In particular, most of the game's stage design punishes anyone who tries to blindly rush forward. Even for those who did grow up with these games, <em>Sonic Mania</em> will still put up a fight and never let up.

Up through Field 5, it's pretty straightforward. Field 6 ramps up the difficulty a bit. Pretty much any field thereafter skyrockets into <em>completely bonkers</em> levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>:
<ul><li> A level where you have to grapple across a ceiling to get to the exit...interspersed with patches of ceiling <em>that your hook won't stick to?</em> Check!
</li><li> A boss fight in which you have to grapple your way <em>under the stage</em> to dodge him, then get back up before his tadpoles nibble you to death...<em>five times</em> (before he self-destructs, you can't hurt him)? Check!
</li><li> Levels loaded with (sometimes <em>unkillable</em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats">Goddamn Bats</a>? Check!
</li><li> Levels with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">no floor</a></em> beneath you as you frantically grapple your way to the end? Check!
</li><li> All of this <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">on a timer</a>?</em> Check!
</li><li> <em>Umihara Kawase</em> is probably the only game in history to give the player 10 lives to <em>start</em> with and have it considered <em>stingy</em>.
<ul><li> And the ironic thing is that after you get past the learning curve, you realise that all those bits are the <em>easy</em> parts. Seriously. They're fun. It gets harder.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>. The very last section of the game has the difficulty curve surge upwards like crazy.
<ul><li> Here, have a rising lava level, jumping between awkward platforms with this game's finicky and awkward controls; a level style which had previously been avoided in the game. Surprise!
</li></ul></li><li> The cute looks of <em>Gimmick</em> (AKA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrGimmick">Mr. Gimmick</a></em>) for the NES will disguise its tricky enemy and level design. It is actually even worse due to your main weapon being pathetic, and the character having a <em>very</em> annoying inertia.

But the game takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> to entirely new levels. Even with savestates, it's hard.
<ul><li> It wasn't that easy on the Gameboy either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> games for the SNES were just...insane. In the first like most platformers can give you a ridiculous number of lives if you know where to look. However it is probably the only game that expects you to <em>use</em> them. <em>Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt</em>, completing a single area would take upwards of half an hour (if you knew where to go and how to progress through the levels), you were required to fight a difficult boss at the end of it (by which stage you'd be severely low on lives and energy), and then you got to do the whole thing <em>again</em> for the other eighteen million items you needed to collect. Oh, and did we mention that you can't save or in any way record your progress? Yeah. This from the TV show that gave us Lurch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em>: Awww, it's a cute little sackboy! Aww, look at him running around with his tongue out! Aww...wait, impact explosives? With jetpacks? And falling stalactites? This isn't cute, this is cruel! You want me to fight bosses now? There weren't any bosses before! And what's this about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">a Bunker</a>?
</li><li> The level with Goofy in the game <em>Mickey's Ultimate Challenge</em>. <em>Especially</em> on the hardest level.

Yep. Charming fantasy worlds to explore? Yep. Is this deceptive at all? YES. If some of the later levels weren't difficult enough, there's also the eighty hidden cat medals (some of which are deviously hidden) to collect, and the Nintendo Hard final boss, who is an absolute nightmare to defeat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>:
<ul><li> It might look gorgeous, and no sane player would expect a game about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">monkeys</a> collecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheMoney">bananas</a> to be hard, but worlds 5 and 6 in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">first game</a> cross the line rather quickly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>.

You have to wonder if the universe seems to really hate gorrilas after playing some of the temple levels.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a> DS</em>. It's a sequel to one of the best loved platform games of all time...and brings back one of the nastier elements: its insane secret level difficulty. Worlds 1 to 3 are fairly easy. World 4 amplifies it. World 5 is a difficulty brick wall, with more spikes in the last two castles than probably the rest of the game proceeding it. Then you get the secret and extra levels. World 4's is doable. World 1 and 2's trap you and force Yoshi to die for every minor mistake, and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">nigh-on zero checkpoints</a>. Worlds 3 and 5's...are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> incarnate, and you'll need the huge lives stockpile you've collected after a few choice sections cost you fifty or so lives in quick succession.
<ul><li> The game that started it on the SNES isn't any different either. The game starts off very simple and the crayon-styled graphics may lure players into thinking it's a game meant for babies, but around halfway through the game, the difficulty shoots up greatly as you have to deal with tricky gap crossing using a power up or Yoshi's floaty jump or trying to avoid nothing but spikes, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">instant death</a>. Going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>? The extra levels in each world will make you hurl your controller and swear at a game that just looks too damn cute to be swearing at.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand">Wario Land</a> 4</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandShakeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandShakeIt">Shake It / Shake Dimension</a></em> are colorful and have a silly atmosphere, but turn brutally difficult rather quickly. For the former, it's not the easier difficulties, those are incredibly nice to the player. But then you've got Super Hard mode. Yes, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a>, but compared to the normal difficulty levels, is like going from Normal to Intense in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a>.</em> Some levels like Pinball Zone and Arabian Night. for example, literally have next to no time for the level's length in question, and getting over 10,000 coins for 100% completion is nigh on impossible due to incredibly mean enemy placement and time limits. The first boss in the game has a time limit of <strong>15 seconds</strong>, just to give you an idea. <em>Shake It/ Shake Dimension</em> just has the much more difficult than the rest of the series boss battles and the bonus challenges which make you survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Bosses</a> as a semi one hit wonder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryHatsworthInThePuzzlingAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryHatsworthInThePuzzlingAdventure">Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure</a></em> is a fun little puzzle/platform hybrid that looks like your typical casual game at first glance, but the difficulty curve goes sharply up after the first world, with tricky platforming and tough bosses. The final world in particular contains some of the most challenging platformer gameplay out there, and beating the final boss is an achievement to brag about. And if you're playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Gentleman Mode</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">all bets are off</a>.

Maybe nowadays you're not surprised it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> since it's a primitive NES platformer, but back then you really expected at least some leniency out of a game based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Nope, it's one of the hardest games on a platform famous for hard games.
</li><li> Okay, even if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em> is <strong>never</strong> considered to be a game for kids, it still fits this trope at least because the difficulty may get really <em>surprising</em> at times, thanks to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou">Everything Is Trying to Kill You</a>. Even the things that are not obvious killers. <em>Yet.</em> <em>IWBTG</em> deserves some sort of prize in that, despite over-the-top ridiculous difficulty being the one thing the game is known for, it <em>still</em> manages to be surprisingly harder than whatever you were expecting when you started.
</li><li> While the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ABoyAndHisBlob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ABoyAndHisBlob">A Boy and His Blob</a></em> cuts down on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moments of the original, and the beginning levels are so easy they've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">earned ire,</a> everything after World 1 is a guaranteed behind-kicking at least once.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em>. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicoot1996">the first one</a>. It's ostensibly for kids and the other games in the series are very manageable...but not the first one. Even if you manage to get through 2-3 levels without running out of lives (you start with 4 every time you load) AND find all the "Tawna tokens" in the level, you only have one shot at a bonus level to even be able to <em>save</em> or <em>find out your level password</em>. The physics fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>, even (or especially) for people who have played the other games in the series. The lack of analog control also makes fine movement very, very difficult at times.
<ul><li> Collecting gems requires you to destroy every single destructible crate in the level. In the first game, some levels require you to fully explore two paths in order to do this. You won't know until you finish the level whether you missed any. Good luck. Oh, and you have to finish the entire level without dying.

To make up for it, the developers kept everything in from the first one...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">and added more</a></em>. Branching paths? Have fun exploring them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackoutBasement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackoutBasement">in the dark</a>, with bottomless pits everywhere! Secret levels? Be prepared to not only endure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> to get to them, but the levels themselves are brutal. Backtracking? Of course - and let's throw in a few levels where you not only have to backtrack, but you have to backtrack <em>without dying</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">Warped</a></em> eased up on difficulty a bit, but still has plenty of challenges to throw at you. Of note is the new Time Trial mode, requiring you to finish the level within a certain amount of time to win a relic. Getting the Sapphire and even Gold isn't too tough, but if you want the Platinum relic you'll virtually have to speedrun the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a></em> mercifully made some difficult challenges a little easier, such as removing the no deaths requirement to earn a regular gem. However, it has plenty of difficulty all its own: The physics are now the same across all three games, making some challenges significantly harder than they once were, and Crash has a pill-shaped hitbox that can result in him slipping off of edges. Time Trials have been added to the first two games, bringing a whole new challenge to the already difficult games. Two new levels, Future Tense and Stormy Ascent were added as DLC... the latter of which was a cancelled Crash 1 level removed for being too difficult. <em>Too difficult for the game that is generally considered the hardest in the series</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the same vein as <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a></em> series come in play. While the second installment of these series is comparatively easy (unless you go for Skill Points), the first and the third parts aren't actually to be beaten to 100% and higher status by children under 10. The starting moments may be easy (although some players may be gameovered in the first worlds), but sidequests and hidden walls/areas may become a pain in the ass (unless you know them all thoroughly). Several enemies may also become these, and again, their attacks are easy to avoid if you've played this game a lot before. But no matter how experienced may you be on these, there are also <em>flights</em> to be beaten...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Tomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Tomba">Tomba!</a>!/Tombi!</em> for the PS1. You play as a pink haired dwarf who lives in a colorful world filled with psychotic pigs and carnivorous venus fly traps. Typically Japanese right? Well, it is in other aspects too - it often relies on timing to get somewhere without being killed, you need certain items (which you equip like an RPG), your life goes down very easily, and there are many occasions where the 2.5D of the game makes it look as if you can go somewhere you can't from that angle, leading to frustration.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Plok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Plok">Plok</a></em>. You play as a sentient pile of clothing who could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punch</a>, and the graphics were really cutesy.

There were also quite a lot of traps and spikes in the game that were hard to traverse... And then you get to the last world...which is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">wall-to-wall</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a></em>.

In fact, using said cheat is pretty much mandatory if you want to have any hope of completing the game. The code is even listed in the manual, so the developers were probably self-aware.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> is based on a Disney movie; this'll be easy, right? Well, remember the "Just Can't Wait To Be King" scene from the movie, with Simba jumping from animal to animal? Yep, that's a level in the game. It's as hard as you'd imagine. And it's <em>level 2</em>. They get much worse from there. The following level contains 15-20 enemies that in many games would be mini-boss fights. And you can't save.

Your raygun is replaced by flower-power, seeds that temporary turn enemies into flowers. It is one the hardest one of the Commander Keen series. The fact that you cannot kill your enemies permanently forces you to be very careful with your ammunition and play as fast as possible to avoid the enemies regenerating.

Turns out the invincibility goes both ways, and the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> attacks will shave off most of your health if you're lucky. And that's without getting into the masochistic Hard Mode, where enemies deal double damage, shields break in one pop, and the bosses are faster and completely randomized their strategies. And playing as Milla gives you a very awkward combat style, with half the health of the other characters. Yeah, hope you don't lose your marbles.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrashPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrashPanic">Trash Panic</a></em> is a cartoonish game where you smash garbage off of other garbage to break it up so the bin doesn't fill up. Simple right? The game's own demo has a time limit that obscures how tough the game is by ending the run early. However, actually finishing the levels of the full version is brutally hard; the garbage just keeps coming. You can burn garbage (bad for your Eco score), but if you burn or otherwise destroy valuable trash, your bin will overflow with penalty garbage. Not to mention the boss garbage, but even the Sweets (beginner) course which doesn't feature it is still pretty hard, even though the game has no limit on continues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shivers">Shivers</a> II: Harvest of Souls</em> fits this trope more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, unlike its predecessor. Puzzles range from the dead simple "fit tiles into shape" puzzle, to the notorious "fixed moves you can make to match all colored marbles in their correct spots" puzzle in the Warehouse. There are more easier puzzles than harder ones, but I guarantee the "Solve Puzzle" feature will be used more than once on a first play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Audiosurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Audiosurf">Audiosurf</a></em> is an interesting case. While you may be able to guess that some tracks will be hard when loaded up in the game, sometimes you get a nasty surprise thrown your way and what you thought would be an easy run turns out to be much harder than you thought it would be.
<ul><li> One weird example of something harder than expected is loading up a file of just white or pink noise. The game procedurally generates the level based on the rhythm of the music, but because white noise has little information to distinguish the 'easy' from the 'hard' parts of the song, the algorithm makes <em>everything</em> difficult.

Fan-generated level packs are even worse, as they pulling off stunts that are usually considered <em>illegal</em> (like hiding traps and objects <em>underneath floor tiles</em>).

Wait too long and you won't boost at all, but you need to get as close to the end as possible for the largest boost. And if you drift too long without boosting, you'll spin out entirely. So, that adds some challenge, but isn't too bad right? Well, there are also "reserves". As you boost, you'll fill reserves that allow you to maintain your speed until you run out. Including the speed from turbo pads and super turbo pads that are faster than a drift boost. So, to perform optimally, you need to keep your reserves full <em>all the time</em>, which means you basically need to always be drifting and chaining together perfectly timed boosts, while avoiding hazards and power-ups.</span>, though fortunately the AI isn't too fast, and they can't use some of the more powerful items like the Warp Orb or Clock.

It's not uncommon to see people assume that since it's a bot game, they'll just dink around or that the other players wouldn't mind someone sabotaging the game. Except that only a few people seem to realize that bots are much better farmers than players are, it's impossible to stop them from farming, and that they receive items on a <em>timer</em> rather than having to actually <em>buy</em> them. So if you're stuck on a team full of players who prefer to just run laps around the map or play around thinking "Free win!", they'll wind up surprised when they're facing champions with thousands of HP and tons of armor on top of godlike reflexes, focus-firing skills, and crowd control.
<ul><li> Not to mention, if one doesn't entirely know what they're in for, they might be surprised on playing a champion to find that they're harder than they look.
</li><li> Two words: Annie Bot. Here's a bot controlling a character whose entire playstyle is based on stunning you and offloading 3 high damage spells as fast as possible, with instant reflexes and impossible aim, and it gains free items that are always one step ahead of the player. Magic resist defeats this, but for the many players that don't want to sacrifice their damage to buy some defense, she is their worst nightmare.
</li><li> Trundle Bot also manages to place that stupid environmental hazard <em>in the worst possible spots</em>.
</li><li> Some players see a champion, either an ally who beats enemies up or are pummeled into oblivion by a champion (Usually a carry or assassin) and think they're easy. Then they realize that it's not that easy.
<ul><li> Note that this is usually because the champion seen has a very hard early and/or late phase (in exchange for an easy late and/or early phase), requires very specific items, requires lots of farm and/or enemy kills to get enough gold for their expensive items, requires very good map awareness and/or guesswork of enemy locations, requires very deep understanding of their skills and abilities or any combination of the above. It is quite easy to find first time users of such champions failing very, very hard.

<ul><li> Drow Ranger gets more damage if no enemy heroes are 400 units near of her. Considering there are alot of items to initiate and alot of heroes than can close the distance, this can be very hard to keep the distance.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustDance">Just Dance</a></em> may count as well for the harder levels.

Think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a>, only all the (mini)games are rhythm songs. Seems easy, huh? Wrong. Some of the games will prove to be pretty hard, and some requirements are INSANE. On some stages, getting as few as two misses results in a fail for the stage. Not a D grade, not some mild ridicule, absolute, abject failure. Oh, and the visuals never match the rhythm closely enough, so you MUST rely on the music or you will fail. Luckily, you can skip them all if you want after three tries, and you'll pass most games after some practice.

<ul><li> Hottest Party still caught a few gamers off guard who thought they knew the series and didn't read the instructions. And even the instructions don't tell you exactly how you're supposed to swing the Wii Mote and trying to figure out what do do with your hands easily messes up your steps. Added gimmick steps didn't help either.
</li><li> Songs by jun as of recent. Yes, Silver Dream may be a pretty happy song, until you realize that it's a level ten boss song on expert.
</li><li> Disney DDR. Should be a cakewalk, right? Admittedly, the songs aren't <em>that</em> terrible, but some of them ("Nobody's Perfect" by Miley Cyrus comes to mind) seem to be a lot harder than you'd expect from a Disney-themed DDR game.
</li><li> Some first-time players have a perception that, since DDR doesn't punish you for hitting an arrow when not prompted, that must mean you can get a "good enough" score by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacManFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacManFever">randomly stomping around not paying attention to the screen</a> and are surprised when it doesn't work. The technical explanation for this is there is a large "Almost" timing window that triggers if you hit an arrow with poor timing; even if the arrow is hit again, the poorly-timed hit (which drains health) has already applied.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em>. Not all the really hard songs have titles like "Raining Blood" or "Hangar 18". Some of the nastiest songs are innocent sounding names like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand">Jessica</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomeStarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomeStarRunner">Trogdor</a>".

</li><li> For vocals, many pop songs in Nightmare Tier get this sort of reaction. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">Good Vibrations</a>" is a feel good surf rock song that makes you sing in a three octave range within a strange key amid bizarre lilting staccato-legato rhythm and almost no accompaniment. Then it slows down, makes you speak for a few measures, speeds up to a different speed and changes keys. Have fun!

Just because it's family friendly doesn't mean it isn't difficult; while they tried to cherry-pick easier songs to an extent and lowered the thresholds of the difficulty tiers to compensate, the charting standards are no different from the original game, so the solos to, for example, "The Final Countdown" and "In Too Deep" don't hold anything back on the Expert difficulty. To take the point further, one achievement asks the player to get 100% on the former's guitar solo on Expert, which is many times harder than any of the achievements in <em>Rock Band 2</em>.

What many of them don't realize is that the game <em>will</em> penalize you for "getting creative" with how you sing, and it's even possible to fail miserably on easy mode while playing a song <em>you know</em> if you don't have a feel for how much you need to match the pitch.

Its gameplay is similar to the (also very tough) Rhythm Heaven series, only you are not penalized for being slightly off.

In Izuna, even at level 99 the final dungeon can be a nightmare. Compared to many other Roguelikes, this is pretty easy as the heroine maintains her levels even after being defeated.

(Admittedly, the game is still in the testing phases, so this is subject to change). Not to mention some of the instanced levels such as The Hive World, The Gauntlet, and The Shallow Sea scale based on your CL, so that an enemy will always be the same relative level to you. This includes the final boss. zOMG is a very fun game featuring a vibrant colorful world, high levels of character customization, and a fun story, and it's easy to pick up.

Then they were faced by the 107 missiles that the boss spawned while you were going through the run <strong>again</strong>. It wasn't really that good, since after three hours, people kind of had to leave to take a break from the last ten hours spent on the "casual" MMO. It wasn't really that effective, unless you were <em>really</em> fast, since the boss tended to restore health anyway, but at least you didn't have to start <em>all</em> the way over from the beginning of the boss fight...but wait, the new update changed it that if all six crew members are dazed, you're escorted out of the room! And this is all if your computer can handle Shallow Seas without lagging and dying, anyway.

This means all you really have at your disposal besides your current offensive abilities are few items, Once More and your own skill to defend you, and because you have Once More equipped but not Second Chance, usually the harder bosses can one shot you if the hits they give you aren't one of a combo. Definitely the most difficult Critical Mode in a KH game to date.
</li><li> At this point, one has to wonder a little why people would still be fooled enough by the Disney logo to go into the game thinking it'd be easy.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> series of RPGs have artwork by Akira Toriyama and a general Pokémon style look to the settings, but the games are regarded as some of the hardest JRPGs, though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV">Dragon Quest V</a></em> tends to be one of the easier installments (it's followed by the harder <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI">Dragon Quest VI</a></em>, however). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Remakes</a> tend to tone down the difficulty a bit, though the games still stay challenging (just less so than the original versions).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonYellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonYellow">Pokémon Yellow</a></em> is <em>significantly</em> harder than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Red and Blue</a></em> versions. All the Gym Leaders and rival battles have new, more powerful teams, and since you start out with Pikachu, the game takes a jump into the wilderness of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> when you find out that the first Gym Leader you have to face is Brock.
<ul><li> Brock was actually made weaker than in the originals. They also made several Pokemon that could easily roundhouse his team (such as Mankey) available early. There are also the male and female Nidoran. In this game, they earn Double Kick very early, so you can beat Brock with a Nidoran very easily. And they're found in the same place as Mankey. Then you come up to Misty (who as a water type leader should be weak to Pikachu) and find she is terrifyingly strong even with Pikachu.
</li><li> Speaking of Pokemon, older players should remember <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a></em> and its sequel, which were focused on battling hordes of AI trainers under some pretty fiendish conditions (such as using only baby Pokemon, randomly selected Pokemon, level limits, etc.). Round 1 in both games tended to be difficult as the player progressed and would require legitimate skill to beat, but most of it wasn't too bad. Round 2 bordered on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">frustrating AI</a> and the general feeling that it was pretty much made for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuy">Stop Having Fun Guy</a> sector of the fanbase.
<ul><li> The <em>Stadium</em> games were even worse if you didn't have a Transfer Pak to bring your Pokémon over from the Game Boy games and thus had to rely on the crappy rental Pokémon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond and Pearl</a></em> seem to have an accidental case of difficulty. Due to the fact that Sinnoh's region dex had little variety, the Gym Leaders and Elite Four didn't had enough of their chosen type to actually fill a team, and the resulting loosely connected replacements (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny">Playboy Bunny</a> on the fire team? Sure it's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">hot</a>" but...) make them impossible to sweep with a single move like the past 3 generations.
<ul><li> Thankfully, much of this was fixed in Platinum. Extra mons were added to the Sinnoh dex, allowing the Gym leaders and Elite Four members to have teams consisting entirely of their type, in addition to allowing more variety in the player's team.
</li><li> Not to mention, the updated movesets caught a lot of people off guard because they wouldn't expect almost <em>every</em> Pokémon available to have a move to use when fighting its weakness. Ah, using a Luxray on me? Well Torterra, I think it's time to use Earthqua-ICE FANG?! How'd you get that?!
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, with the added bonus of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Video Game Remakes</a> and therefore most fans <em>thinking</em> they have a pretty good idea of the difficulty level to expect. <em>They'd be wrong</em>. The Gym Leaders actually employ advanced tactics (while not as bad as actual Sporepunch, Hypnosispunch still hurts), now have abilities that they put to good effect (you can no longer avoid Miltank's Stomp by using a Ghost-type as its ability lets it ignore Ghost's immunity to Normal-type moves), have teams with perfect IVs (Kanto even had its non-Gym trainers' levels raised because the whole region was otherwise a curb stomp), and the final boss now has even higher levels.
<ul><li> The simple matter of Houndoom getting one new move (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Nasty Plot</a>) in the generation shift made Elite Four Karen <em>much</em>, <strong>much</strong> harder than she was before, which often comes as a shock to players of the originals.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> actually surprised a few, but after Gen IV's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike">Sequel Difficulty Spike</a> we knew what to expect so the updated movesets didn't catch people off guard. Instead, it's the improved AI that uses more instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a> outside of important trainers. Even Pokémon Rangers (default trainer classes) use techniques such as baiting and switching.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> would also qualify for some who think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">the ease in overlevelling is a bit over the top</a>. After being overlevelled for a while, you'll probably forget that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">important trainers are still no slouch when it comes to making educated guesses about type relations and strategic move combinations</a>, and if you don't use any of the ways you can get overleveled, you will find that the game is still as difficult as the past two generations. Specific examples would be Viola and Grant, the first two gym leaders, because most Bug/Rock gym leaders in previous games suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorPredictableRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorPredictableRock">Poor, Predictable Rock</a>, and these two don't, or at least not to the same extent. (More specifically, Viola has the Bug/Water Surkit to annoy anyone bringing in a Fire-Type, while Grant's Rock/Ice and Rock/Dragon types counter or resist a couple of Rock's common weaknesses.) And if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">forego the Exp Share entirely</a>, X and Y become some of the hardest games in the series; particularly in the late game, trainers' Pokémon are high-leveled enough to easily punish anyone who hasn't been using it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> ups the difficulty by removing some of the ways you could become overpowered in <em>X And Y</em> and nerfing the ones it keeps. The addition of the new SOS system means wild Pokémon battles can become two on one battles at any time. The game also removes gyms and replaces the leaders with Totem Pokémon; they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> added at the start of the battle which generally increase whatever their most prominent stat is, or all of them. They can also use the SOS system and the Pokémon they summon allow them to use double battle strategies against you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">and they are not afraid to use them.</a> And unlike Mega Evolution in X and Y, which only 2 bosses in the game used against you, there are many opponents who use Z-Moves, some of them being regular trainers.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER">Mother</a></em> trilogy looks simple and cartoony, but all three games have some serious difficulty. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER1">MOTHER</a></em> consistently goes up in difficulty, although there's a couple of major spikes at Duncan's Factory (due mostly to its size) and Mt. Itoi (the enemies being way harder than anywhere else in the game). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, despite being much better than its predecessor, had random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spikes</a> throughout the game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> finally settled for a consistent difficulty, and while the regular enemies aren't too bad, the bosses will mash you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> definitely qualifies for this trope, despite everything looking like a cardboard cutout. While the first Paper Mario wasn't too difficult, provided you pay attention and learn the game mechanics, this game ramps up the difficulty quite a bit. Bosses having tons of HP and having at least one attack that can do massive damage to the party, being forced at one point to go alone when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doopliss steals Mario's body and his allies</span>, and enemies inflicting nasty status ailments such as Freeze, Sleep, and Stop, which can end your game if you're not careful.
<ul><li> Similarily, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> RPGs (except <em>Superstar Saga</em>) were pretty deceptive about their difficulty. They have bright, Mario-typical graphics, but the enemies and bosses can get <em>very</em> deadly if you don't master the battle-mechanics of dodging and countering attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em> takes this up even further. You thought this was going to be about the same difficulty as the last games? Think again. This one is much harder still (although you can go easy mode if you lose a fight). For example some attacks need to be dodged with the circle pad now and attacks can hit <em>much</em> harder. And the giant bosses? Not basically glorified cut scenes this time around, with the second or third giant boss of <em>Dream Team</em> being on par with the last two from <em>Bowser's Inside Story.</em>
<ul><li> For extra fun, try Hard Mode. No retrying fights, cap of ten on every item, shorter windows for action commands, and yes, the Giant Battles get harder too, to the point that the rematches in the late-game Battle Arena demand absolute perfection just to clear them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</a></em> drops the difficulty a little bit when compared to the previous game but it is still difficult. This is mostly due to the addition of a third character who unlike the two from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">the second game</a> is completely independent of the two Mario Bros. and makes dodging attacks much harder, especially attacks that attack multiple characters.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em> RPG, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeoQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeoQuest">NeoQuest</a></em>. You really wouldn't expect an RPG based on cute animals to be so difficult, especially since the first dungeon is so disarmingly easy.
<ul><li> <em>NeoQuest II</em>'s difficulty takes a turn for the nasty as you get closer and closer to Meridell Castle and Ramtor's Tower. And Meridell is the <em>first world</em> (of 5).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFuckboys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFuckboys">Five Nights at Fuckboy's</a></em>. You wouldn't expect a crude, foul mouthed and raunchy parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> to be difficult, but the Mooks can hit pretty hard, there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap">Absurdly Low Level Cap</a>, the bosses can be hard even at maximum level and are frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">meaty ones as well</a>, and this isn't even factoring in different difficulty levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> may look cutesy and the tagline is "The Friendly RPG Where Nobody has to Die", but don't let those elements fool you. Battles use bullet hell segments when you are attacked and the gimmicks ramp up in difficulty as you face off against the bosses. And if you attempt to utilize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a> to the fullest, the game will make you pay, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">badly</a>.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> may have cute character designs, beautiful dungeons, and a pretty game interface full of relaxing blues and greens. Looks much easier on the eyes than Atlus's other big RPG franchise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> so it can't be that hard, right? Haha, <strong>wrong.</strong> Beneath that surface lies a device-tossingly challenging RPG series filled with difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter">Random Encounters</a>, even harder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreExistingEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreExistingEncounters">Pre Existing Encounters</a> called "FOEs" that <em>will</em> instantly destroy any party unlucky or stupid enough to run into one, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks">Skill Scores and Perks</a> system that's easy for those without critical thinking skills to mess up leaving them with poorly-built characters, and a brutal in-game economy that basically says "Oh, you're back from dungeon exploring? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Inn healing</a>, one piece of new equipment, consumable supplies: Pick one." To put it this way: It is not uncommon for series beginners to go into the first floor of any given game <em>and get party-wiped by a random encounter there</em>. This series will test the patience and determination of many gamers, from kids who think the game is suited for them to adults expecting the game to be a pushover. It is rather telling that it took <em>four</em> games for the developers to finally add an easy mode for those who like the concept of the game but don't want to put in the arduous amount of blood, sweat, and tears needed to complete the game at the series' traditional level of difficulty, <em>especially</em> its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostEndGameContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostEndGameContent">Post-End Game Content</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend Of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC</a></em> has a bright and colourful artstyle with chibi sprites. And its prequel, and sequels, aren't that difficult, so it can't be that bad, right? <em>Wrong</em>. The game easily rivals most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> games in difficulty. The game is tough even on Normal, but Hard multiplies enemy stats to such an extent that most people only recommend it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> runs. And that's not even getting into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Nightmare Mode</a>. To put this in perspective, it's common for players to spend dozens of attempts before you can beat it, and on Nightmare the Prologue's boss is generally considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> (barring extreme luck) if you don't use your resources in a very specific way. Many bosses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">use specific tactics that are designed to screw with you</a>, abuse of the Turn Order Bonuses is required to outlast many chest monsters/sidequest bosses, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">just about everything on the Liber Ark wants you dead</a>. Late in the game just when you think the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enforcers</span> are just a bunch of pushovers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Renne</span> will open the fight with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">S-Break</a> that's <em>50% instant death to anyone without instant death immunity</em>, and even <em>with</em> immunity, she still has good Crafts and a whole bunch of mooks that'll Petrify you and take up several turns before you can so much as heal. Her rematch then has you fight pater-Mater, who has strong attacks and will instantly revive Renne at full health if you try killing her first. Finally, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Loewe</a>, who puts many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> to shame that can easily one-shot the entire party with the S-Craft he opens the fight with. It's so hard the game lets you progressively retry with weaker stats, and is considered harder than the final boss. Even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Aidios blesses you</a> with less than three clones and doesn't spam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">Demon Flames</a>, he's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> qualifies less for its graphics (though no enemy has a horrifying appearance by JRPG standards and some are quite cute) and more for the outward appearance of its battle system. At first glance, the battle system makes the game look like a typical ATB experience that won't be too different from early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games or "cookie-cutter" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RPGMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RPGMaker">RPG Maker</a> games. This turns out not to be the case due to how the game adds several unusual mechanics and reinvents some of the traditional RPG mechanics, forcing experienced RPG players to adapt and learn. Additionally, the protagonist is considered a powerful vampire in the story, but the party will still struggle against bosses due to how healing is balanced so that slow HP regeneration is easy while instant HP recovery is difficult, making it hard to stay alive in long battles.
</li><li> Most games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier">Atelier</a></em> series are hit with this (except for those on PS2, which are more traditional JRPGs and look the part). The series has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> aesthetic and tends towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> stories instead of epic, fate-of-the-world quests, but those expecting to have a relaxing time are in for a shock. If you don't master the complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> mechanics that the series revolves around, enemies will quickly become much more powerful than you can handle. And in many of these games, you also have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">time limit</a> that prevents you from experimenting and messing around too much, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">relying on level grinding to make up for your equipment</a>. The protagonists are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy">Item Caddies</a> who deal most of their damage by throwing limited-supply bombs, which in most games are replenished by crafting (consuming more of your limited time). Once you found the right balance between crafting and exploring, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a> are there to ruin your day, posing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> challenge that will annihilate any player that doesn't have the best possible equipment.
</li><li> Even by the standards of <em>Atelier</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NelkeAndTheLegendaryAlchemistsAteliersOfTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NelkeAndTheLegendaryAlchemistsAteliersOfTheNewWorld">Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World</a></em> took many players by surprise with its complexity and challenge. The game's marketing led many to expect a Facebook-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualGame">Casual Game</a> driven more by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> than actual gameplay. In truth, it's a deep and complex town-building simulator where the goals you have to meet are sometimes brutally difficult (especially the eighth and ninth missions, which have sent many new players towards the bad ending). And while the most recent <em>Atelier</em> games before its release had removed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> aspect, it's back in full force here.

Those who aren't go in for the loads of cute little girls in frilly dresses living in a cheerful fairy land, only to find out at about level 2 or 3 that these little girls <em>love</em> shooting enough ordnance to carpet bomb the entire United States. And <em>Touhou</em> is actually <em>not particularly hard</em> compared to other games that would fit this entry.

And then, when you beat the game, you unlock another full set of levels as a "hard mode" of sorts, where the rise in difficulty continues almost-uninterrupted (level 51 is easy, as there's really no way they could have made level 1 hard).

You have to keep your fuel up as high as you can by hitting balloons to regain some, while avoiding obstacles that take away some and objects that kill you in one hit. If you run out of fuel, you won't die instantly, but you won't be able to fly anymore. The first ten or so levels (of 47) aren't too terrible and are even the level of easiness you would expect in a kids' game, but the difficulty goes through the roof after that. Objects eventually start to fly in all directions, some fly the other direction, others change direction mid-flight, and some will just suddenly fly at you for no reason at all. Oh yeah, you only get three lives to make it through this too, which is painful because the later levels are <em>long</em>. Thankfully it is possible to save anywhere you want to, but if you really don't feel challenged enough, you can also try the recycled version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuttPutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuttPutt">Putt-Putt</a> &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FattyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FattyBear">Fatty Bear</a>'s Activity Pack</em>, which ups the ante even <em>more</em>. There are now 75 levels instead of 47, and <em>no ability to save!</em> You can skip by 16-level increments depending on which of the four difficulties you pick, but no continues otherwise. Seriously, when did they expect kids to make it through this?

Just getting into orbit around your home planet, a trivial task in most space games, is surprisingly difficult—an actual astronaut and engineer <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHjaqeeoAKk">tried to do it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with help from an experienced player, and <em>still</em> failed the first couple of times.

You think you are going to have 6 rhythm games in one right? Well, after just about 3 rhythm games you played, you're wrong, as the screen goes to black and has the message saying "Faster!". Now that is when things start to get really tough.
</li><li> The art-style for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleCats">The Battle Cats</a></em> is cartoony, you control an army of cute cats and characters who fight other enemies with said cartoony art-style and the Google Play Store even lists this game in the "Casual" genre. How hard can it be? To keep it brief, if you don't use the correct cats and don't create a solid strategy, then you will be overrun by the many, <strong>many</strong> stages that use and, in some of them, spam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>, most of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">Degraded Bosses</a> who usually avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">Villain Forgot to Level Grind</a>, like no tomorrow.
</li><li> <em>Overcooked!</em> may have a cute and cartoony art style and easy to pick-up controls, but easy is it not. You're constantly trying to send out orders as quickly as possible. Between prep work, cooking, sending out dishes, and then cleaning the dirty plates (not to mention stage gimmicks!), this turns a simple time-management cooking game into a chaotic co-op experience that is <em>demanding</em> with coordination between you and your friends.

To be fair, it was based on a desire to be a televised version of a mid-80s fantasy RPG, and as such a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> is to be expected...but to the point that there are still debates, by fans of the show who are now adults, as to what the correct solution to some of the challenges was? And riddles that required surprisingly in-depth knowledge of Arthurian legend?
<ul><li> One set of winners was even invited onto <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter">Blue Peter</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">long-running</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagazineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagazineShow">Magazine Show</a> that aired on the competing BBC1. <em>That</em> is how much of an event it was.
</li></ul></li><li> Another kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a>; <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eliminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eliminator">Eliminator</a></em>. The Easy questions were your typical kids TV fare. Your Normal questions were hard for a kids gameshow, but not too bad since the kids got to choose what difficulty level of question to answer based on the category...the hard questions, on the other hand, would be considered at the very least tricky on an adult gameshow. Arguably justified by the fact the top prize was a Safari, and kids could quit before answering hard pointers (which became almost a requirement to stay in the game), but to the point that adult gameshow fans have stated that they would only go for hard in categories they're extremely strong (...And, at that, reluctantly) in unless they absolutely have to - assuming they were on an adult adaptation of the show that kept the same (non-relative) question difficulty?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple">Legends of the Hidden Temple</a></em>. The final temple run didn't <em>look</em> that hard, as long as the kid was in decent shape. It was a maze of 12 rooms, each of which had some minor task to do, which ranged from laughably easy (The Throne of the Pretender was <em>sit on the throne</em>,) to kind of difficult (The Shrine of the Silver Monkey was a three-piece puzzle, which seems to stump everyone.) However, the show had a less than 25% success rate. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallMaster">Temple Guardians</a>, that's why. 3 were placed in random rooms and there was no indication as to where or when they would pop up. Usually, they were unavoidable, regardless of what path you took. Sometimes you would even be caught by one in the unskippable first room. Basically, if you didn't earn all those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp">Pendants of Life</a> in the challenges, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">and the path you chose just happened to go past 2 or 3 guardians</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">failure would be the only possible outcome for your team.</a>
<ul><li> Another one was the Jester's Court - that wasn't a very fair task, because you could see people having an easy time with it, but that was because they had to hit all the buttons at once; and that wasn't easy if you were short.
</li></ul></li><li> The final round ("Let's go to the map!") on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego">Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego</a></em> actually had its difficulty ramped up as the show ran on, because too many kids were winning and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a> couldn't afford to keep paying for trips. Seven countries in 45 seconds, not too bad. Eight cities or bodies of water in 45 seconds? Considerably worse. Not to mention that the map tended to be someplace unfamiliar to American audiences like Africa, and it was <em>upside-down</em> from the contestant's perspective.
<ul><li> Don't forget that the contestant had to wait until the host completed reading his question before running over to the proper location. Often, these were long questions, and even if he read them fast they took upwards of 5 seconds to finish. Thus, there were many instances in which a contestant was very fast and perfect about each location, but still lost because the host took too long in his part. Often, the bonus round was humanly impossible to complete.
</li><li> Although they took the long readings out after a season or two. Eventually he would just say "Carmen went to Zaire".
<ul><li> The final round of the spinoff, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTimeIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTimeIsCarmenSandiego">Where In Time Is Carmen Sandiego</a></em>, was <em>even worse</em>. The final mission was "The Trail of Time." Roughly, the kids had to run from one gate to the next, answering questions or performing a small but time-consuming task (turn a wheel, pull a rope.) The questions were long (albeit rather simple, usually a two-choice multiple choice.) But the tasks were time-consuming and, probably the worst offender, the gates were not in order, rather just jumbled around. Even with the Engine Crew waving with airport flashlights, kids kept going to the wrong gates.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This was the entire point of the show <em>Trapped</em>. In each challenge, the contestants (known as Unfortunates) would attempt to complete a simple challenge, such as assembling a wall or filling a goblet with snow. However, in each round, a saboteur was chosen from among the remaining Unfortunates in secret with their goal being to mess with the challenge in some way, such as knocking down the tower when a blackout strikes or purposefully stepping on the ground to tip the goblet over. It's no surprise that some challenges were never beaten during the run of the show, especially in the two examples mentioned as they didn't end when the task was completed (instead, they had to be complete when the timer ran out).
<ul><li> However, being a saboteur wasn't as easy as it sounds; they had to make sure the challenge was failed without the team realising who the saboteur was. If the team beat a challenge or if the saboteur was spotted, they were eliminated from the game (the same would happen to another Unfortunate if the saboteur succeeded at both of these).
</li></ul></li><li> Teams on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, even those who have been fans of the series for years, have finished the first leg in shock of how difficult the Race actually is. This could be in part that, while very little of the travel portions are shown on TV, teams can sometimes spend hours looking for flights to their next destination, and all the sitting around and waiting doesn't help either.
</li><li> National spelling bees.They're spelling bees. For kids. The contestants are all middle-schoolers. Wait, is... is that word even English? Is it even a <em>word?</em> Holy shit, <em>did that thirteen-year-old kid actually get it right?!</em>
<ul><li> The movie <em>Spellbound</em> and the book <em>American Bee</em> both establish just how much training it takes to get far in those things. Essentially, you have to develop monomania for words.
</li></ul></li><li> Katamino and its derivatives. Look at those colorful pentominos. Now try to form a 5x9 rectangle with them.
</li><li> Pretty much any Quiz and Stunt Game Show. Most think it can be a walk in the park to easily beat something you can trounce through easily with your skill and knowledge. It isn't, especially if they give out big money, especially in front of millions of viewers, and especially if those millions of viewers could put you in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> montage if you fail horribly. Naturally, these kinds of shows are made to be as difficult as possible so that the show doesn't have to constantly pay out the nose for prizes won every single day.
</li><li> Eating competitons count also. It sounds easy because all you have to do is eat, which is what many people can do effortlessly. However, the catch is that you have to eat the most food in a short amount of time. If you've eaten fast or so much food before, you know it's not comfortable to shove up food and swallow it quickly, with so much food in your stomach already.
</li><li> When you watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> on TV, it looks somewhat easy for what they're doing. I mean, a kid can do this, right? Well, when you watch it on the TV, you're well fed, well rested, see what's going on in the other camp, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> catches many people off guard when they become contestants on the show. People tend to think the show is easy (probably because they can easily look up prices of products through Google as the show is playing on TV) and how they would never make the same stupid mistakes people on the show do. It isn't until you get to actually play the games on the show that you are under the pressure of guessing the general price range of a car with a limited amount of chances or trying to correctly guess the prices of four prizes in a strict time limit while running around on stage with the price tags in your hands. The more focused contestants tend to do better than the ones who let their excitement take control.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wipeout2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wipeout2008">Wipeout (2008)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TakeshisCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TakeshisCastle">Takeshi's Castle</a></em>. It looks <em>really</em> fun... but damn are they hard! These obstacle courses take a lot more stamina and luck than one thinks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em> as well as its variants (<em>Plus</em>, <em>Super</em> and <em>Million Dollar</em>). As lampshaded by Ludden, it's harder than it looks. Because you see the word written <em>right in front of you</em>, many people accidentally read the word by mistake. This is very similar to the Stroop effect.
</li><li> Fast Money in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>. Sure you can't help but laugh or facepalm when someone says a stupid answer to a question with an obvious number one answer. But when you actually play for yourself, you realize you only get <em>four seconds</em> per question. The tight time constraint can really make it hard to focus and come up with logical answers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> once said that synchronized swimming is the easiest sport in the world. After being invited to a swim meet with them, he said that it was the hardest sport in the world.
</li><li> Open-book tests can be <em>merciless</em> if you're not prepared. Some are designed so there isn't enough time to skim notes and books for all the answers, while some compensate for the available notes by being so advanced or in-depth that even with them it's hard. Also, go ahead and ask a trademan how easy tests involving the National Building or Electrical Code can be, where finding some of the obscure or oddly worded code references can be downright <em>brutal</em>.
</li><li> In-universe example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E47FuzzyPuppyBuddies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E47FuzzyPuppyBuddies">Fuzzy Puppy Buddies</a>"; The Fuzzy Puppies board game is implied to be a lot more sophisticated and difficult to learn than the name and theme suggest. The playing pieces are adorable puppy figures that each have their own unique ability, they can be equipped with cute hats that also bestow different abilities, you need to have a balance of enforcers, decoys, and support puppies on your team to play it well, the playing board is a hex-grid, and a 20-sided die is involved.
</li><li> Hilariously used in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd">xkcd</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/70/">strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent"><em>When I'm in a rock band, I'm gonna do a cool, mellow song. Then in the middle I'll stop, announce "this part is just to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">asshole</a> to people playing </em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a><em>," and then flail wildly on the strings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">for 30 seconds</a>.</em>

"The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier" is one of the few tales narrated from Holmes's first-person perspective, apparently after Watson got a bit fed up with this and challenged Holmes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter">Let's See YOU Do Better!</a>, and it opens with Holmes conceding that taking one of his investigations and turning it into a narrative people are actually interested to read is actually harder than he gave Watson credit for.
</li><li> Flat stages of major road bicycle races like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a> can sometimes be this. Generally they are considered the easier stages to finish decently in, and also come down to a bunch sprint at the finish line. However, strong crosswinds on the route have the capability of splitting the peleton into two or more groups of riders, leaving general classification contenders or sprinters caught behind the split suddenly in trouble. Also, generally flat stages with a tricky finish (tight turns, significant slopes, or other difficulties) can throw off pure sprinters before the finish line, leaving more technical riders (who can deal with the difficulties) to vie for the finish.
