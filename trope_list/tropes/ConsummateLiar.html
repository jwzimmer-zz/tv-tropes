</p><p></p><ul><li> Just Too Alien: An entire race of people (usually aliens) just happen to be immune to whatever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Living Lie Detector</a>'s ability is. Often not quite as disastrous as the lone exceptional Consummate Liar, because once you figure out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Ferengi</a> are immune to your telepathy, you quit trying to use it on them to gather information. Note that being immune to one type of truth-telling might not make a race immune to ALL types (just because you can resist telepathy doesn't mean you can necessarily resist some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerum">Truth Serum</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Truth Twister</a>: A group of beings with the unusual reputation of being "unable to tell a lie." This is usually interpreted by the group as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">unable to tell a LITERAL lie</a>" — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">violating the spirit of the rule</a> is just fine if you can get away with it. This usually renders them immune to most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Living Lie Detector</a> abilities, but it doesn't help them for long, as they quickly develop a reputation for being able to lie without lying, resulting in no one believing ANYTHING they say. (However, the <em>really</em> tricky ones can exploit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">even that</a>.) Examples include the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Aes Sedai</a>, and the ability of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea">Earthsea dragons</a> to lie in the True Speech (which is supposed to be impossible, but they manage). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Vulcans</a> are often thought to fall into this category, but in fact, they can lie; they just strongly prefer not to. When confronted with evidence of having told an untruth, the typical Vulcan response is, "I exaggerated." Liar!

In those tropes, the would-be liar must convince themselves that they are telling the truth. The Consummate Liar knows perfectly well that they are lying. May or may not actually admit, later, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I Lied</a>.

As Akari mentions to him, he's becomes so good at obfuscating the truth for his own benefit that he's managed to convince himself of a number of his own lies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime">Akagami no Shirayukihime</a></em>'s Obi lies constantly in a joking manner, to the point that even after serving Zen and Shirayuki for years Shirayuki still thinks "Obi" is his name and when he mentions things about his past no one considers that they might be true. He does not lie to Zen when the situation is serious, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has Sosuke Aizen, a guy who's so much of a liar that his Zanpakuto (a sword shaped by your own traits) centers around illusion. He'll lie about what sort of person he is; he spent at least a century posing as a kind, mild-mannered Captain when he was pretty much the exact opposite. He'll lie about how much he knows; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he claims that he'd lost track of the Hogyoku because it was hidden in Rukia, but it was BECAUSE she had the Hogyoku that he arranged that whole Ichigo and Fishbone D with her.</span> He'll lie about what he needs certain assets for; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he made it seem like he kidnapped Orihime for the sake of awakening the Hogyoku, when the significance of her power was really just bait to divide his enemy's forces AND lead Ichigo into some more leveling-up.</span> He'll even lie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to his own dang self; when Ichigo showed up with super strength but no perceivable reiatsu, he deluded himself into thinking he'd somehow traded reiatsu for physical strength... even though this makes absolutely no sense, because reiatsu and physical strength are the SAME THING for spirits (and sadly, even many readers bought this one).</span> It's when he starts this last type of lying that he reaches his downfall.

<ul><li> Lelouch Lamperouge/Vi Britannia. While a lot of his lies and secrets <em>do</em> eventually get found out, he still manages to be incredibly convincing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of the series, he's lying to <em>the entire world</em></span>. There is only ONE person who he never lies to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(C.C.)</span> in the entire anime.
</li><li> Schneizel is a consummate Truth Twister, which becomes brutally evident <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he turns the Black Knights against Lelouch</span>.

<ul><li> Although it isn't emphasized, Hei is a <em>really</em> good liar. Watching the first two episodes in particular when you already know what he's like is a little awe-inspiring; Huang chalks it up to characteristic Contractor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a>. ("You people don't give a shit about what you're doing.") And later, as part of a security check, he was questioned while rigged up to a lie detector; one of the questions was, "Do you know any Contractors?" "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">No</a>." He passed.
</li><li> All Contractors seem good at this. It is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the finale by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hei once more, when it is implied that <em>he has had normal human emotions the whole time, and the "contractor" persona was the lie</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: With Light Yagami's track record, the only way to keep this entry to a reasonable length would be to list only the characters he failed to fool completely. You can count them on one hand: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">L, Rem, Mello, and Near. Additionally, Aizawa, Ide and Mogi too become suspicious of Light, but only after Near has manipulated them and revealed the secret of the fake <em>Death Note</em> rules.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>, lying is second nature to Suneo. He literally cannot go a day without lying about something, which bites him in the ass when he is given a device from Doraemon's fourth-dimensional pocket of futuristic gadgets that makes all his lies true.
</li><li> A general rule of thumb when dealing with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>'s resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">Knowledge Broker</a>, Izaya Orihara, is that any information he gives you for free is liable to be a big fat lie. He even lies about his background to his own personal secretary simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">because he can</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:

It soon becomes obvious that the only time this guy comes close to telling the truth is when he's talking about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">Destiny Plan</a> ad even then it's iffy.
</li><li> Loran Cehack, the protagonist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, is a low-key version of this. Guin speculates that Loran is so conscientiously kind and accommodating because he's trying to make up for all the white lies and evasions he employs to keep secret that he's really a Moonrace scout who is trying to defend his Earth friends from the Moon's military forces while simultaneously trying to help the Moonrace achieve its goals of recolonizing Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Itsuwaribito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Itsuwaribito">Itsuwaribito</a></em> gives us Utsuho, whose fighting style combines bombs, poison, knives and lots and lots of lies. He usually wins by tricking his opponents into a situation where they have no choice but to believe him. And once they do, they play into his hands. If this doesn't work, he complicates things by <em>lying about lying</em>. All of the eponymous Itsuwaribito aspire to be this, but many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">claim the title but have few skills to back it up.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDaze">Kagerou Daze</a></em>: Kano, whose eye power is a form of shape-shifting, making lying much easier. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It stems from the fact that he used to hide and lie about the bruises and cuts on his body, to protect his mother's reputation</span>. He lied superfluously for the ensuing decade and seems to have no intention of stopping any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em> pulls off the "lucky liar" feat at a crucial moment or two during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his game of E-Card with Tonegawa</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Ai Hayasaka juggles multiple personalities in- and outside of school, and it's specifically noted that she lies as naturally as she breathes. Kaguya is the only person who knows what Hayasaka is really like. Hayasaka even deceived <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaguya (reluctantly) from the beginning, being forced to spy for Kaguya's eldest brother since she was employed as Kaguya's personal assistant, ten years before the start of the story.</span>
</li><li> Akiyama from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em> does this so well that he can bring down entire corporations. Sure, he got tossed in jail, but still...
</li><li> There is a manga by Iruma Hiruma called <em>Lying Mii-kun And Broken Maa-chan: Precious Lies</em> which tells the gruesome tale of a young boy and girl who get kidnapped 8 years before the main storyline. The title refers to these children, who end up clinging to one another emotionally to survive their horrible ordeal. "Maa-chan" (Mayu Misono) ends up as a mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a> because of the incident, whereas the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">narrator</a> who's only known as "Mii-kun" becomes such a compulsive liar that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> is "That's a lie." He even ends up <em>pointing out that he's lying</em> right after the fact. <em>To the person he just lied to.</em> Apparently there are a couple of people who can <em>sometimes</em> see through his deception, but for the most part, <strong>everyone</strong> is left unsure if what Mii-kun said is anything close to the truth (even his "wife" Maa-chan can't tell, though she claims she can).

Pretty much everything he says is either an outright lie or a rather twisted version of the truth. The only reason that the protagonists bother to listen to him is because he really does have important information, and because one of them is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">mind reader</a> who can confirm his statements.

<ul><li> In Duelist Kingdom he pulls a reverse-bluff against Keith, a guy who pretty much based his whole career on seeing through a poker face. (As in, he sets a Trap Card, tells Keith it's a trap, and hopes he thinks this is an ordinary bluff.) Despite Keith saying it's the "lamest bluff I've ever heard" he still falls for it.

Jonouchi's bluff involves him holding up two cards and telling Johnson to guess which is the Monster card, and reminding him the outcome rests on him getting it right. At first, Johnson <em>does</em> get it right, and actually sees through Jonouchi's "Are you sure?" bluff (commenting that it's one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook">The Oldest Tricks in the Book</a>) at the last second, however, Jonouchi's confidence makes him panic and change his mind; he guesses wrong and loses.

Proving that his true powers is his ability to scam people.
</li><li> The alter-ego of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> is lawyer Matt Murdock. Matt can usually tell when someone is lying by listening to their heartbeat. He agrees to defend an accused man because the man's heartbeat does not change when he claims to be innocent of the crime. Matt successfully defends the man. The man thanks Matt for helping him get away with a crime for which he was actually guilty. Turns out he had a pacemaker so his heartbeat didn't change when Matt questioned him prior to taking him on. This twist was done in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">the movie</a> but with a witness rather than the defendant. For some reason, Matt openly reveals his super-hearing when he ambushes the guy to requestion him and figure out why his heart rate isn't changing. In <em>Daredevil Noir</em> Matt's senses never detect dishonesty from Eliza, and even when he's spying on her, she reads as being uniquely devoid of internal conflict, which turns out to be because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as that continuity's version of Bullseye, she's a sociopath</span>.
</li><li> Two versions of this shows up in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders">Outsiders</a></em> comic. When trying to figure out which of the members is a traitor, Arsenal hooks them up to lie detectors. Nightwing points out that he's more than capable of beating a lie detector (to which Arsenal replies, "Not this one.") and alien member Starfire is completely immune. Arsenal uses his massive connections to procure an alien <em>torture device</em> that he modifies to work as a lie detector. Two other members of the team aren't even questioned because one is a robot and the other doesn't have a bloodstream. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The robot turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> whose "Indigo" personality was a mask; her true self was actually <em>Brainiac</em> version 5.0 from the future</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> once dealt with an elderly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> called the Black Fox who, several times, convinced the hero to let him go, promising to go straight if he spared him (usually by saying he was too old to survive incarceration). He never kept this promise, and Spidey fell for it several times. The Fox was a pretty convincing liar in other ways too, able to convince the landlord owners of fancy penthouses that he was a relative of the tenants, letting him stay there when the actual tenants were out of town. Eventually, it took a sort of vision involving his Uncle Ben (hard to explain) for him to realize he was seeing the Fox as a phony "father figure" and was subconsciously afraid of his disproval. After a dangerous situation where the Fox had stolen a gemstone belonging to Doctor Doom's mother (with the furious Doom coming to get it back) Spidey finally stopped believing his lies and <em>did</em> turn him in.

On the other hand, it also makes it <em>really</em> easy for Daredevil to identify Batman's secret identity, as his heartbeat is described as "wardrum" and slightly slower than it should be.
</li><li> There was also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">The Trial of Venom</a></em> a crossover between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>. Eddie Brock's symbiote seemed to have died, and Eddie convinced everyone - psychologists, polygraph operators, and even Matt (who was acting as his lawyer) that it was dead and he was no longer a threat. Matt even managed to get him acquitted and released on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a> applied here.) In truth, the symbiote was inside his body, keeping him calm and controlling his vital signs to fool the polygraph and even Matt's super-sensitive hearing, without even <em>knowing</em> that Matt was Daredevil. He might never had been found out unless a still-suspicious Spidey decided "just to make sure", and provoked a heated argument with Eddie, making him angry until the symbiote emerged and he gave himself away.

He's literally so good that he can manipulate a person when they know who he is, that he's evil, and that he's probably manipulating them and shouldn't be trusted.

<ul><li> Garak has a natural gift for obfuscation, views it as a skill that requires constant practice and once claimed "the truth is often an excuse for a lack of imagination". He may or may not be an exiled spy and, while he was definitely exiled by his boss, the reason may or may not have been for killing a Gul's daughter, or letting Bajoran prisoners escape, or tax evasion, or something else. When Bashir tells him the story of The Boy who Cried Wolf, Garak interprets the moral as being "never tell the same lie twice". The only person capable of seeing through Garak is Odo; he works out that when Garak answers a question simply and without embellishment, he's telling the truth. After that, his instinct for knowing when Garak is lying or telling the truth becomes quite sharp.

He is, as a result, extremely adverse to answering with a simple yes or no, or if he does deign to give a straight answer, he often says, "Yes... and no," followed by his usual verbose rhetoric when asked for clarification.

<ul><li> The Bard class in 3.5th Edition has access to the spell Glibness at level 7. The sheer degree to which it improves the user's ability to lie borders on mind control, considering that it grants a +30 bonus on such checks in a system where "By the way, your Majesty, I'm actually your trueborn son and heir, hidden from you at birth by your treacherous adviser" would be, at most (even if you are a female from a completely different non-cross-fertile species), a -20 penalty, for a net bonus of +10. Oh, and it can fool magical lie detection. The <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> games patch this bug in the system by shifting what the result of a successful bluff actually is— in 3.0/3.5, a successful bluff means the target believes whatever you're telling them. In Pathfinder and most other more recent d20-system games, it simply means that the target accepts your statement as sincere, which is a different matter entirely (instead of believing that you're invisible because you bluffed them, they'll just think you're sincerely nuts). Like many Pathfinder rules, this change was pretty much something everyone in 3.5/3.0 was doing with house rules anyhow.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> campaign, aasimar are descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-celestials</a>, children born from unions of celestial beings and mortals. Most are benign, but those that aren't tend to be excellent liars and con artists. Their Upper Planner ancestry leads most other people to trust them over other people, so they can get away with a lot. (In other words, many aasimar use the reputation of their family to manipulate them. The best way to describe this sort of aasimar is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a>, but one who takes far more initiative on his or her own than most.)

However, it weakens them significantly if their lies are visibly contradicted by hard evidence. Somewhat unusual in that although they can fool their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">opposite numbers</a>, the Seraphim, they are at a significant disadvantage when trying to do so. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">Malakim</a> can recognize them if they're perceptive enough, but are otherwise just as vulnerable as anyone else to their lies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Nobilis</a></em> has Deceivers, a subset of Excrucians whose MO is to employ deception above all else. Their powers vary and GMs are actively encouraged to invent more, but standard ones include impenetrable disguises, the ability to convince a crowd of mundane humans of anything at all, and the ability to tell someone a lie which, whether they believe it or not, renders them incapable of seeing any evidence to the contrary. One canonical Excrucian named Iolithae Septimian, through the wanton abuse of Persona 5 and pseudo-Estate of "The Lies of Iolithae Septimian", is quite literally able to fool <em>reality itself</em> by saying something, then performing a Lesser Sacrifice to remove the quality that makes it a lie. Canonically, she made the ocean salty by telling it that it was; in the Excrucian-centric webcomic Chibi-Ex, written by the creator of <em>Nobilis</em>, she uses it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">retroactively cancel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>.

As a result, their physical form has <em>none</em> of those subtle, nonverbal cues people show when they do something that's dissonant with what they think. Unless the Demon wants you to notice, the only way to know whether they're lying or not is to check the facts yourself. They're also immune against even supernatural lie detectors such as Auspex, although via different mechanism: any statements said by demons existed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat">Schrödinger's Cat</a>-like state due to their paradoxical nature until the demon decides if the statement's true or not, regardless of its actual trueness. A demon can say "The sky is purple", decides it's true, and any and all supernatural truth detection (except for a Fractal's ability) cannot see through the lies, period.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em>, demons lie like they breathe, and no mundane or magical means can detect whether or not they're telling the truth. This is because Truth is a virtue that, as beings of pure evil, they don't possess and can't understand — which also makes it quite easy to lie <em>to</em> them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt Engarde</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Justice For All</a></em>. Phoenix asks him if he committed murder. He didn't, so the Magatama didn't show any Psyche-Locks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, he is guilty of hiring an assassin to do the job</span>.
</li><li> There's one instance where breaking a Psyche-Lock with the Magatama yields Phoenix information which turns out to be completely wrong. It's hard to say, though, whether this is an example of this trope or whether it's a mistake from the Magatama.
</li><li> In note to the two examples above, on both occasions the "lies" managed to slip past the Magatama due to a flaw in the Magatama's system. The Magatama isn't a pure lie detector but rather tells it's user when a person "is holding a secret in their heart". To this effect, a person can themselves believe a lie to be a true and the Magatama wouldn't react to it. This is what happened in the first example; he believed his statement of "I never killed anyone" to be true because he's an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a> who genuinely thought that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hiring an assassin</span> meant he never killed anyone. It's implied that had he himself believed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hiring a murder meant he was a killer</span> then the Magatama would have picked up the statement as a lie. In the second example, the person lying had become so attached to his lie that he, once again, believed it to be true, thus the Magatama didn't pick up that the info gained was all lies. It's not until court where Phoenix <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"reveal's" said person made up identity that he starts to snap out of believing that he reality was this identity.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em>, the "Mood Matrix" used by Athena Cykes can detect a person's emotional stability when giving testimony and allow her to read into their real emotions to pick apart lies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the final case, she uses this against rival prosecutor Simon Blackquill, whose testimony is the only time that the Mood Matrix picks up an <em>increase</em> in emotional disturbance over the course of the testimony (normally it drops the more you probe the witness's testimony for emotional inconsistency). Simon doesn't shake his facial expression during this period and his lies are perfectly believable, so the only way you know that his lies are just getting stronger as he testifies is by the Mood Matrix.</span>

At one point, he actually has to lie to some animals using phlebotinum that allows them to talk. Despite being living lie detectors, he still fools them. That said, some of the lies he tells are so ridiculous that it doesn't really matter how perfect his poker face is.

Later events reveal that Tarvek has been able to keep some major lies running for <em>years</em>.
