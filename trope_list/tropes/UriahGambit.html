</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> Yang Wenli of the Free Planets Alliance was given the mission of taking the impregnable Iserlohn fortress with half a fleet after opposing the Patriotic Corps. Not only it fails, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he succeeds without losing a single soldier</span>.
</li><li> Happens to Reinhard twice, courtesy of fleet admiral Gregor von Mückenberger and his belief that Reinhard got his rank only because his sister was the Emperor's favorite concubine:
<ul><li> During the Fourth Battle of Tiamat in the first movie Mückenberger sent his fleet out to the front of the battle unsupported, then gave the rest of his force orders to not worry about hitting friendlies when the shooting started. Just to make this clear, he was willing to kill over a thousand of <em>his own ships</em> and their crews just to see Reinhard dead. Just like Yang, Reinhard not only survives but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns it around on him and becomes crucial to the Imperial victory</span>.
</li><li> The first battle of the series, the Battle of Astarte, had Mückenberger deprive him of most of his talented sub-commanders, and then send him into battle and arrange for the enemy to find out he's coming so they'll send a much larger fleet to stop him. After Reinhard not only wins but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">inflicts the Alliance ten times the casualties he suffered and comes very close to annihilate the enemy forces</a>, Mückenberger realizes what kind of genius he's dealing with and makes sure to not be in the way when Reinhard starts his political ascension, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">insuring his own survival when Reinhard takes over the Empire and other High Nobles try and fail to stop him</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the 2003 anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lior's Destruction by Scar's Philosopher's Stone Array</span> and Alphonse telling to Roy that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fuhrer King Bradley is a Homunculus</span>, the main villain has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride</span> send Roy, his squad and Armstrong to another war, so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the homunculi</span> can shoot them during the battle and blame it on their enemies.
</li><li> Happens more than once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, with the most spectacular case being the <em>Diplomat Murder Case</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The villain, Isao, fancied a lady named Kimie, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to Isao's rival Yamashiro. So Isao used Yamashiro as a scapegoat in a fraud (with help of his father Toshimitsu), waited until poor Yamashiro died in prison, and then went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortingTheWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComfortingTheWidow">Comforting the Widow</a> on Kimie.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TsutomuNihei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TsutomuNihei">Tsutomu Nihei</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KnightsOfSidonia">Knights of Sidonia</a></em> revolves around one long Uriah Gambit against the protagonist Tanikaze. The ship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">Omniscient Council of Vagueness</a> doesn't like that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">naturally immortal</span> and wants to get rid of him, so they send him out on <em>every</em> mission that comes up hoping he'll get killed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Of course</a>, this swiftly leads to Tanikaze becoming one of the most skilled and experienced soldiers on the ship, far too valuable to conveniently dispose of. Eventually he's being sent on dangerous missions not as an attempt to get him killed, but because he's the only one skilled enough to possibly succeed.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> actually displays a rare example of this being from the heroes side. The Federation refuses to send more soldiers to aid the White Base, the ship the protagonists reside on and composed primarily of rookie soldiers and civilians, because of the ships' growing reputation during the War. They find that the White Base is the perfect decoy to distract Zeon from what the rest of Federation is up to.
</li><li> Happens several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em>, the most notable being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeheart</span> refusing to send reinforcements to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Decil</span>, leaving him fight the Gundam on his own. This is a rare instance when the David seems justified, however, as the Uriah had repeatedly demonstrated self-centered insubordination, which had directly lead to the death of several squadmates, so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeheart</span> can plausibly claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">I Did What I Had to Do</a> to his subordinates.
</li><li> A large-scale version of this happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> at the Battle of JOSH-A, halfway through the series. While the top brass of the Earth Alliance come from the Atlantic Federation, the military as a whole is pretty evenly split between them and the Eurasian Federation. At JOSH-A, the Atlantic Federation sets up a highly effective trap, sacrificing their main headquarters by self-destructing it on top of a massive ZAFT invasion force.

<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">named for an incident</a> where, desiring Uriah's gorgeous wife Bathsheba, King David <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">had him sent into battle as cannon fodder</a>. David had first slept with Bathsheba while her husband was off on the front lines. Then, when David found out he'd gotten Bathsheba pregnant, he tried to cover it up. The first coverup attempt ("Hey, Uriah! Buddy! Doin' a great job as an officer, my man! As a reward, I'm gonna give you a little vacation. Here, have a drink... or two or three... now go home, relax, enjoy an evening with your wife. You've earned it!") failed because Uriah <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst">refused to accept privileges that his men weren't being allowed</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker">even after David got him drunk</a>). Being unable to explain away Bathsheba's pregnancy the normal way, David pulled the Uriah Gambit as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">probably spur-of-the-moment</a> backup plan. Joab, the general David gave the order to (who also knew what David had done), was forced to put all of his troops within arrow range, then pull all of them but Uriah back, to make sure Uriah was killed. In a passive aggressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>, Joab returned to Jerusalem to say something along the lines of: "<em>The deed is done. Oh, and by the way, here are the names of all of the</em> other <em>guys who had to die by your strategy for no reason</em>." David <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">still married Bathsheba</a>. As punishment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> cursed David's house with war and public shame, and his child from adultery was struck with a terrible illness, dying shortly after birth. (They later had another son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfKings">Solomon</a>.) Said war and shame also resulted in the death of two of David's sons (they were both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">monsters</a>, but David was still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">very torn up about it</a>).
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a>, in the Tanakh this also happens and is considered what ultimately dooms the Davidic line at the cosmological level, thus dooming Jewish sovereignty and independence altogether.
</li></ul></li><li> Earlier in 1 Samuel, David was on the receiving end of this, when seeking the hand of King Saul's daughter Michal in marriage. Saul, who didn't like David and saw him as a threat to his authority (especially after that whole Goliath thing), but couldn't kill or banish David because he was charismatic and popular (especially after that whole Goliath thing), sent David on a number of impossible missions from which Saul did not expect David to return. Inevitably, David survived, often doing <em>more</em> than Saul requested (for instance, in the famous quest to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">100 foreskins of the Philistines</a>—which meant "fight 100 Philistines, kill them, and <em>disfigure their corpses</em>", not exactly an easy task—David took <em>200</em>), much to Saul's chagrin. Eventually, Saul just gave up and let David marry Michal.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> has many examples of this.
<ul><li> The myth of Perseus killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">Medusa</a> happened because the King of Serifos, Polydectes, ordered him to do it so he could marry Perseus' mother Danae while he was away. Polydectes believed slaying Medusa was impossible, so he thought Perseus would either die trying or exile himself in shame. Backfires massively when Perseus, after killing Medusa and rescuing the princess Andromeda, learns that Polydectes has snagged Danae, thus he rushes back home to save his mom and turns Polydectes and his court to stone by way of Medusa's head as punishment.
</li><li> Bellerophon refuses the advances of the queen of Tiryns, who then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseRapeAccusation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseRapeAccusation">tricks her husband Proetus into believing that Bellerophon has tried to rape her</a>. Bound by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> not to kill his guest, Proetus sends Bellerophon to his father-in-law Iobates, King of Lycia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseShootTheMessenger">bearing a missive asking Iobates to kill its bearer</a>.

Instead, Iobates repeatedly sends Bellerophon on suicidal missions, like slaying the Chimera, where he continuously succeeds.
</li><li> Most of Hercules' Labors were attempts to get him killed.

The labor of cleaning the Augean Stables (which had never been cleaned since <em>ever</em>) was unique in that it was meant to humiliate Hercules instead of kill him. Backfired when Hercules <em>diverted a river into the Stables</em>.
<ul><li> Though that backfired on Hercules, since technically the river did the cleaning for him, so it didn't count, so he had another labor added.
</li><li> Other sources claim it didn't count not because of the river, but because he took payment from King Augeas for doing it, making it employment and not labour.

The Fleece rests in Colchis (modern day Georgia) with plenty of life-threatening obstacles in the way.

So they butchered him, brought the pieces to Medea, and found she had thrown away the potion</span> at which point Jason renounces the throne and leaves for exile with his wife.
</li><li> With the existing sources of <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em>, we're presented with a story of how mortal desires can destroy nations when, in order to solve the problem of a golden apple inscribed with "For the fairest," the mortal Trojan prince Paris is asked to decide who of the three candidates—Aphrodite, Athena, or Hera—deserved it and they each incentivized themselves with different rewards if he chose them. In the end, Paris chooses Aphrodite when she offers him the hand of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen. Who happens to already be married to Menelaus, King of Sparta, and this results in the ten-year Trojan War, the deaths of tons of people, and the total destruction of the city of Troy. Among those dead are many, many demigod children of various Olympians. This all just sounds like a big tragedy until you learn about some of the lost epics which are also part of the Trojan Cycle: in truth, the entire conflict was orchestrated by Zeus in an effort to cull part of humanity as a whole and the demigods in particular for fear that they would rise up and overthrow him. It worked.

<ul><li> In the game itself, the Space Wolves have a unit called the "Lone Wolf", a cheap but powerful character who will give the opponent a victory point if he <em>survives</em> the battle. As a result, the basic strategy for Lone Wolves is to deliberately throw them at the enemy in the hopes that they die taking down as many enemies as possible, or at the very least drawing their fire.
</li><li> Also from the Space Wolves, whose melee/fast assault troops (Bloodclaws, Skyclaw jetpack and Swiftclaw bikers) are the youngest warriors, still full of enthusiasm and recklessness which causes them to clash with higher-ups. Thus they end up in death-or-glory missions where many die... to mutual satifaction.

If you fail the Lion Clan spectacularly enough that your death is required, but not so monstrously that immediate seppuku is the only way you'll exonerate your kin from being shadowed by your shame, you can join this unit. They intentionally rush the best of the Lion's enemies at the beginning of battle. Almost certain to kill them (and if it doesn't kill a particular Death Seeker, he/she will just prepare a <em>new</em> Uriah Gambit for theirself after the battle), but also certain to take a sizable chunk out of said best of the enemies.

While Nye has never lost a case, he tends to drive the Guvners at the Courthouse up the wall, and they often assign him to defend criminals sent to the Dustmen's Court of Woe, hoping he won't come back. (The Court of Woe is a "service" rendered to the Guvners where petty criminals are sometimes sentenced to help deal with the backlog, and it is a hellish place overseen by the demonic Judge Gabberslug. While Gabberslug <em>technically</em> isn't allowed to sentence defendants to death, that occasionally happens to folks in the court, defendant or otherwise, that annoy him.) Unfortunately, it never works the way the Guvners intend. Gabberslug, being from the Abyss, appreciates Nye's grasp on Chaos, and is usually pleased when he shows up.

<ul><li> The 444th's AWACS "Bandog" invokes this on one mission: There's a certain pilot who's gotten his hands on some secure Osean intel, the kind that gets entire squadrons executed for viewing without authorization. This would be all well and good if he could just keep a low profile about it, but then he goes and implicates his <em>entire fucking squadron</em> by openly bragging about it over the radio, even after Bandog warns him numerous times that he's treading a very thin and dangerous line. So to save his own ass and the asses of the rest of Spare, Bandog tags the loudmouth pilot as an enemy during a lapse in reliable IFF, and gets him killed in the crossfire.

</li><li> If the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> title you're playing doesn't allow you to change your faction heir, this is almost guaranteed to come up at least once a campaign. Disloyal generals can be bribed with wives and titles, but your unruly sons can't, and trying to have them assassinated may be too risky. Or maybe medieval inbreeding has left a character with a host of negative traits that you don't want contaminating your family line. In any case, these unwanted characters and their bodyguards function best as disposable heavy cavalry - either they'll die a "glorious" death on the battlefield, or somehow survive and pick up traits to make them even <em>better</em> disposable heavy cavalry. If you're Catholic, you can even use them to show the Pope how dedicated you are to his latest stupid crusade by martyring your "beloved" son to the cause.
</li><li> The position of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">the Arbiter</a> is used as such by the Prophets when a particular Elite gains too much prestige or political power, or alternatively commits a heinous offense while remaining too useful to simply execute. The position is itself a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteElephant">White Elephant</a>; the role of Arbiter is the right hand of the Covenant religion as a whole, wielding enormous power during times of great strife, and can restore the honor of an otherwise disgraced Elite - but the events that they are called into service for are so great that they WILL inevitably kill the Arbiter in question. As the Prophet of Truth states, they are "created and consumed in times of extraordinary crisis".
<ul><li> In a bit of a twist, the fact that the position of Arbiter is an Uriah Gambit isn't hidden from the one chosen during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2's</a> events at all. It's bluntly stated to his face that he is expected to take the mantle and die as an alternative form of execution for his failure in letting Halo be destroyed. In a further twist, not only is he the only one to NOT die during his time as the Arbiter, but he in fact outlives the entire Covenant religion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">as well as the Prophets</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">who called for his execution in the first place.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions">Dominions</a></em> has no way to disband a unit, and your units cost you full upkeep even when injury or disease renders them useless. Players will often send the expensive, feeble-minded old wizard on a suicide charge into the nearest enemy territory to get them out of the roster. Just send the player you're "attacking" a note; they'll understand.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft</a></em>, Mengsk sends Kerrigan to hold off the Protoss during a Zerg invasion, and when the Zerg begin to overwhelm the Terrans and Protoss alike he abandons her. It's implied the reason he did this was because she and Raynor were beginning to get a bit too defiant to his increasingly extreme methods. Works outside the game reveal that another reason was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she was one of the Ghosts that murdered his family. Kerrigan in particular was the one who beheaded his father Angus Mengsk.</span>
<ul><li> Oh no, the Zerg just put a parasite on one of my easy-to-replace marines! That means they'll be able to spy on me and track my army's movements as long as he's alive! On a related note, we need someone to head into the enemy base so we can scout their troop composition. Any volunteers?
</li><li> Also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em> multiplayer games. If you get to extreme late game you might end up with more workers than you really want to have and you want that population cap freed up for more combat units. So from starting off as a valuable part of your forces they become a nuisance. Solution? Charge unwanted workers at the enemy ahead of your main army. That way it ensures they die to free up your population whilst simultaneously soaking up some of the enemy fire which would otherwise be targetted at your army. Even more viable with Zerg given how fast their tech switches can happen. It's not uncommon for a Zerg player to simply attack-move suicide "useless" units or even his entire army into an opponent with the aim of deliberately getting them all killed whilst doing as much damage as possible in order to be able to completely rebuild an army from scratch to take advantage of weaknesses in the opponent's composition.

In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft">WarCraft</a> III</em> expansion <em>The Frozen Throne</em>, the blood elves fall under the command of a racist human general named Garithos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">who abhorred any non-human race</a> but had a special place in his heart for the elves due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">believing them to be responsible for failing to protect his family's lands</a> during the Second War. As such, when Kael came under his command, Garithos went out of his way to give Kael the most menial, humiliating tasks he could. When Kael asked for weightier tasks, Garithos gave one to him... in the form of a suicide mission where the blood elves were meant to be nothing but cannon fodder while all Garithos' other forces aided him at the front line. Despite this, Kael and the elves survive, but Garithos sentences them to death anyway for consorting with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">naga</a>, despite the fact they would have died if they didn't. At that point, Garithos admits he never trusted the elves and believed they should have never been accepted into the Alliance, essentially revealing his treatment of them comes from the chip on his shoulder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game centers around B Company, an army company seemingly created for this very purpose and to which the most troublesome members of the Army are sent in the hopes that they get killed in their assigned suicide missions. At the time the game is set, the company consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everyman</a> PC, who took a helicopter for a joyride and crashed it on a general's limo; a cowardly nerd who infected a secure military network with a nasty computer virus after using it to look up porn; an explosion-obsessed redneck who blew up the largest ammo dump east of Paris; and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> sergeant who volunteered for the position in the hopes that it will help him retire faster (service in B Company counts towards discharge faster, so even if they somehow survive their suicide missions the Army will be rid of them soon enough).

He forcibly conscripts them into the Knights, gives them his Pontiff's Left Eye and Right Eye rings, and sends them off on missions in faraway lands. If they aren't killed during the mission, the rings are designed to slowly induce insanity in the wearer and cause their mind to devolve into that of a feral beast, so they won't be able to find their way back. And even if they manage to do <em>that</em>, it seems that given enough time, the rings will cause the wearer to turn into a <em>literal</em> feral beast, since the player obtains the Right Eye not from any of the Outrider Knights encountered during the game, but from killing a large monstrous creature just outside of the city Sulyvahn rules over.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">exact details aren't given</a>, but the general gist is that Tommy Vercetti was sent by Sonny Forelli to kill one man in Harwood, and that one man turned out to be eleven men. While Tommy survived and killed them all, this still worked out for Sonny, as Tommy was jailed for fifteen years over the incident, and his infamy as the "Harwood Butcher" means that once he's released, they have to send him down to Vice City to establish a presence for the Forelli family because he's far too hot to be doing any work in Liberty City.

Yevon let the Al Bhed and Crusaders participate in a full-scale operation to try to take down Sin with Machina in spite of their rather oppressive ban on technology.

The result of this? Many Al Bhed and less conservative Crusaders have died, Machina the Al Bhed could have used to overthrow Yevon has been destroyed, and the very public failure of the operation means that it's reconfirmed Yevonism and Summoner pilgrimages are the only way to destroy Sin. Auron, who knew <em>exactly</em> what the Maesters who allowed this operation to happen were thinking, is absolutely and thoroughly disgusted by the whole ordeal.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode an Earth Kingdom soldier mentions that one way the Fire Nation deals with war prisoners is dressing them up in military uniforms and sending them to the front lines without weapons.
</li><li> There's a good chance Ozai sent Zuko away on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">Snipe Hunt</a> <em>hoping</em> that he would get killed sooner rather than later, so that Ozai could have him out of his hair permanently without getting his hands dirty. Well, dirtier.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Tallest, the leaders of the Irkens, send Zim to "invade" an uncharted area they assume has no planets in it, inhabited or otherwise, because they don't want him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">screwing up any invasions</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">It turns out to be Earth</a>.
</li><li> And in a later episode, they send him to a harsh alien boot camp in the hope that he'll be killed, while at the same time holding a betting pool on how long Zim will last. Not only is Zim the only member of his training unit to survive, but the Tallest end up losing an extremely large amount of money to the one guy they <em>forced</em> to bet more money than he'd ever see in his life on Zim surviving — since they'd lose money if no-one bet for him.
</li><li> In the hour-long special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</a></em> the Tallest decide that they'd rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">blow up the Earth</a> when Zim teleports it into their flight path and finally be rid of him rather than accepting the gift he handed to them on a silver platter.
</li><li> On a similar note, they try doing the same thing to Invader Skoodge, sending him to Blorch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">home of the slaughtering rat-people</a>, because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">too short</a>. Against all odds, he's the first invader to succeed his mission, so he's "rewarded" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">being launched out of a cannon into the planet that he just conquered</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> has Megabyte do this to his own henchmen Hack &amp; Slash because he's sick of their incompetence.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> adaptation of the original Biblical story named <em>King George and the Ducky</em> (needing to be family-friendly) had the gambit carried out because King George wanted Thomas' rubber ducky. Instead of lust over a woman he sees bathing, it's greed over a kid's bath toy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3etns');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3etns" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3etns');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not as creepy as it sounds, as the vegetables don't wear clothes, often.</span> Thomas holds his ground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">and wins the day single-handedly</a>but suffers from some long-term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">severe post-traumatic stress</a>. Granted, he was unlikely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">killed by pies</a> in the first place...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, Starscream does this to two different 'cons. First was Predaking, whom the Decepticons felt was potentially becoming too powerful, especially with the new Predcons coming online. So they opted to get the Autobots to destroy the research facility, and hopefully when Predaking wants revenge, either scraps the Autobots or gets scrapped by the Autobots. This plan has Megatron's full support. However, the second involved him trying to off Shockwave, who, although was his equal in rank, was running the risk of supplanting him, so he sprang the plan without warning Shockwave in the hopes he'd get scrapped (Starscream handwaves this by explaining that he wanted Shockwave's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">reaction to be genuine</a>). Shockwave didn't die, but he was unable to save a lot of data, which could potentially affect his standing with Megatron. The next episode reveals that Shockwave caught on to Starscream's little scheme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">and he wasn't too happy about it,</a> though he accept's Starscream's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">Enforced Method Acting</a> logic.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SherlockHolmesInTheTwentySecondCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SherlockHolmesInTheTwentySecondCentury">Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century</a></em>, "The Crooked Man", is based on the above mentioned literary example. In this case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the gambit involved the man convincing his co-worker to undergo an experimental genetic process they were working on, then sabotaging it, all so he could marry the co-workers fiance. Whether or not he'd hoped it'd kill the co-worker is uncertain, but it did leave the poor guy as a lion/human hybrid who had to hide from society at large.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em>, during a flashback, Grune <em>thinks</em> that King Claudus sent him on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">Snipe Hunt</a> for the Book of Omens because he feared his ambition. Which, in hindsight, wouldn't have been unreasonable since Grune really did try to become king and eventually betrayed the Cats.
</li><li> Homer does this unintentionally to Barney in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Mr. Plow", tricking him into thinking there's a customer on Widows Peak, a large treacherous mountain outside of town, so Barney's out of the way and Homer can plow driveways again. (As underhanded as this was, Barney <em>was</em> being sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in this episode by defaming and slandering Homer in his commercials.) When it does seem like it's about to turn into a <em>real</em> Uriah Gambit (Barney's truck ends up trapped under an avalanche) Homer has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment and drives to the mountain to rescue him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hordak plans to execute Catra, but Entrapta persuades him to spare Catra. Instead, Hordak sends Catra to retrieve First Ones technology in the Crimson Waste and admits to Entrapta that it's a suicide mission.
</li><li> Hordak himself was unsuccessfully subjected to this by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Horde Prime.</span> In a flashback, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Horde Prime sent Hordak to the front lines of battle after Hordak exhibited signs of illness, because Horde Prime despised any flaws in his clones. Hordak was supposed to die in battle, but instead was drawn through a portal and trapped on Etheria.</span>
