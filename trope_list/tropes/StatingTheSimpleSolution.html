<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Sanji's first wanted poster is a comically crude sketch of his face. The pirate Duval, who happens to look just like the sketch, keeps getting into fights because people constantly mistake him for Sanji thanks to the wanted poster. Eventually, Duval tracks Sanji down to get revenge for all the trouble he's been put through. When Sanji asks Duval why he didn't just change his appearance somehow (like getting a haircut), Duval takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">a moment to think</a> before he admits that he never thought of that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> King Cold advises his son Frieza that revenge would be easier by just blowing up the Earth from space. Frieza rejects this notion, stating that he wants to see Goku suffer. One episode later, both Frieza <em>and</em> Cold are killed by Trunks.
</li><li> After being warned from the future that in three years, two androids built by Dr. Gero will murder all of them, Bulma does this when she suggests simply finding out where Dr. Gero is and killing him before he activates the androids. She's promptly shot down because Goku and Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">like the sound of the challenge</a> these androids will bring. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">In some versions</a>, Krillin also tells her in secret that it's best to give former villains Piccolo and Vegeta a mutual enemy. Goku also suggests that since Dr. Gero hasn't built the androids yet, it would be tantamount to killing an innocent person, which he doesn't want to do (of course, he's forgetting that Gero was the lead scientist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">Red Ribbon Army</a>, and so most of their tech was probably built by him). Vegeta, meanwhile, says that even by the time they found Dr. Gero, it would be too late.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> and the subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> adaptation; after being revived, Frieza announces his plan for revenge against Goku. Tagoma, one of his minions, speaks out against it, telling him that he could just go back to ruling his empire in space with Goku and the Z-Fighters never the wiser. In response, Frieza either kills him on the spot (<em>Resurrection 'F</em>') or uses him as his personal training dummy for four months (<em>Super</em>).
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series, Staff Officer Black insists to Commander Red that they're no match for Goku and the smartest thing to do is simply to let him have the Dragon Balls, escape while they can, and rebuild the Red Ribbon Army later. Of course, after killing Red and taking over the army for himself, Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">refuses to take his own advice</a> and tries to beat Goku using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>.

Both of them are severely injured and weakened, and Shishio's 15 minute-time limit for fighting has elapsed. Yumi (Shishio's lover) and Houji (Shishio's right-hand man) are watching, and Houji has a rifle. Yumi asks Houji why he just doesn't shoot Kenshin... Houji <em>throws his gun away</em>, on the grounds of his belief that Lord Shishio will win. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> offers a non-fatal version: when Lelouch learns that his best friend is the pilot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that's thwarted him at every turn, his partner C.C. asks why he doesn't just use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Geass</a> to make said friend join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. She guesses that it's either pride, sentimentality, or distaste for robbing another person of their free will; Lelouch responds that it's all three.
</li><li> At the climax of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeFirstEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeFirstEpisode">Non-Indicative First Episode</a> (filming a movie) of <em>The Melancholy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, Nagato confronts Itsuki, who refuses to join forces with her. Nagato's shoulder-mounted <em>cat</em> suddenly starts <em>talking</em>, asking why she doesn't just use <em>mind control</em> on the guy already, since judging by what she's shown so far it ought to be well within her powers. But that's not in the script, so after a scramble to <em>shut him up</em> Nagato has her final battle with Mikuru.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> inverts the trope — ("No, you can't just shoot him!") — when Sōsuke is challenged to a no-holds-barred martial arts battle and, after being warned by his opponent not to pull any punches, calmly shoots the guy with a rubber bullet. Once it's explained to him that using a gun isn't allowed, he repeats the performance with his next opponent by gassing him with a fire extinguisher — and when it's <em>further</em> explained to him that he's supposed to be fighting <em>solely</em> hand-to-hand, he downs his third opponent via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyCatch">Hey, Catch!</a> with a grenade followed by several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attacks</a>, explaining afterwards that the pin was still in the grenade, and clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">never quite grasping the concept of a "fair fight" at all</a>.

Ling seems to think it's a better idea to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> first, since their enemy clearly outmatches them. Edward would rather go to the point. They share this exchange:

Vamdemon states that it doesn't suit his aesthetic, although there's also the implication that he wanted to feed off of their fear (and their blood). This comes back to bite him in the ass courtesy of Angewomon's Arrow of Light.

His henchmen suggest that he allow them to simply slash Tracy's throat because it would be quieter while being just as effective. However, Flattop overrules them because he prefers to shoot his targets. That proves to be a big mistake when Flattop prepares to do that on a count of three. Tracy lunges toward the killer to seize his gun and a wild battle ensues, where Tracy is able to defeat all the crooks at once, even as his comrades in the force are storming the hideout.

In "Thinking Tactically," a much less emotionally conflicted Katniss Everdeen begins the games, gets to the bow, escapes pursuit, then doubles back and starts firing arrows from the treeline into the general melee at the Cornucopia. A mere five minutes into the Hunger Games, she's whittled the competition down to herself, Petta, Rue, and Foxface.

She's utterly shocked when Saito suggests they simply alter the contract to limit what punishments he can give out and for what reasons.

So in order to prove his point, he staged <em>a fake coup</em>, complete with sending orders to Equestria's armies to muster on the borders of half a dozen neighboring nations. Though this does convince Luna to install some stairs, she does not fall to point out that Quick Fix <em>could have just talked to her about it.</em>

<div class="indent"><strong>Silica</strong>: The power to believe in myself? <br/><strong>Kirito</strong>: <em>No</em> — a knife! Stab it!!
</div></li><li> In Episode 10, one half of Kirito's brain is smart enough to realize that Asuna's surprise adoption of Yui is an attempt to scare him into calling off their rather hasty marriage because she doesn't think it's a good idea either, and all they have to do to resolve the situation is talk things out like adults. It's slapped down by the other half of Kirito's brain, which resolves to play along until <em>she</em> blinks first.
</li><li> At the end of the first season, when Kirito and Asuna learn <em>why</em> Kayaba imprisoned ten thousand people inside a lethal video game - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he created a <em>glitch</em> that killed players when their avatars died, and claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMeantToDoThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IMeantToDoThat">I Meant to Do That</a> because he hadn't slept in 500 hours</span> - Asuna asks why he didn't try to blame hackers impersonating him instead of continuing the charade for two years, given he had no motive.

In that fanfic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> nobles with old claims to demesnes are dusting them off and taking full advantage of an unfair, outdated law that Celestia was trying to have slide into obscurity (although Luna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">torpedoed that by giving Twilight Sparkle the titular demesne</a>)</span>.

<ul><li> Commander Drake asks why Vice Admiral Jonathan hasn't simply shot Terry and Isaiah, to which Jonathan responds that he can't afford the two million beri fine.
</li><li> Drake later asks why the World Government simply doesn't just sic the Admirals, the most powerful fighting force they have, on the Straw Hats. Jonathan responds that it would hurt the World Government either way. If the Admiral wins, the act would be seen as overkill for having to resort to using an Admiral to beat what should be a weak rookie pirate crew, and therefore implicates the World Government as incompetent. However, on the off-chance that the Straw Hats win, it would convince the Warlords to rebel, bringing both them and the Emperors down on the World Government simultaneously. Jonathan thus argues that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">it just isn't worth it either way</a>.

Tywin Lannister and Eddard Stark are all for sending their armies to the Eyrie. Robert Baratheon points out that it would be far easier and cheaper to send some of their men to sneak in and get the two out without calling undue attention.

When Wax discovers a civilization that created armbands that can grant powers to anyone, he asks why they seek the Bands if they can just strap thirty-two armbands to someone, and is politely told that they can't. The vast majority of Allomancers and Feruchemists only have one power, and powers from different people interfere with each other. Wearing two armbands does nothing, and scientists only recently discovered how to put four peoples' powers in one band. The Bands can grant all thirty-two powers because they were made by someone who had thirty-two powers, which is vanishingly rare.

</li><li> There's an urban legend that goes as follows: When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat the problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface, and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to 300 degrees Celsius. The Russians used a pencil. However, this isn't at all true, as both Russia and the US knew beforehand that pens wouldn't work in space and instead used pencils. When pencils proved to be hazardous in space due to graphite dust and debris, the US switched to felt pens while Russia switched to grease pencils on plastic tablets. Eventually a private entrepreneur independently developed the space pen with $1 million of his own funds, and sold them to NASA <em>and</em> Russia for $3 each.
</li><li> A crew transporting a house had difficulties with an overpass that their payload was 3 and a half inches too tall to fit under. They were standing there, scratching their heads, debating how to find an alternate route, when a kid on a bicycle who was doing his morning newspaper route asked what was up, he said, "Why not just let some air out of the tires and then re-inflate them after you've passed under the bridge?" A few minutes later, the crew were on their way again. This is in fact an extremely common solution to the problem with the proviso that unless you're very close to clearing the overpass while your tires are fully inflated it won't help. Deflate your tires and you'll ruin them by the time you clear the overpass which would cost thousands of dollars to replace to say nothing of if you damage the wheels themselves. Oversize load routing is intricately planned to avoid such eventualities.
</li><li> A joke is told about a driver who gets a flat tire just outside the fence of a mental asylum. Nervous about being stopped in such a place, he quickly starts to change the tire, putting the nuts in the hubcap while he wrestles the spare on. He then accidentally kicks the hubcap and the nuts fly out, disappearing into the tall grass beside the road. Suddenly, he hears a voice: an inmate watching him from just inside the fence tells him to take one nut from each of the other three wheels and use those, and that should serve to hold the spare in place long enough for him to get to a garage and replace them. He says "That's a great idea! What's somebody like you doing in a mental asylum?" The inmate's reply is "I'm in here because I'm crazy, not because I'm <em>stupid</em>."

She decides to take over the fashion industry using a machine to swap body parts between women (such as Clover's legs, Alex's hair and Sam's teeth) and create an army of perfect models. Alex asks why she didn't just use the machine to get herself a new leg instead.

To Sombra's credit, he does fairly well, conquering both the Crystal Empire and Equestria with almost laughable ease, until the Mane Six show up and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">graphically obliterate him on-screen</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>.

He and Heffer end up coming up with a plan based on a tradition where the homecoming king from Hutchinson's class (Tiger) goes to cut the cake, which they end up rigging with a bomb that's supposed to cover him with icing, giving Filburt enough time to pop the question. As they're explaining the plan, Rocko points out that Filburt could have just gotten to Hutchinson right then and ask her since she's alone. He initially refuses to break from the plan, only for Rocko to accuse him of stalling.

I mean, why not steal potato salad instead of gold? <br/><strong>Dr. Two-Brains:</strong> Huh? <br/><strong>WordGirl:</strong> Or use the gold to buy the potato salad.

He came to a part of the manuscript when Dawkins quoted an American hater of his calling him "a cheese eater!", and Dawkins then spent two-and-a-half page trying to deconstruct how being a cheese eater could be a bad thing, where cheese was manufactured in America and if there was some correlation with that area and atheism. Penn's immediate realisation and comment?

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> is credited with using a variant of "Why don't I just shoot him?" on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>, as he was suffering from food poisoning and wasn't up for filming a long fight sequence against a swordsman. The resulting moment - Indy pulls out his gun and just shoots the swordsman dead - became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a> for the <em>Indiana Jones</em> franchise and firmly established Indy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>. It also frustrated the actor playing the swordsman who had spent a lot of time learning the fight choreography only to see his big scene reduced to a 10-second joke.
</li><li> From the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>: "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j61kIL334X8">Why don't I just zap them?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" "Be-because your batteries are low. You can't get any AA's in the city. You've tried, but... gone to every chemist in the city but none of them have AA batteries."
</li><li> A Non-verbal example of this comes from the writings of Simplicius of Cilica, regarding an Ancient Greek philosophical debate. One of Zeno's Paradoxes states that it's actually impossible to leave a room, since first you have to cross half the distance to the door, then half that distance, then half <em>that</em> distance, etc., getting very close but never actually being able to leave (Greek Mathematics didn't have the concept of zero). While other logicians proposed more intricate responses to the paradox, Diogenes of Sinope (appropriately, one of the founders of Cynic philosophy) simply <em>stood up and walked out of the room</em>. Strictly speaking, not the correct way to refute a Logical Paradox, but it's hard to argue with the result. One interpretation is that the paradox was meant to show that reality is an illusion since one can physically appear to do what is logically impossible.
</li><li> In the lead-up to World War II, a visiting British politician asked Hitler how he thought the English should respond to the situation in India. Hitler's advice: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">"Shoot Gandhi."</a>
</li><li> The NSA scandal in 2013 has made many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorists</a> believe that the government can spy on anyone at any time through the internet, much like they did in a certain Orwellian novel. Those who state the simple solution that debunks this - it's rather easy to unplug the computer - are often scorned.
<ul><li> Related to this is the manner in which computers which have to really be secure are protected from hackers: not by ridiculously sophisticated protection software, but simply air gapping them and not having a wireless capability.
</li><li> The only data transfer method that can't be remotely hacked is physically taking the hard drive to the location.
</li><li> Similarly, for added security against hackers using webcams to spy on people, many webcams come with manual shutters or physical switches to disconnect them, and lacking those you can just put a piece of tape over the lens like former FBI director James Comey admitted to doing. Go ahead and try to hack through electrical tape. We'll wait.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of conspiracy theories, many of them are dependent on ignoring the people stating the simple solution. For example, the Flat Earth theory has convoluted solutions for why the horizon exists, why you can see the curve at sufficient heights, why you can fly around the Earth, you name it. The simple solution of "Maybe the Earth isn't flat?" will be entirely ignored.
</li><li> It was once stated that if the moon landing was a hoax, the cover-up would be so enormously complex that, in the end, it would be easier just to land on the moon. Not to mention that while we actually did have the technology to land on the moon in 1969, we didn't yet have the technology to realistically fake it.
