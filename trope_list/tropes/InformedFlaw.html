</div></div><p>Much like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>, an Informed Flaw is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> that simply doesn't have any real effect on the event or character. It can come up in one of two forms:
</p><p></p><ol><li> The narrative tells us about a flaw, whether it be through a character, the narration, or some other source. The flaw then doesn't materialize and nobody would have ever thought of it if the segment describing said flaw was removed.
</li><li> Alternatively, the flaw in question might be showcased as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>. After their first scene (where it will usually be pretty contrived and blunt), it will evaporate for the rest of the work. Think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a>, only compressed to a single scene and not given any natural resolution.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In either case, the defining part is the total abandonment of the flaw after its introduction, with it playing no role and thus having no importance. Often, it comes about because a character is decided to be too unrealistic, so they add in a token flaw or two to add some flavor. Other times, it's just to pad out some of the length. However, most of the time, it's a result of careless rewrites.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfallibleBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfallibleBabble">Infallible Babble</a> ensures that it's never a case where the characters talking about the flaw are misinformed, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander">spiteful</a>.
</p><p>This is often seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> trait, especially when it's a flaw that would actually be pretty awesome were it not for the consequences (e.g. substance abuse, nymphomania, etc.).
</p><p>Clumsiness is by far the most popular of the informed flaws, since it can be showcased once (so that another character can heroically save them) and then doesn't affect the plot or actually detract from the character's personality or motivations for the rest of the narrative. Alternatively it can be used a few times for comedic effect but can also be ignored as the plot demands.

They are milked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a> at various moments, without interfering with the character's ability to do the things the plot expects them to do.
</p><p>Remember that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a> - many examples on the page are negative, but that does not make the trope negative in nature. (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Playing with a Trope</a>.) A common variation that is NOT the result of poor writing is where the character believes that they have a flaw (e.g. a big nose) because of, say, past teasing or bullying, but to any viewer, it is obvious that such a flaw is nonexistent.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>: Hana has difficulty connecting with other people. She never made friends beyond Arashi before coming to the future. She's a loner, who just plain <em>can't</em> make friends because of her headstrong, stubborn nature. This gets claimed repeatedly by Hana herself and Arashi, when the series shows the complete opposite. Hana seems to quickly connect with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGirls">Fujiko and Chisa</a> and hangs out with them frequently, several guys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet">end up crushing on her</a>, and her headstrong, stubborn personality is something that the members of the other Teams often mention to be an <em>impressive</em> quality about her. Only two people seem to heavily dislike her — Ango and Ryo. And Ango is implied to find her annoying because the two of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">too similar in their stubbornness</a>, while also finding her stubbornness to be attractive, and Ryo dislikes her simply because her presence annoys Ango.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids dub</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> gives Yusei entomophobia for apparently no other reason than to add an element of fear to his duel against an Insect duelist - despite the fact that his character shows no obvious outward signs of being afraid of bugs at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, Chris Thorndyke often complains about being rich meaning he doesn't have any real friends, and his parents never being home. While at first this seems almost true, over time, he is shown to have more human friends, more guardians, and his parents repeatedly manage to physically show up for special occasions. Being obscenely wealthy is certainly never played as a disadvantage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the episodes Usagi lists a bunch of her faults, one of them being that she's flat-chested. Her actual appearance contradicts that.
</li><li> Then there's a later episode where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> and Chibi-Usa both agree that she's fat. In reality, her proportions are more exaggeratedly thin than Barbie's even though she's constantly portrayed as a lazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>. Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> originally intended Usagi to be slightly chubbier than the rest of the females, but you can't tell by the actual graphics.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em>: Josuke is afraid of turtles. You only hear of this in the beginning when first introduced to him, where he is initially a little tentative about helping a turtle he found.
</li><li> Musashi's kicks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> are supposedly powerful with the drawback that he isn't entirely accurate. Yet he never missed a single kick in these sports (apart from a flashback where Shin had directly blocked it). Even his rival Kotaro, who is known for his 100% accuracy instead of power, misses a pivotal kick.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Matsuda is well-known for being an idiot, but this isn't really that evident. While he does tend to goof off, and isn't the brightest guy around, he's clearly competent enough to be on the task force. Plus, you can't help but look slow when you're in the same events as Light and L. If you watch any scene where the task force discusses their next move, Matsuda will usually raise at least one good point. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">level grinds in competence</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, where he manages to infiltrate Yotsuba, discover where a secret meeting is taking place, and narrow down the list of suspects from hundreds to eight. Then when caught, he plays one fast game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a>, using an alias he's barely familiar with, and fakes his own death without showing fear or breaking character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And of course, he tops himself in the final episode</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>: During the curse-induced dreams the heroes have against the Lower Rank One fight, Zenitsu appears like a caricature of himself in Kyojuro and Inosuke's dreams as a stereotypical man with overbite teeth formation in a very exaggerated manner, that contrasts greatly with his normal appearance where no flaws in his face can be seen, and that would be okay since those were just illusionary versions of Zenitsu, however in a volume extra the author does say Zenitsu really has overbite, but outside the caricature version of him it just cant be seen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sakura is teased for having a large forehead, yet she's not usually drawn with a forehead any bigger than the other characters. That said, it's indicated that the allegedly large forehead is less of a problem than Sakura's insecurity over it, which she starts to get over after becoming friends with Ino.
</li><li> Tsunade's Mitotic Regeneration Technique (which she uses on several occasions- the battle of the Sannin, Pain's invasion and the final battle) is said to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">shorten her lifespan</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's still alive in the series epilogue, which takes place around 15 years after the final arc, and there's no indication that she's in poor health. She'd be around 70. Though her mix of Uzumaki/Senju blood from her grandparents may have helped boost her resilience and lifeforce</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>, the male protagonist, Ataru, is described more than once as being the most unattractive teenage in all of Tomobiki. However, he looks like an average teenage boy. He has a steady girlfriend before the start of the series. Unknowingly charms the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">Cute Alien Girl</a> Lum, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">refuses to let him go</a>, and other female characters throughout the series and movies.
</li><li> Yomi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> is frequently seen trying to lose weight and being called fat by Tomo, even though she doesn't really look heavy at all. However, this could simply be Tomo being a jerk and Yomi taking her more seriously than she should, since no one else calls her fat.
</li><li> Nate being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy">Ridiculously Average Guy</a> is a running gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> but he isn't nearly as generic as he is stated to be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> If a Devil Fruit user eats a second Fruit, they will not just die, they will <em>explode</em>. At least that's what Blueno claims. Thing is, there's as many things contradicting this as there is confirming it. For starters, it's never happened onscreen and nobody can relate the names of anyone who has done this. Not to mention, Blackbeard does indeed have the powers of two Fruits, having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stolen one from Whitebeard</span>, an exception that immediately strikes some witnesses as something that shouldn't have happened. However, while Blackbeard is the only one to have two and lived, nobody can claim to have witnessed an event where a user has exploded as a result of trying it. (Likely, few are willing to test it). Jabra seems to know someone who knows someone who this has happened to, and Blueno may have witnessed it himself. (Blueno does not believe <em>anything</em> he cannot confirm with his own senses, and he claims this <em>is</em> what happens if you eat a second, so he wouldn't have made the claim unless he was sure of it).
</li><li> Luffy's Gear Second supposedly places a great toll on his body, and in the Thriller Bark arc, one arc after he starts using it, Usopp gets quite worried about how much Luffy relies on it.

While it's obvious that proper use of a quirk that's well-suited to the task can enable someone to do several times better than a normal person, Midoriya places last on the test despite having one of the best scores in the ball throwing contest, and having spent months training to learn to use One For All. Even though some of his classmates' quirks wouldn't seem all that useful (for example, Koda can communicate with animals, but he places eleventh out of twenty), everyone else still places ahead of him. The anime offers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for this, with Midoriya saying that after he broke his finger on the ball test, he was too badly injured to do well on the subsequent events.

In reality, Zipi and Zape are two of the nicest people in their town, and they always want to help people. The bad publicity may be due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>, as in earlier stories the twins were slightly more mischievous and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterTwins">more prone to perform pranks</a> such as tying cans to dog tails. In later stories (the ones that are easier to find and everyone remembers), this trait is dropped, but the citizens' reaction to their pranks isn't. Another possibility is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> is at play: the comic was made in a different time where people were more strict regarding certain behaviors and may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">seen their pranks and actions as something more grave</a>.

While she's mostly self-taught, usually underequipped, and not as inhumanly skilled as some members of the group, in actual fights or on missions, she doesn't seem much less able than most versions of Robin, and can still manage to beat up dozens of thugs or sneak into top-security fortresses with the best of them.

However, the narrative doesn't particularly portrays them as anymore value than the English, and given the context of the conflict, it's the <em>English</em> who come off as worse since they are the aggressors and the French are merely defending themselves.

Robotman's metal body meant that he had no sense of touch, and Negative Man was essentially a host for a parasite—but then there was Elasti-Girl, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">could stretch and expand her body to any size</a>, even becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman">Giant Woman</a>, a power which she had full control over. It was stated that early on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">she didn't have much control over her power</a>, which ruined her acting career, but by the time of the comic, it was difficult to see the downside, and she was shown to be a very competent crimefighter. Later writers ended up retooling her powers to carry more obvious problems, such as her collapsing into a human blob if she lost concentration.

Also, all the neighborhood kids let him be manager and captain of the baseball team. Of course, this makes more sense when you know that the creator Charles M. Schulz, even when he had a wife, five children and millions of fans, still complained of being anxious and lonely. This is slightly more evident, if still underwhelming, in the animated cartoons, where the others can sometimes be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">more apathetic or ignorant of his suffering</a>.

However, she rarely got any panel time that involved anything other than complaining to Anthony about Liz - whom she turned out to have good reason to dislike. When she was shown interacting with other characters, she came off as little more than a normal, if somewhat removed person, and some thought her actions were justified when details of their marriage came to light.

Throughout the film she never exhibits any symptoms of the first two, never uses the inhaler after a couple of scenes in the opening act, and doesn't walk with any sign of a limp (and in fact spends hours dragging around a heavy suitcase).

But over the course of the series, it's tricky to say if Harry <em>ever</em> shows the traditional Slytherin virtues. He didn't know or care about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> at that point, and thought it was cruel and pointless even when he heard about it. He's not shrewd, cunning, or ruthless; in fact, his major flaws are that he's hotheaded, impulsive, and cares too much. On top of that, the major Slytherin flaw is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>, but not only is Harry essentially a rich celebrity who has little to be ambitious for, but he consistently treats this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">an annoying burden that he'd prefer not to have</a>.

Precisely, "degenerative damage in half the major joints in his body and a back that was compacted enough for a fifty-year-old," none of which slows him down at any point. He needs to stretch at the start of the first book, he wakes up stiff halfway through the book, it gets a brief mention once or twice in the second or third books and then is never mentioned again. This wouldn't be that big a deal, but he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalEpilogue">not lounging on a beach sipping a drink</a>, he's running and gunning with people half his age.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Holmes' drug use is this in the first few books. Naturally, since A. it wasn't really all that out of the ordinary for the time, at least for those of Holmes' bohemian lifestyle; B. he mainly does it from boredom when he doesn't have a case, and the stories are all about the cases; and C. Watson eventually gets him to kick the habit, it just doesn't come up. Adaptations like <em>The Seven Percent Solution</em> love to push this angle for all it's worth.
</li><li> Watson lists several of his own "vices" in the first book, which include being lazy, hating arguments and noise, and getting up at odd hours at night. Seeing as how he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a> recovering from being wounded and ill, these hardly count as vices and do not appear in later stories after he recovers. He also says that he has "another set of vices when I'm well", none of which are ever actually depicted in the stories either (there are subtle allusions that hint that these mysterious vices may include gambling and <em>possibly</em> womanizing, but they are never shown). Of course, he <em>is</em> the narrator; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">maybe he's editing out the parts he's uncomfortable with?</a>
</li><li> In "The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place", Watson mentions for the first and only time that he spends half his wound pension gambling on horse races. For story purposes this is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">an excuse for him to know something about people associated with the sport</a>, but he had never really shown much interest in this before (or mentioned spending that much time making bets or watching races). Some adaptations have run with this somewhat offhand remark and given Watson a general compulsive gambling problem.
</li><li> Holmes also has a number of flaws in the first book which were pretty much forgotten afterward — in particular, his deliberate ignorance of everything not directly connected to the study of crime. In <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> he claims to know nothing of literature or astronomy; in later stories he demonstrates considerable knowledge of both.

It's a minor plot point in the first novel (when his singing actually starts a bar fight), but after that is mostly just something that the other characters will occasionally mock him for. This could be partly because he tries to take singing <em>lessons</em> over the course of the series (which covers over two decades in-universe), and partly because by the standards of the setting he's in (rock and its derivatives are unknown and there are common species with innately more melodic voices than humans) his singing style <em>is</em> much harsher than anyone's used to. Whether and how much it's an actual flaw (as he's making music for magic rather than audience entertainment) is never really clear.

If you actually break down their genealogy, though, out of the line of seventeen Targaryens who held the throne, only Aerys II and Maegor I were truly insane. Aegon II, Aegon III, and Baelor I had mental issues but either owed them to trauma or were largely functional outside of them, a number of others had issues with their rulership but were quite sane, and overall, most Targaryen monarchs seem to have been at least pretty good. Some have inferred that these kings were merely the best of a bad crop, but even then, they seem to have been pretty lucky with those coin tosses until very recently.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novel "Immortal Coil" has android antagonists who are supposedly incapable of applying the information they gather to personal growth or change. Yet either their personalities have profoundly altered since their creation, or the (organic) Old Ones were <em>profoundly</em> stupid to craft a race of androids with an obsessive hatred of non-cybernetic life and then go on depending on those androids for more than the time it takes to switch them off or pick up a firearm.

It doesn't help that Bella's blood smells super-delicious to him and to his knowledge that has only ever ended badly for the human involved. This is arguably less an informed flaw and more a case of self-doubt that turned out not to be justified.
</li></ul></li><li> Edward says at a few points that humans find vampires naturally frightening, and thus try to avoid them. Given that the entire town all but hero-worships the Cullens for being so beautiful, mysterious, generous, and so on, that's kind of hard to buy. Of course, we're later told that vampires have physical features meant to lure humans closer, so it could just be a case of the author not being able to make up her mind/remember what she wrote.
</li><li> Another alleged flaw of the vampire race is that they need the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> to protect them from being exterminated by humans. This seems a baseless fear since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires in Twilight</a> have none of the traditional vampire weaknesses (unless you count sparkling in sunlight), but do have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, are nigh-unkillable even if they don't use either of the above, and can easily create a whole army of new vampires. Add in powers like foreseeing any danger (like an incoming human army or cruise missile), and the Cullens alone could take on a country and win, even if the humans are aware of their existence.
</li><li> Bella claims that she just doesn't get along with most people, having no friends in Phoenix besides her mother. The instant she gets to Forks, everyone she meets clamors to be her friend. Not to mention that while she insists she's uninteresting, she gets the attention of Edward, who it is stressed had no interest in most folks outside of his vampiric family, ever since his transformation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iwq6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2iwq6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iwq6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">albeit through the plot device of her blood smelling especially attractive to him</span>.
<ul><li> Alternatively, Bella is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">narrator</a> so this could just be her self esteem issues talking. Plus her mass appeal seemed largely due to her being the new girl from an exotically distant locale rather than because she was especially good with people. Self esteem issues or no, though, the depictions of the various characters over the next few books show most of them wanting to be Bella's friend, wanting to go out with her, or being bitterly jealous of her.
</li></ul></li><li> Leah is often described as a shrew of the highest order, to the point where <em>Breaking Dawn</em> has Jacob finding it extremely weird to have a civil conversation with her, and everyone agreeing that the miserable life she's living is her own fault. While Leah does say some not nice things, a lot of her "jerkishness", like trying to convince Jacob to stop pursuing Bella because she's getting married, makes a lot of sense. Not to mention that her "shrewish" behavior started after her she lost her fiance to her cousin, turned into a werewolf, went through the stress of her dad dying, and generally had her whole life ruined and screwed up. It is not surprising that haters of the series see Leah as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic">Unintentionally Sympathetic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobie</a>, garnering a <em>massive</em> fanbase in the process.
</li><li> Jessica and her group, with the exception of Angela, are described quite differently than what they are. Bella says they're shallow, annoying, clingy, and rude. Indeed, right after meeting Jessica, Bella thinks to herself that Jessica just wants to be her friend to be popular, but we never find out what made Bella think that. In <em>Midnight Sun</em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel">P.O.V. Sequel</a> starring Edward) his mind reading depicts them this way, too, but many people feel this is out of character, and essentially Meyer trying to confirm her assertions. Basically, Jessica was already popular, and Bella was never sociable enough to help her with that even if she weren't.

However, she has just spent <em>the entire novel</em> bonding with a tribe of foreigners, advising them on Xyian politics and medicinal techniques, and trying (successfully) to keep her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with their king stable.

The fact that the Moor Group were fighting <em>to protect themselves from being slaughtered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></em>, who they had unsuccessfully tried to reason with before, is never really acknowledged.
</li><li> In one book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em>, Wedge Antilles' childhood friend Mirax teases him about his ego, saying that it's so big he thinks he can control it. Wedge's pride is barely shown at all — in <em>Wraith Squadron</em> he puts up with one of his pilots saying that at twenty-eight he's too old for the job to a point and then challenges her to a race and wins, but he doesn't even rub it in. He once goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">spectacularly destructive but strategically unnecessary strafing run because a TIE pilot and the ground defenses "irked" him for almost shooting him down,</a> but that incident is never followed up on. Wedge is happy getting little credit, and once when playing a gambit for the benefit of one of his pilots regrets that credit will go to him and not them. Granted, Mirax <em>also</em> says (in the same dialogue, no less) that as a redeeming characteristic, he usually <em>can</em> (and does) keep it in check. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">And those few times he doesn't, it's usually his enemies that are the worse off for it.</a> He's got much more of an ego <em>after</em> the X-Wing novels, admittedly, though those are the books which show him in the most detail.

She manages to impress the Gamemakers enough that they give her a practically unheard-of eleven in the ratings, her prep team adore her, the Capitol are rooting for the "girl on fire" very early on, Peeta outright says in his interview with Cinna that a lot of boys back home have a crush on Katniss and generally speaking people tend to flock to her despite Katniss being rude and surly most of the time.

By contrast, the one-shot villain Trajectory uses Velocity-9 but it causes both an addiction and a mental breakdown that results in a split personality and its effects end up killing her.

Except, the reason she does so bad at her attempts to conquer Westeros is because she <em>listened</em> to her advisors who gave terrible advice; she didn't take King's Landing straight away because Tyrion and Varys advised her not to.

This seems to be the case even after he turns back fully to the side of evil (he never chows down on Luke, for example, despite on multiple occasions being given a good reason to do so. Ditto for Doyle, who he must have been lugging around for more than a day). Peter Petrelli, on the other hand, pretty much chops open the head of <em>every single person</em> he meets after acquiring Sylar's ability, despite (unlike Sylar) receiving no apparent tangible benefit from doing so. This becomes even more baffling when Sylar learns how to take powers without killing but <em>decides</em> to do so anyway (it's fun for him), leading one to assume the hunger talk was nonsense and Peter is so thick he felt the compulsion because he thought he would.

Even if she could see reasonably well in daylight, she should have been <em>blind</em> at night - after all, retinitis pigmentosa is also known as <em>night blindness</em>.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks">book series</a> Vicki has serious problems navigating at night.

While he is often described as being cranky and intolerable before moving in with Frasier, flashback episodes generally portray him with the same pleasant, easy-going personality he always has.

This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> to a degree in the episode "Dial M For Martin," where the plot centers around the question of whether Daphne's services are still needed (with a predictably belaboured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> ending). This is alluded to all the way back in the pilot. Martin only needed part-time help, but Daphne needed a permanent live-in job and her agency sent her there by mistake. However, Daphne was the only applicant that Martin liked and thus was hired (to Frasier's chagrin).

Other than Burns occasionally breaking down under pressure and making human mistakes, we don't see him actually kill every single patient he's given, and handles about the same number of wounded as any other doctor. There are, however, numerous episodes where one of the other doctors has to operate on one of his patients again, or step in on his operations, because he was too impatient or simply too arrogant to do it right the first time. He also tends to get easier cases with routine operations. There's certainly enough of these episodes to hold up the idea that he's incompetent, simply not that he's 100% lethal (which is more the others mocking him than making a statement of fact).

Except her untrustworthy acts include smuggling a young druid boy out of Camelot to save him from execution just for having magic.

While it might not have been quite as fancy as Monica and Rachel's, it was still a pretty good looking and decently kept apartment.
</li><li> Chandler being bad with women in later seasons. Early in the show, writers occasionally make him shy about chatting up women or women being put off by a joke that falls flat. However, he's usually viewed as being the "funny one", able to swoop in and charm women with a laid back attitude and humor. His problems with women are pinned down as having commitment phobia or not getting women in the first place. After his relationship with Monica kicks off, he's increasingly written as the guy that can't even chat women up and mocked by the gang for being so bad with women. This is despite being the only guy in a stable, functional, happy relationship with a beautiful woman while Joey and Ross are single, divorced, pining for people they can't have, or otherwise completely dysfunctional about women.

Even then, two other Doctors are there to assist him, so it's not even that the War Doctor crosses any lines that none of his other selves would cross.
<ul><li> However, this is something of an in universe example, as due to the time manipulation, no iteration of the Doctor, except the eleventh (being the latest iteration involved) can remember the events, so they all THINK the War Doctor did something much worse than he did (killing the Time Lords, instead of saving them).

She is, but it takes until "The Caretaker" (the sixth episode of Series 8) before it manifests in her behavior whatsoever, and even then we get episodes like "Kill The Moon" and "Flatline" where the Doctor purposefully gives her direct control over situations and she is hurt by the Doctor not wanting to take charge.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A standard trick by powergamers in tabletop RPGs is to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight">a character flaw that will have almost no impact on their character</a>, to reap the benefits (flaws usually come with perks, or extra XP). A common example is taking a social flaw, and then to simply never speak in character.
<ul><li> Most DMs of these systems get wise to this after their first experience or two and start limiting character flaws players can take. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> 4th edition rulebook went out of its way to encourage DMs to make certain flaws unavailable to characters who are never likely to get into a situation where they matter.
</li><li> Conversely it is often seen as the responsibility of the DM to ensure that characters run into situations where there flaws will come into play and ensuring the player roleplays the flaw.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> played this straight by giving you character creation points for flaws. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> corrects it by making flaws work by granting you additional experience after any session where they came up and caused you actual problems — so if you choose a flaw that never causes you any problems, you don't get any benefit from it, either.
</li><li> Any system that includes a "Nightmares" flaw is generally ripe for this, mainly because most DMs/GMs/Storytellers aren't willing to waste time coming up with elaborate, horrifying nightmares for one character and likely bogging down the session in the process, and many systems only describe the consequences of the character being tired from lack of sleep or nerves without applying actual mechanical penalties in the flaw's description. This often results in a grumpy, obnoxious character with little patience, which is what your average munchkin is looking to play anyway.
</li><li> Somewhat famously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> had the flaw of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Weirdness Magnet</a>. This was popular among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">min-maxers</a> for the expedient reason that player characters are invariably Weirdness Magnets already. And due to the way the flaw was written, once one character had it, there was basically no effect if everyone else took it as well since it was already a party-wide effect that didn't stack. Not to mention, there's the angle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">"So... the downside to taking this flaw is that I get to go on ''more'' exciting adventures and be the center of attention?"</a>
</li><li> One way many tabletop games avoid this sort of problem is to attach flaws to related perks, providing a benefit at the expense of a flaw (for example, being able to deal more damage at the cost of also receiving more), thus ensuring that in any situation where the benefit can be reaped, the flaw also comes into play.

<ul><li> He was designed to be a moron in the same way GlaDOS was designed not to kill all of Aperture's employees with deadly neurotoxin.
</li><li> The worst possible decision he could make would be to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stay in control and let everything explode</span>, and every smart decision he makes is allowed by his programming because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their final outcome if he succeeds</span>.
</li><li> GLaDOS is just lying about, or misinterpreting Wheatley's actual role.
</li><li> He was designed specifically to distract GLaDOS and runs like the Facts Core. If the Facts Core constantly gave out incorrect facts you would be quick to just do the opposite of whatever it said. However, now and then it actually produces a correct fact which means you either always assume it's wrong and when a correct idea comes up you do the opposite and fail, or it forces you to analyze each one to check against the "broken clock being right twice a day". This is supported by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlaDOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlaDOS">Gla DOS</a>'s claims comparing Wheatley to a "tumor".

</li><li> At the very beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, people talk about how Lucca's made yet another "crazy invention", and sarcastically say they hope it doesn't blow up like all the others. Over the course of the game Lucca then proceeds to invent a teleportation device (the Telepod), a portable flamethrower (her Flame Toss attack), a portable hypnotic device (her Hypno Wave attack), a knockout device (her "Zonker 38", which she can use to rescue Crono), a supply of potent hand grenades (her Napalm and Mega Bomb attacks), a device capable of controlling warps in the space/time continuum (the Gate Key), fixes and improves on a piece of futuristic technology that's been rusted out for over 300 years (Robo), and discovers a way to harness solar energy and use it as a weapon (the Wonder Shot).
<ul><li> The teleportation device manages to make someone vanish instead of successfully teleporting them the second time it's used (though that isn't really her fault - it only made Marle vanish because her magical pendant (powered by Lavos, no less) interfered with it), and many of those (flamethrower, grenades, Wonder Shot) are literally inventions that blow up or blow other things up — they're just <em>supposed</em> to do that.
</li><li> Lucca's father Taban fits this too. He's amazed that their teleportation device works, but he then proceeds to develop a series of increasingly effective pieces of body armor for Lucca (the Taban Vest, Taban Helm and Taban Suit), and also converts solar energy into a device capable of increasing its user's physical power (the Sun Shades).
</li><li> One of his devices <em>did</em> cripple his wife. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At least until Lucca uses time travel to change that, though he would have built a device that <em>almost</em> crippled his wife.</span> Perhaps this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">Once Done, Never Forgotten</a>.

In game, he's completely insane and not healthy-looking, but we never see him anywhere near meth or impaired by need for it (especially in contrast to a character met later on who is a cocaine addict, and talks about almost nothing besides his coke addiction to the point where it reaches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a>).
<ul><li> Landon Ricketts' bio describes him as 'vain and pretentious'. The worst he gets is slightly arrogant about his genuinely phenomenal gun-slinging ability, when poking fun at Marston for 'barely being able to shoot straight'. His self-deprecating attitude towards himself (and his love life), his genuine devotion to the people of Mexico, his compassion towards John Marston and his thoughtful but straight-talking manner actually lead to him coming across as humble, the precise opposite of what his bio says. Especially in contrast with the genuinely vain and pretentious Mexican politicians. He <em>is</em> vain and pretentious in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> zombie DLC, though.
</li><li> In the game itself, John taunts Javier Escuella by claiming Abigail Roberts (John's wife) always thought he (Javier) was a creep. This never comes up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">prequel</a>, where Javier is presented as one of the nicest members of the gang. Also, John tells Abraham Reyes that Javier was a man with "passion but no love" who cared little for anyone else, a stark contrast to his portrayal in <em>RDR2</em>.

In particular, the Azshara-Twilight Highlands zeppelin is described as a virtual deathtrap filled with volatile gas, fuel that "shouldn't even be moved, much less flown", and even the parachutes will most likely kill you. Yet the zeppelin is brought down by dragons near its destination.

For the rest of the game, Link comes off as far from lazy with all running around the surface killing a small army of demons he does. This is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, as Link is often portrayed as having to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodMorningCrono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodMorningCrono">dragged out of bed</a> and put to work at the start of quite a few of the games - but not being a morning person is not the same thing as being lazy.

Throughout the game, Link is barely ever lazy, especially with all the dungeons, many creepy things he slays that would normally send even well-trained adult soldiers running for their homes, and surprisingly athletic things he does that wouldn't be normally expected of a boy of 10 years old. Not to mention all those cool front flips he does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> while chasing after the Skull Kid.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> states that Coach injured his knee during his days in college football and it sacked his football career. On top of this, Coach is overweight, which would make running and climbing more difficult for him. The injury and weight problem is shown off in the opening intro scene where Coach has to take a breather from climbing up several flights of stairs (while the younger and more fit Nick, while still noticeably out of breath, is blazing on past him), but Coach is not hindered at all during the actual game.

The justification for this is that using the thing too much can result in a disease called "Teleportation Related Dementia", even though in the original game there's literally nothing preventing you from just translocating everywhere for an hour or so, other than maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">someone sabotaging the disc</a> or trying to take a flag with them.

It's been variously claimed that his homegrown martial art is completely useless, that he can't land a single hit on Sakura despite her lack of experience, and that the Gadoken is about as powerful as a slap. Though Dan's power has fluctuated over his history, he's still an incredibly muscular man who can jump six feet straight up and shoot fireballs out of his hands, even if only for a few inches before it disappears. It can get especially disconcerting when playing <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, where Dan's Gadoken is actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">stronger</a></em> than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Hadoken</a> when it hits.

He also uses a number of moves that are illegal in boxing — that's how he got kicked out of professional boxing — but this is just a vicious edge to solid technique.

This tends to throw players for a loop, as Kishuna in gameplay is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> with HP and evasion only matched by the final bosses, a permanent field of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> surrounding him, and the ability to teleport on top of this (which he tends to do so whenever he seems endangered). This makes him one of the most difficult enemies to take down; standard strategy is to just pray for a crit. He can't attack at all, but it's rather hard to imagine Nergal couldn't find some way to put such a phenomenal asset to good use.

Not only is he far more level-headed compared to the other three routes, his anger towards Edelgard and the player is generally more justified, as here you're invading both Faerghus and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">the Leicester Alliance</a> and forcibly reuniting them under the Empire, in addition to gunning for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Rhea</a> and the Church of Seiros.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a>: Vegas</em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> turns out to be Gabe Nowak, a teammate from the first mission who was effectively the team screw-up, and the prologue of the sequel decides to show us exactly how much of a screw-up he was... and it fails completely at this. Not least for the fact that the AI of Gabe and Logan for this mission is <em>far</em> superior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">might-as-well-be-brain-damaged duo</a> of Mike and Jung you're babysitting for the rest of the game, but because Gabe keeps making decisions that the writing goes out of its way to portray as "bad" and not how you should do things, only for the gameplay to do nothing to bear this out - for instance, one of the first encounters with enemies has him suggest throwing a frag grenade to just kill them all immediately. Logan suggests that if you do so, other terrorists will hear it and execute their hostages, but you can then do exactly as Gabe suggests for <em>every</em> encounter, except maybe the one that <em>actually</em> involves hostages, and not suffer for it in the least. The worst he gets is accidentally getting the hostage negotiator killed, because it legitimately seemed like the terrorists were going to just kill the hostages anyway; being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">narcissistic</a>, which only really comes up twice, once bragging that he could take a sniper out from twice the distance the player does and once assuming he performed a breaching maneuver perfectly; and, when the team is ambushed and he gets incapacitated after defusing a bomb at the end of the mission, angrily assuming that the team deliberately set him up to get killed for his screw-ups - screw-ups that aren't nearly as numerous or terrible as the game wants you to think. It's telling that when you finally confront him at the end of the game, he has to completely change track to being angry at you over <em>covering for</em> his screw-ups and not letting him learn from them - with the added bonus of him covering for the nonexistence of his own flaw by fabricating a completely new informed flaw for Bishop (their supposed "babying" of their recruits and not letting them mature on their own - even though Logan, the other recruit from the prologue, is as competent as you can get considering he's the player character in the previous game).
</li><li> A plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a>: Defender of the Future</em> is that the Foe stole virtues (actual literal virtues, like Compassion and Intelligence) from the dolphins, but in practice the 'altered' dolphins don't <em>completely</em> lack those traits. One of them helps you solve a puzzle in the level <em>Master of Forgotten Skills</em>, and another is desperate to save his ill father. It's more like those traits are weaker, or fewer dolphins have them, than that they are gone completely.

All the characters still react as though it grates on their ears. Stories have varied for why this is—one of the more common explanations is that Liz's voice is essentially her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> (being part dragon), and it's less her lack of talent and more that she's throwing sonic magic into her song that makes it unpleasant.

His hatred of Lee was evidently from knowing the man was a convicted murderer rather than anything to do with race, as he seemed to treat Clementine and Glenn with the least hostility out of anyone in the group (though that's not saying much) and even cares enough about Clementine's well-being to threaten Lee if anything happens to her. Justified though, since Clementine was quite young when she knew him and would have easily misinterpreted it as racism because she <em>didn't</em> know about Lee's murder conviction.
</li><li> A recurring plot element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> games is that X was the first robot to be built with true free will, implying the cast of the classic series to be just following their programming. As the series runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a>, most stories involving Mega Man (who predates X by a good while) don't really show him as much less free-willed than X.

<ul><li> Mario is said to be impatient, hotheaded, and impulsive sometimes, yet this is rarely seen in the mainline games, where he is normally a kind-hearted, cheerful and generally optimistic guy. Spin-offs show that he can be overly competitive at times and quick to anger, but even then, he's still normally happy-go-lucky.
</li><li> While Luigi is commonly known for being the brother who scares easily, some characters will outright treat Luigi as if he is incapable of doing anything <em>at all</em>, despite that he has been shown time and time again that he is just as capable and heroic and brave as, if not more than, his older brother. Not to mention he's just as physically powerful and has a higher jump.
</li><li> Peach is stated to be "Sassy and stubborn, but cute" although in the mainline games, she hasn't shown an ounce of sassiness nor stubbornness and is mostly depicted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">gentle, optimistic, and sometimes naive manner</a>. The spin-offs, however, tend shown her sassy and stubborn side a lot more. This was mostly stated as a design choice of what Peach should represent rather than her actual personality, however.
</li><li> In the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario RPGs</a>, characters will mock Bowser's size with various insults like "overgrown turtle", "pudgy", "tubby", and so on. Bowser is large overall, but he's nowhere near fat.

However, while a bit dense, Crump time and time again is very good at laying traps and out thinking the heroes, managing to outfox Mario and friends <em>twice</em> in the second dungeon, once by rigging a fake Puni Orb pedestal to entrap them, and once by letting them find the Crystal Star and swiping it from under their noses. He also only resorts to fighting them when he has superior numbers or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Magnus Von Grapple</a> at his side, otherwise he relies on said trickery or traps which tend to only fail to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> nobody could have reasonably seen coming like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Mario's brand new "curse"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Cortez and his crew unexpectedly aiding Mario's team</a>.

It ends up being downplayed, since after Taiko (the guy Rie likes) indicates that he's suspicious of Runa (Rie's best friend), Rie and Taiko end up feuding. That being said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Runa's actually innocent, so while Rie may not be entirely rational when it comes to Runa, that doesn't change the fact that she's <em>right</em>.</span>

However, when you fight the demons in game, none of them show even the faintest hint of fear. None of them retreat, beg, surrender, or offer to betray their peers in exchange for mercy. Instead, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">throw themselves at the Slayer without hesitation</a>, fighting him to the last breath with the same expressions of rage and contempt on their faces that they show for their weaker victims.

</li><li> Matcluck, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer">Simple Country Lawyer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">hyperchicken,</a> is regularly referred to as a terrible, terrible lawyer. He's been put on trial for incompetence, and once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">pled insanity</a> for his client with the evidence being that they hired him. Indeed, he doesn't seem like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">a very smart guy</a> (though it's <em>Futurama;</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">everyone's pretty dumb</a>), but he's actually not an incompetent lawyer. In fact, onscreen, he has a <em>perfect record.</em> Yes, even the insanity defense.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, Jon is said to have a terrible singing voice. However, anyone with an ear can hear that Thom Huge actually has a nice singing voice. Otherwise, he would not have been asked to perform the musical numbers. Also, his ability to cook is questioned... obviously he can make lasagna capably, and presumably other dishes as well; however, when he deviates from his small store of pat recipes and experiments, the results leave much to be desired (he once used mayonnaise as a substitute for some necessary ingredient, reasoning that "it's the same color"). Even Garfield won't touch these culinary abortions.
</li><li> Quite a bit of fuss in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode is about how 12-year old Dipper has the voice of a pubescent boy whose voice is breaking. The problem is Dipper sounds like a full-grown man. His voice isn't remotely squeaky.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotWheelsBattleForce5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotWheelsBattleForce5">Hot Wheels Battle Force 5</a></em>: Kryosis is said to be incredibly arrogant even more so than Stanford to whom he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to. In the show itself he barely says much and usually functions to shoot at stuff. In his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> webisode he's portrayed as a calculating warrior who manipulates his comrade to psyche him up for a fight, which he later explains and is thanked for.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> Dib is regularly mocked for having a giant head, even though his head is the same size as any other character's.
</li><li> Homer Simpson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> fame is frequently portrayed as being seriously, even <em>morbidly</em> obese, even though he has a relatively average body type compared to other people in Springfield (his established height and weight of 6' and 239 pounds technically qualifies him as medically obese, but not by much and nowhere near the guidelines for morbid obesity). Apu, Krusty, and Dr. Hibbert, to name three, are just as fat as Homer though they're never portrayed as such, while Barney, Mayor Quimby, and Chief Wiggum are considerably fatter and the Comic Book Guy is by far the fattest of them all. However, one episode had Springfield declared the fattest town in the USA, so there's at least some acknowledgement. As the whole of Springfield is overweight, this is not so much "informed" but more normal for the town.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> plays with this a lot, such as informing the audience that a character is hideously ugly or very attractive when they look no different than anyone else.
<ul><li> In one episode, Cartman is sent to jail, leaving the other boys to single Clyde out as "obviously" the fattest kid in the class, even though he is literally the exact same shape as all the other kids other than his hair.
</li><li> Special mention goes to Ugly Bob, who was exiled from Canada for his ugliness despite looking identical to every other Canadian (and not being considered ugly by non-Canadians). It turns out that his ugliness gives him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the gorgon-like ability to turn anything that looks at him into stone</span>.
</li><li> In "The Hobbit", Wendy points out her and the other kid's imperfections (like Bebe having acne and Jason having freckles, yet they're not shown); like herself having pimples and crooked bottom teeth (neither of which are visible), and points out that Stan has short stubby legs, even though they look just like everyone else's. What's weirder is that Jason does have an actual identifiable flaw (a prematurely receding hairline).
</li></ul></li><li> As stated by multiple characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>, Numbuh One's butt is supposed to be ridiculously huge, but it looks just about the same as the other character's.
</li><li> Broadside, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>, is stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in his bio</a> to be a complete nervous wreck. He's a Triple Changer whose altmodes are a space jet and an aircraft carrier, but he's both afraid of heights and gets seasick easily. You'd think this'd make him near-useless, right? Well, not really; Broadside's fears have been ignored by pretty much every bit of media. In fact, given his (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary">usually</a>) massive size and his membership into the elite and high-risk Wreckers in the comics, Broadside's pretty consistently shown to be the opposite of scared or ineffectual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: Morty is described as being "as stupid as Rick is smart", but the show never provides any evidence of his stupidity. He's smart enough to easily grasp scientific and philosophical concepts well beyond most people his age, like how the existence of a Multiverse with inter dimensional travel makes moot the concept of objective meaning in life. Furthermore, his plans are almost always more well-thought-out than those of any other character (albeit they usually fail anyway due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">the Universe screwing him over</a>), in "Total Rickall" he single-handedly solves a scientific mystery that was too difficult even for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius">Impossible Genius</a> Rick, and in "Mortynight Run" he manages to trick the <em>mind-reading Fart</em> which implies impressive mental discipline. The only time we've ever seen him do something to suggest that he's as stupid as is claimed — struggling with a basic math problem in "M. Night Shaym-Aliens" — was later revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">part of a simulation</span>.
