The audience just thinks it's the best special effects they've ever seen in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">high school play</a>. Particularly impressive because Inu Yasha, a half-demon time traveler, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustRuinedTheShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustRuinedTheShot">interrupted in the first place because he didn't understand that it was just a play</a>, forcing Kagome to ad lib wildly to keep things from falling apart in all directions. The funniest part is the <em>actual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> who challenges Inu Yasha to a duel, drawing a prop sword.

<ul><li> The Magic-using teachers in charge of the Academy use this trope to recruit thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> to help them fight off an army of robots. Thankfully, none of the weapons being used by either side were lethal. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> herself was even amused by this and decided to play along, announcing herself publicly as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> Towards the end of the manga, the barriers between the Old World and the Magic World start to break down around Mahora, unleashing an army of demons onto the unsuspecting populace. Fortunately, their attacks are only rendered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">dangerous to modesty</a> against Old World humans, so they do the exact same thing again to help the students defend themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, Lina, Gourry, and Amelia, while hiding from bounty hunters, end up getting hired by a theater company that is doing a play... <em>about</em> Lina as an entry in a theater contest. Then, when the hunters finally catch up to them, they're able to seamlessly integrate the whole fight into the play and clear Lina's name (in the play, at least). And they also win the contest, too!
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em> has the eponymous heroines appearing on-stage during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> (and fellow teammate) Urara's debut to defeat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, and the crowd goes wild.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Two seasons before that</a>, during a school production of Romeo and Juliet, Juna decides to attack our heroines, forcing them to transform and fight him off. The audience doesnt seem to mind, however, and think its part of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime, Team Rocket frequently interrupts Pokemon battles, contests, plays, and other types of performances to steal Pokemon — and it almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">never works</a>, as the audience gets angry and starts booing them or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">joins the protagonists in attacking them</a>. They do this so often that the only reason they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">keep getting away with it</a> is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. The only time it <em>does</em> work is when they invade a water ballet at the Cerulean City Gym and convince the audience it's still part of the show — until the Meowth balloon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereWasADoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereWasADoor">crashes through the roof</a> and Ash and Brock jump into the pool to help.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara!</a></em>, Amu has to catch an X-Egg on sports day. After she transforms, she's still in plain sight of everyone, but they can't see the X-Egg, only her — and she's in a cheerleader costume. So when she's jumping and skipping around, they all assume that it's part of an elaborate cheerleading routine. Her friends catch on very quickly and assist with their own cheerleading squad to make the "show" better.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> OAV episode 2, a rogue combat robot begins launching missiles during a Halloween fireworks display in Elenore City Park, and the audience mistakes the missile explosions for fireworks (as do the pyrotechnicians themselves: "Whoa, when did we send up that really big one?") Kei and Yuri borrow some of the rockets and use them to <em>kill</em> the robot — earning even more applause from the crowd in the park below.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>, Mugen and Jin end up on stage during a Kabuki drama battling the police because they were sheltering a Westerner (and because Mugen skipped out on his restaurant bills). The fight and subsequent break-up by Dutch and Japanese officials is seen as a terrific performance by the audience.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneratorGawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneratorGawl">Generator Gawl</a></em>, Gawl ends up performing superheroic feats on stage while fighting another Generator, all to the amusement of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a>-esque actors and the audience.
</li><li> During the "Death-T" arc of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> manga, Kaiba actually had an audience present who thought it was a publicity stunt to promote a theme park. (Although they only saw the parts that Kaiba and Mokuba participated in personally.) Indeed, it even took the heroes a while to figure out it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a> that threatened their lives.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> anime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegretfulTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegretfulTraitor">Dennis</a> has come to regret his actions as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, but feels that he doesn't deserve redemption. Being the entertainer that he is, though, he decides to make his final act something the onlookers could be proud of. He turns himself into a card, sealing himself away from the world. While the general audience applauds this "illusion," the heroes know that this isn't an illusion, and know what Dennis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">has really done</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NuraRiseOfTheYokaiClan">Nurarihyon no Mago</a></em>, there was supposed to be a staged Oni attack, after which a class president candidate would take credit, via pre-recorded video, for vanquishing the monster. When an Oni <em>actually</em> shows up, the protagonist fights it off, and the delivered video was timed so well that nobody caught on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Naturally.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>: Ranma, who is locked in female form, decides to protect his secret by fighting Mousse "disguised" as a girl. Akane is initially skeptical, only to be amazed when it actually <em>works</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Akane:</strong> "They're actually buying it. Way to sell 'em, Ranma!"
</div><ul><li> In another chapter, Romeo and Juliet is being played as part of a drama contest. Several characters are fighting on stage over who gets to play the lead roles. The resulting play is barely recognizable, but this seems to be taken as some sort of deliberate twist; they win the contest anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoltyRei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoltyRei">SoltyRei</a></em>, a priceless emerald ends up in the middle of a water circus, causing everyone to fight over it, resulting in Solty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost being electrocuted. Rose saves her at the last second</span>. The crowd bursts into applause, and the circus' announcer can be heard in the background congratulating them, as if it were all part of the show.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> revolves around a play about a female thief, with a famous actress portraying the victim.

Often, when fans see wrestlers behaving in certain ways — such as the opposing wrestler seeming upset when the opponent he just trash-talked in an interview a few minutes earlier is in real pain or has stopped moving for real — they'll realize that what's going on in the ring is real. If the incident happens during a live televised event, the announcers will emphasize clearly that the incident was not part of the night's planned events; such happened when Owen Hart was fatally injured during a live pay-per-view event (after a failed stunt) and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> suffered a heart attack while doing play-by-play commentary on live television.

The story has always been that Rogers suffered a mild heart attack not long before his scheduled match with Sammartino. Sammartino, in latter-day interviews, claimed that Rogers was in excellent health and that he was simply unwilling to cooperate with promoters who had booked Sammartino to win the match. The lack of existing records from that time, plus the strict maintenance of kayfabe from that era and the fact that virtually all of the other key players including Rogers are either deceased (Rogers died in 1992; another with direct knowledge of what actually happened, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon">Gorilla Monsoon</a>, died in 1999; and Sammartino died in 2018) has made unclear whether Rogers' health was all show or if he legitimately had suffered a heart attack.

The wrestlers then capitalized on the improvisation made by the referees, throwing each other out of the ring in turn while declaring himself the winner before McMahon ordered that they restart.
</li><li> Kris Levin, a referee better known for promoting women's wrestling, tried to save Jessie Brooks's match vs Mark Hauss during Warriors Of Wrestling and Tier 1's 2016 <em>Empire State Of Mind</em> by playing off a New York State commissioner's interruption as this, hoping the fans' predictable response would let it happen. It didn't work, the commissioner maintained men couldn't wrestle women in the state. While it was eventually made clear the commission representative mistakenly applied New York's boxing rules to pro wrestling, "wrestling men in New York" basically summarized the career of Jessie Brooks and the match was allowed to take place after the scheduled event, by then pretty much everyone in the audience realized it wasn't at work.

Their third Attainment allows them to literally explain away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Paradox</a>, with explanations ranging from "We're filming a movie" to "We're doing a pyrotechnics demo" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">the utterly blatant</a> "We're calling down magic from the Supernal Realms."

Even the villain firing an <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribauldequin">organ gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on stage will be seen as mere "opera grotesque."
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a> crossover game <em>Midnight Circus,</em> the eponymous Carnival is surrounded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">Glamour</a> Veil designed to hide the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">true nature of the circus</a> from its audience, usually by ensuring that anything unusual or disturbing is dismissed as part of the show. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Koba's Progressive Klown Show</a> usually ends with a spy from a rival clown troupe being discovered, then chased down and eaten by Koba's enslaved werebear - all dismissed as special effects by the Glamour-baffled audience. If the player characters attempt to rescue the spy, the Glamour Veil just weaves them into the show, complete with comedy pratfalls and sad trombone music; the audience buys <em>all of it,</em> even when Koba's bodyguards open fire on the players with handguns and flamethrowers.

<ul><li> Vaclav Havel's <em>Temptation</em>, an adaptation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Faust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Faust">Faust</a> story set in Communist Czechoslovakia, subverts this trope. It ends with one of the actors catching fire following what appears to be a special effects accident, at which point firefighters run up onto the stage and put it out.
</li><li> Real life example and possible inversion: Warner Le Roy's play <em>Between Two Thieves</em> concerns a small traveling company of Jewish and Christian actors who "improvise" a trial debating the life, works, and existence of Christ. At several points in the play the discussion onstage becomes so heated that members of the audience stand up and join in the argument. Of course, all of these audience members are plants, actors who are part of the play (and the whole thing is completely scripted), but during productions it's not uncommon for <em>actual</em> audience members to stand up and begin making comments as well, requiring the actors to, in turn, actually begin improvising in order to address the real audience member's point in such a way as to get him or her to sit back down, then steer things back the the script. Ironically, the better the actors are the more <em>likely</em> unscripted audience participation is, because they're more like to think it's <em>not</em> All Part of the Show and feel free to break in as well.
</li><li> In the first scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat">Show Boat</a></em>, when a jealous Steve assaults Pete in full view of the town's finest, Captain Andy tells them it's just another preview of the melodrama he's presenting (having already introduced Steve as the leading man).
</li><li> Played with in a stage show by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheMaryWhitehouseExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheMaryWhitehouseExperience">Rob Newman and David Baddiel</a> which ends with the two comedians coming back on stage, sitting down and telling the audience that the show's over and they can leave. Obviously nobody knows what to do at this point.
</li><li> Amusingly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeMoreChill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeMoreChill">Be More Chill</a></em>, where Michael realizes that the entire cast of the school play getting brainwashed is <em>not</em> part of the show because, in his words, "This is <em>way</em> too good for a school play."
</li><li> On the subject of <em>Pagliacci</em>, that itself is an example of this trope: The second scene is devoted to the actor playing Pagliaccio (a clown) confronting his wife about her lover in the middle of a performance of the show within a show, while the audience praises the play. It culminates in him murdering them both, and ends just as the audience starts to realise what happened with perhaps one of the most famous lines in opera: "La commedia è finita!" ("The comedy is over"). Leoncavallo even claimed it was based on a true story, no less.
</li><li> There are also various stories based on this sort of thing happening during an opera - one of Agatha Christie's involves <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca">Tosca</a></em>, with the actor playing Scarpia getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> (and it turning out the soprano was so good at Tosca because her life had parallels to it).

</li><li> In the intro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CountdownVampires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CountdownVampires">Countdown Vampires</a></em>, when the dancers are turned into vampires, the audience thinks it's part of a show... right up until they start attacking people.
</li><li> The opera scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> culminates in an on-stage battle that begins when the heroes and the monster, Ultros, fall out of the rafters and onto the stage. Having previously promised <em>not</em> to ruin the show, Locke attempts to play the battle as part of the performance (although he turns out to be a hilariously bad actor). And for his part, the conductor plays along and leads the orchestra for a special Boss Theme. At the culmination of the fight, Setzer shows up out of nowhere and abducts Celes, and the entire main cast pursues — leaving the opera house director, whose show has been completely derailed, with no option but to promise the audience the plot will be resolved in "Part Two".
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, the Tantalus theatre troupe stages a production of "I Want to Be Your Canary", as part of a plan to kidnap Princess Garnet. Four of the game's eight player characters accidentally end up on-stage (which is actually the deck of an airship) in the middle of the performance. Although the characters play along at first, the performance eventually falls apart, with Steiner attempting to thwart the "kidnapping", Tantalus attempting to fly the ship away, and Queen Brahne ordering weapons fired at the ship. Then it's revisited <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the ending, to reveal that Zidane lived, and to reunite him with Garnet</span>.

<ul><li> In a flashback in the same game, Laguna and his friends Kiros and Ward are shown taking roles in a movie because they've run out of money. Kiros and Ward are supposed to operate a Ruby Dragon costume for Laguna, playing the hero, to fight; a <em>real</em> dragon wanders onto the set instead, forcing Laguna to fend it off with his prop gunblade while his co-star runs for it.

At first the audience is terrified, but you and your companion act as if it is all an act and the crowd begins to cheer for you instead, blissfully unaware of the danger they are standing right next to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Hitman: Blood Money</a></em>, there is a mission set at the Paris Opera House where some actors are rehearsing Tosca. You have the option of replacing the prop pistol with a real pistol so that your target, the lead singer, is killed for real during the execution scene. Naturally, it takes a while for the audience watching the rehearsal to realize it wasn't part of the show.

At first everyone's confused, but assumes it must be part of the act. That is, large set piece suddenly falls down onto the stage, seemingly crushing Trucy underneath it, at which point the audience goes into a panic. While Trucy was unhurt, the guy that tumbled from the coffin was indeed found to have been fatally stabbed with a sword, and Trucy is arrested for involuntary manslaughter over a magic trick gone wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Although it actually turns out the victim wasn't dead when the coffin was opened.</a> He was playing dead as part of a prank on Trucy that was set up by the true culprit, before being subsequently murdered by the true culprit via a complex remote-murder plan in the midst of the resulting chaos.</span>
<ul><li> In the same case, this trope is also referenced during the testimony concerning the magic show's fire trick.

He asks it, rhetorically, what he should do with it—whereupon a loud, creepy-sounding voice answers, "YOU SHALL SURRENDER TO THE DARKNESS!" It turns out that the rats are playing a video game, and they have it hooked up to surround sound. (Interestingly enough, Potophie comments that Dan's screams "sound almost real!")
</li><li> The punchline of several strips worth of fighting a cage-clank (along with Zeetha being stripped down to her underwear, again) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> has Gilgamesh attempt to explain to the locals... <a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20081031">who toss a bunch of coins at him<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, clearly thinking that this was all just an act.

<ul><li> In "Hamburger Dinner Theater", Linda decides to open a dinner theatre in the restaurant, much to Bob's chagrin. The acting is dismal, and the patrons are unimpressed, until an <em>actual</em> robber enters and decides to milk the situation for all it's worth, singing throughout his entire robbery, much to the audience's glee and Bob's consternation. <em>Linda</em> herself even begins to <em>sing with him,</em> lamenting later that he won't be around for the following night's performance despite the fact that he <em>robbed the store.</em>

This results in an impromptu dance number/fight scene with all of the other kids and the team dancing while at the same time avoiding getting shot by the robot's lasers. One proud father remarks:
<div class="indent"><em>"That's my daughter up there dodging deadly laser blasts!"</em>
</div></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> introduced the rock-girl ghost Ember, who apparently planned to take over the world through the hypnotic power of her music. On the night of a world-wide, televised concert, Danny goes to stop her, resulting in a big fight filled with energy blasts. The crowd oohs and aahs, and even Jazz remarks "Mindless teenage rebellion <em>and</em> a killer light show? Is this the best concert ever, or what?"
<ul><li> Another one occurred in "Beauty Marked" when Danny accidentally declares Sam the winner of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest">Beauty Contest</a>. The host places a magical tiara on her and while fireworks are going off, Sam is taken to the Ghost Zone.

</div></li><li> And again in "Less Than Hero". During a superhero battle, Leela's mother is feeling scared and confused, and so assumes she's wandered into an off-Broadway play. Response: "No, there are too many people here." This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">technically accurate</a>; the phrase "Off Broadway" (And the connected "On Broadway") does not refer to physically being located either on or off the street named Broadway, but rather refers to the size of the theatre and audience it can hold. If there are enough people present then it literally cannot be an "Off Broadway" show.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, when Coldstone is introduced, Broadway, Brooklyn, and Lexington initially think the sounds of him and Goliath fighting are just the sound effects of the movie they're watching. Played for laughs, as "I don't remember any explosions in <em>Bambi</em>."
<ul><li> In another episode, when Lexington and Goliath are fighting the Pack, some witnesses believe they must be filming a movie or something.

When she thinks the pie contains kiwis, which she is allergic to, she completely loses it and starts yelling that she is going to die, when the audience doesn't react, she yells, "This isn't part of the show!!" Of course, considering how the performance was going up to that point, the audience could be forgiven for not taking it seriously.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> had the passengers on a sea cruise captured by a pirate (who was also a MAD agent), demanding they sign over their respective financial assets.

</li><li> During a wrestling show in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>, the manager of such uses some Egyptian artifact to turn himself into a humanoid jackal. Kim, Ron, as well as two of the league's top wrestlers, Steel Toe and Pain King, work together to fight him. All the while the audience is none the wiser. In fact two of the audience members comment on the "special effects" at first but then dismiss the whole thing as "fake".

They end up hijacking a viking themed casino ship to which June, along with Ray Ray and Monroe, have to commandeer a tour boat to follow them which still has the tourists on board. June makes them believe the chase is part of the tour she dubs the "Battle of Orchid Bay" as well as the vikings catapulting items at them and subsequent sinking of their ship.
</li><li> Near the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madballs">Madballs</a></em> episode "Escape from Orb", the Madballs put on a show for the people of Earth and end up getting chased by the villainous Badballs during their musical number. The audience's joyous cheers indicate that they think the Badballs' intrusion is part of the performance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>, this is played straight every single time Dethklok performs. In the first episode, one concert-goer talks about having his middle finger and ring finger <em>bit off</em> by one of the band members who then smoked them, and he's perfectly fine with that!
<ul><li> Injuries to fans are apparently so common that the band's manager REQUIRES concert-goers to sign a pain-waiver, so that no matter what happens during the show, Dethklok cannot be held responsible.
</li><li> Every single performance by the band has catastrophic repercussions. In the first episode, the stage is dropped (as a huge spiky cube) just outside the target-zone, landing on top of the audience, after which the sides of said stage open up and kill or maim even more paying fans.
<ul><li> In a later episode, they apologize for what happened during a concert in Finland, and performs a new national anthem they wrote for the Finnish people. The result is that they awaken an ancient demon that proceeds to devour everything it sees.
</li><li> In "Fat Kid In The Dethharmonic", they perform they only ever concert with a philharmonic orchestra, and include an impressive laser-show in the concert. Using high-energy lasers that cut through people like a hot knife through butter. At the end of the concert, only Dethklok remains.

Thankfully, they manage to make the whole thing pass for a Sci-Fi retake of the play with John's help.

The mobster sticks his knife in his teeth and nervously starts tapdancing.

(Even Channel 5 newscaster Kent Brockmann chuckles as he whimsically remembers the incident.)

Also done in one season two episode for Bumblebee and Bisk after they're mistake for props at a rock concert- Bisk was there to steal equipment and Bee went to stop him. Their on-stage fight was, of course, wildly loved by the audience and Bumblebee got his picture taken with the band afterword.

Since it's Halloween W.I.T.C.H. and their magical allies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself">able to walk around in their transformed states</a> and their battle with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is thought to be a skit put on for their school's carnival. One of their classmates praises the "special effects" that let the girls fly around and attack the other "actors" with elemental powers. The audience is still cheering at the end when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phobos takes the Seal of Nerissa from her and announces his intention to conquer the universe.</span> Encore!

<ul><li> In live theatre this kind of behavior is the exact opposite of what actors onstage are supposed to do if there is real danger present. If, say, a door falls (something that the audience will notice but won't get anyone hurt) then continue as normal (<em>maybe</em> with an off the cuff remark to make clear that you did see what happened but are going to ignore it). If a chandelier falls (which could very well kill or seriously hurt someone), then break character and get the hell out of the way, then don't move a muscle until stage management figures out what to do next. This is largely because something severe enough to cause actual danger is likely the most visible symptom of a larger problem (like the supports being weakened and collapsing) and the last thing stage management needs while trying to control the situation is the actors trying to continue the show like nothing happened. This kind of behavior could very well break something else if people aren't careful.
<ul><li> On the other hand, for anything short of actual danger (a missing prop, a costume malfunction, a problem with the lighting or sound effects, etc.), the general expectation is that the actors <em>will</em> continue the show as if nothing happened.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IslaFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IslaFisher">Isla Fisher</a> nearly drowned due to this. During production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowYouSeeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowYouSeeMe">Now You See Me</a></em>, while filming the water tank scene, Isla got stuck and began banging on the wall of the tank to alert the crew. They didn't realize that anything was wrong because her actions were exactly what the script required her to do. Luckily, she was able to untangle the chain and free herself.
</li><li> See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">Fatal Method Acting</a> for real life incidents involving death on stage.
</li><li> In his spoken word shows, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins">Henry Rollins</a> talked about an instance where he was playing a festival in Australia. They were playing some new songs in their set and he forgot the words to a song. He tried to invoke this by going over to each member of the band and "rocking out" with them while they kept playing until the song was over.
</li><li> Redd Foxx died of a heart attack while at rehearsals for his then new sitcom, <em>The Royal Family</em>. Infamously, everyone thought Foxx was reprising his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHeartAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHeartAttack">I'm coming, 'Lizabeth</a>" comedy routine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em> and didn't realize anything was amiss until after he had lost consciousness for some time and didn't respond to requests to get up.
</li><li> Health food enthusiast Jerome Rodale died onstage during a taping of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickCavettShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickCavettShow">The Dick Cavett Show</a></em> in 1971. Rodale had been Cavett's first guest, and he remained on the guest couch when newspaper columnist Pete Hamill came on as the second guest. Rodale made a loud snoring sound and his head fell back. Hamill said "This looks bad", and the audience laughed. Legend has it that Cavett said Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?, but Cavett denies this. The episode was being taped, and thus never aired.
</li><li> There was a Hardcore-band at one point, who took the whole "Hardcore-mentality" a bit too far. They would consequently beat up paying customers and smash venues, as part of their concerts. Then again, what else can one expect from a band with "Riot Extravaganza" in their name?
</li><li> A particularly grim example: when the space shuttle Challenger exploded, some astronauts' family members watching on TV thought it was a second-stage rocket ignition and cheered. Probably a lot of therapy time devoted to that topic.
</li><li> In one tragic incident, an accident with pyrotechnics lit the ceiling of a Rhode Island club - <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire">The Station<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - on fire during a performance by the band Great White. The performers didn't notice for a while, and the audience thought it was all part of the show. Eventually, the band noticed and fled, the crowd panicked, and the club collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 100 people.
</li><li> In 1987, comedian <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Shawn#Death">Dick Shawn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was playing a politician reciting cliches. One of them was "If elected, I will not lie down on the job." He then fell down and didn't get up. The audience thought it was part of his act. When he didn't get up, there were actually catcalls from people who thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">he was dragging it out too long</a>. Finally someone went on stage, examined him and said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThereADoctorInTheHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThereADoctorInTheHouse">Is There a Doctor in the House?</a>"? Another audience member performed CPR on him, but it was to no avail. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">The audience didn't know if the people coming on stage to examine him were part of the act or not</a>. They weren't: he died of a massive heart attack on stage. There is sad irony in the fact that he had played Lorenzo St. DuBois (the actor playing Hitler) in the scene in <em>The Producers</em> described above.
</li><li> Similarly, when British stand-up Ian Cognito collapsed and died on stage during a club show in 2019, his reputation for weird behaviour meant that it took a while before the audience and stage crew realised he wasn't faking.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1093549/The-actor-nearly-died-stage--slashing-throat-REAL-knife-bizarre-prop-mix-up.html">This story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is about a Viennese actor who nearly died onstage after stabbing himself in the throat with a knife that he thought had been blunted. The audience, thinking the spraying blood was just really good special effects, began to applaud. It was only after he collapsed and wouldn't get up that they began to suspect something was wrong.
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a>'s work was based on making his audiences wonder if what he was doing was for real or not; when people learned he was dying of cancer, more than a few simply thought it was an act. He died in 1984, but some still think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding">He's Just Hiding!</a>.
</li><li> An actor playing Judas in "Jesus Christ Superstar" was supposed to have fake hanged himself, and everyone clapped when he actually had his windpipe crushed and didn't realize what was going on until the actors all dropped their roles and ran to try to untie the ropes.
</li><li> At Burning Man in 2007, a man hanged himself inside a two-story tent. His friends thought that it was performance art.
</li><li> Stage magician Chung Ling Soo (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxreigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxreigner">actually</a> a white American named William Ellsworth Robinson in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface">yellowface</a>) was famous for the trick where he would appear to stop a bullet with his teeth. In his last show in 1918, the act went wrong and a real bullet got fired into his chest, and he expired with the line: "Oh my God. Something's happened. Lower the curtain", the first and last time he spoke English on stage in his Chinese persona.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> singer Bon Scott said he saw current lead singer Brian Johnson perform with his band once. Bon Scott enjoyed the performance because at the end, Johnson started rolling around and screaming. "And to top it all - you couldn't get a better ending - they wheeled the guy off!", said Bon Scott. He thought it was all part of the show, but what really happened was that Brian had appendicitis.
</li><li> During some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>'s early tours, he would fake-hang himself at the end of the concerts. On at least one occasion, however, this went completely wrong when the safety-line snapped and the musician began to <em>actually</em> be hanged on-stage! A stage-technician did notice the mistake and hurried to have the gallows removed from the stage so they could save Alice Cooper without the audience knowing that he had nearly been executed.
</li><li> In the 1980's, Motley Crue's bassist, Nikki Sixx, was so badly addicted to drugs that when playing live, he would occasionally collapse without a warning. This can even be seen in the "Wild Side" music video, near the end where Nikki is seen tumbling down the slightly angled stage. Everyone assumed it was just a part of the act. However, in a live-recording from the same show, Vince Neil says immediately after the song "We've got a small problem here... Our Bass Player is down."
</li><li> British comedian <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Cooper#Death_on_a_live_television_show">Tommy Cooper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died of a heart attack during a performance on live television. The audience thought his falling down was part of the act and laughed, until they realized he was seriously ill.
</li><li> Part of the reason Per Yngve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">"Dead"</a> Ohlin's suicidal behavior went untreated was that most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> shows featured gore and self-mutilation routinely. When Dead slashed his wrists and almost bled to death in one show, the audience assumed that once again he had meant to simply draw blood from elsewhere. It also didn't help that fellow bandmate Euronymous wanted Dead's self-mutilation to go to even more ridiculous lengths to build Mayhem's reputation and infamy, and he lied frequently about the state of Dead's mental health to prevent intervention as well as frequently egging him on.
</li><li> The military uses the phrase "Real world" in order to avert this during drills. Anything that is not part of the drill will be declared "Real world".
</li><li> If there is a real emergency (like an injured soldier) during a training exercise with the Canadian Forces, they'll immediately call out "No Duff No Duff No Duff" which tells everyone that said emergency is not part of the exercise and that real assistance is needed.
</li><li> The 2012 Aurora Massacre began, according to witnesses, when the assailant set off a few smoke bombs during a midnight screening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>. A few moviegoers thought it was a stunt pulled off by the movie theater to promote the film until gunshots rang out. It didn't help that the shooting took place during a battle scene.
</li><li> In order to avoid this, many Renaissance Festivals give their employees/in-character actors a code word to say if something is <em>really</em> wrong, so the security people (many of whom are in costume themselves) know what is an act and what isn't.
</li><li> A very major reason that assassin John Wilkes Booth escaped the night he killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. After the gun was fired, the report muffled by the sound of laughter from the play, Booth jumped down from the balcony they were on and broke his foot. The audience thought it was part of the production. Probably the <em>only</em> reason he managed to escape was because it was during a play.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that Booth was a very successful and well-known actor in his lifetime, possibly contributing to the initial confusion.
</li></ul></li><li> A Moroccan filmmaker making a movie about illegal immigration hired some locals to serve as extras. The actors were supposed to be playing young Moroccans who illegally cross the Strait of Gibraltar in rickety boats in the hope of starting a better life in Europe. Unfortunately, <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/851936.stm">filming had to be canceled after all 70 of them fled across the Strait for real only a few days before filming was supposed to start.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/art-basel-stabbing-mistaken-for-performance-art.html">stabbing incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that occurred during the Art Basel show was mistaken by some onlookers for an art performance.
</li><li> Ian Curtis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a> suffered from epilepsy and would frequently have tonic-clonic seizures on stage. These were mistaken for his stage moves by the audience, as Curtis was known for herky-jerky movements on stage. Things went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a> when his epilepsy became public knowledge among fans, who started to attend concerts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">specifically for the purpose of watching Curtis have on-stage seizures.</a> The already depressed Curtis consequently lost his remaining enthusiasm for live performing, convinced that nobody cared about the actual music anymore and just wanted to watch him flail about, as reflected in the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Closer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Closer">"Atrocity Exhibition"</a>: <em>"For entertainment they watch his body twist; behind his eyes he says 'I still exist.'"</em> Yikes. It's widely accepted nowadays that this conviction was one of many major catalysts for Curtis's suicide in 1980.
</li><li> According to contemporary accounts, when Sophie Blanchard's (the first female balloonist) balloon caught fire during one of her performances (an accident which caused her death), most of the audience initially cheered and applauded Madame Blanchard for such a spectacular show.
</li><li> Occurred tragically in Brazil during location filming of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VelhoChico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VelhoChico">Velho Chico</a></em> when the actor Domingos Montagner got into difficulties while swimming in a river at the end of the day and drowned. Reportedly, local residents were aware of him and another actor calling for help, but thought it was a fictional scene.
</li><li> In 1969, Allen Funt, the creator and original host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CandidCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CandidCamera">Candid Camera</a></em>, was on a flight from Newark to Miami that got <a class="urllink" href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/youre_not_on_candid_camera_allen_funt_was_on_hijacked_flight">hijacked by terrorists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who were seeking to divert the plane to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cuba">Cuba</a> in order to gain asylum. A few passengers who recognized Funt thought that the whole thing was another prank, despite Funt's protests that it was very real and the hijackers' attempts to ignore the obvious humiliation they were receiving. Only when the plane landed in Havana did they realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">this wasn't a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Candid Camera</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">prank</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> were once playing a show at the Fillmore East when someone threw a Molotov cocktail into the grocery store next door. The flames started coming into the theater, and even though firemen came into the theater, the audience was convinced it was part of the act, especially when Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend kicked them off the stage. Eventually, Bill Graham, who ran the theater, was able to get the audience to leave, the band surrendered to the police, and were let go when they admitted they thought it was part of the show as well.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s first live performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> had part of the stage set catch on fire from a pyrotechnic effect after the first number, with the audience cheering until the fire department arrived, as they assumed it was just another of Pink Floyd's famous visual effects on stage. The rest of the concert continued without incident.
</li><li> Inverted by magician Harry Blackstone. At a performance in Decatur, IL, Blackstone announced that his final illusion was so spectacular that he would have to do it in the street outside, and directed the audience to leave row by row. Only when they were outside did they find out that the building was on fire and that Blackstone had used the idea of an illusion as a ruse to ensure an orderly evacuation.
</li><li> While performing his hit song Lonely Teardrops during a show produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark">Dick Clark</a> in September 1975, singer Jackie Wilson collapsed after the line My heart is crying. The audience applauded, believing it to be part of the show. Sensing something was wrong, Clark ordered the band to stop playing. Wilson had suffered a heart attack, and the ensuing lack of oxygen caused him to slip into a coma, in which he remained until his death in January 1984.
</li><li> At the 1906 premiere of the musical <em>Mam'zelle Champagne</em>, architect Stanford White was shot dead by mentally unstable millionaire Harry Kendall Thaw. Most of the audience thought it was some kind of elaborate party trick at first, but then it became clear that White really had been killed.
